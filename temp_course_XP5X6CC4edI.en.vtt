00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.080
is a little test for you to practice and see how&nbsp;
much you've learned are you ready let's go let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.760
start with the present continuous take a look&nbsp;
at this example here Sarah is in her car she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:05.080
is on her way to work she is driving to work this&nbsp;
means that Sarah is driving right now at the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.800
of speaking the action has not finished to create&nbsp;
the present continuous start with the subject for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:24.040
example I you she he it and so on then you add&nbsp;
the conjugated form of to be for example I am you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:33.720
are he she it is ETC we call this type of verb an&nbsp;
auxiliary verb this is because the verb be like I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.840
am you are Etc in this case in this specific tense&nbsp;
it's not actually the action it's not actually the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.840
verb this verb B is going to help us construct&nbsp;
the tense so now we have the subject we have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:59.920
auxiliary verb be after that we add the ing form&nbsp;
of the verb this particular ing form is called the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.440
gerund in English but to keep things very simple&nbsp;
and to not use too many technical terms I'm just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:14.840
going to call it the ing form so to create the ing&nbsp;
form or the gerund form of the verb you just take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:25.440
the normal verb and you add ing to the end of&nbsp;
it so work becomes working do becomes doing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.560
drive becomes driving if the verb ends with an e&nbsp;
for example like in drive as we saw in our first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:43.560
sentence you remove the E and then you add in so&nbsp;
it becomes driving the same happens with write&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.480
you remove the E and then you add in to create&nbsp;
writing to sound more natural in English you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:01.600
combine the subject and our auxiliary verb to be&nbsp;
together so I am becomes I'm you are becomes your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:09.360
she is becomes she's Etc using contractions will&nbsp;
make you sound much more natural so get used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.200
using them and hearing them because you will hear&nbsp;
them a lot so now you know how to use the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.880
continuous to talk about an action happening&nbsp;
right now at the time of speaking but you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.080
also use the present continuous to talk about an&nbsp;
action that's in progress and hasn't finished yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.160
let me give you an example I'm reading a really&nbsp;
good book right now I'm not reading the book now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.440
in this moment it's not in my hand off camera&nbsp;
it's not happening now but I started reading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.600
the book and the action of reading that book&nbsp;
continues I haven't finished reading the book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.920
I am still continuing to read the book so we can&nbsp;
use the present continuous to talk about actions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.440
that haven't finished yet we are still in the&nbsp;
middle of that action I'm still in the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.880
of reading my book to make the negative form all&nbsp;
you need to do is add not after the auxiliary verb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:21.240
be so I am not reading a book or I'm not reading&nbsp;
a book Let's now do some activities to help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.600
practice the present continuous take a look at&nbsp;
these pictures and tell me what's happening use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.560
the verb above the picture to help you construct&nbsp;
the sentence pause the video if you feel you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:42.360
a bit more time so for number one you can say&nbsp;
she is taking a picture she's taking a picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.840
or you can use the contracted form she's taking&nbsp;
a picture for the second one you can say they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:57.840
are crossing the road they are crossing the road&nbsp;
or the contracted form they're crossing the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:05.600
now we're going to look at the present simple look&nbsp;
at this example Alex works as a nurse he drives to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:14.120
work every day we use the present simple tense to&nbsp;
talk about things in general like facts or we use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:21.720
it to talk about routines and habits Alex works&nbsp;
as a nurse is a fact it's something constant it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:29.640
something general it's true and he drives to work&nbsp;
every day is a habit it's a routine to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.160
present simple tense for regular verbs all&nbsp;
you need to do is take the infinitive form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:42.160
of the word for example to work and you remove&nbsp;
to so you're left with What's called the bare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.560
infinitive once you're left with that all you&nbsp;
need to do is just conjugate it for he she it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:59.440
this is very simple a lot of the time you just add&nbsp;
an S so you have I work you work he she it works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:09.200
they work we work and that's it you only conjugate&nbsp;
he she it in English when you're talking about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:17.640
present simple let's try another one for example&nbsp;
to drive what do we do we remove to so we're left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:26.640
with drive then we only conjugate the third&nbsp;
person so he she it and what do we add to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:38.360
end an S so we say I drive you drive he she it&nbsp;
drives we drive they drive remember he she it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.400
the only one that changes to make the negative&nbsp;
form of the present simple all you need to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:55.480
is add do not or does not for he she it and you&nbsp;
add that after the subject so I do not drive she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:04.480
does not drive you only need to conjugate do in&nbsp;
this case so you don't need to say she does not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:13.080
drives that's a really common mistake you only&nbsp;
conjugate does he does not drive she does not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:19.400
drive again if you want to sound more natural&nbsp;
then make sure you use the contracted form I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:26.600
don't drive she doesn't drive so let's practice&nbsp;
the present simple with some activities complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.280
these sentences using the following verbs&nbsp;
and pause the video if you feel you need more

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:48.160
time number one I speak English and French number&nbsp;
two John and Jane do not go to the same school or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:57.000
John and Jane don't go to the same school number&nbsp;
three the shop closes at 6:00 p.m. so it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.640
only one that changes the shop Clos closes because&nbsp;
it's a singular here we're treating it like it so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:13.840
he she it closes the shop closes so remember&nbsp;
to add that s now let's compare the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:20.440
continuous and the present simple so you use the&nbsp;
present continuous to talk about things that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:28.560
happening at or around the time of speaking or&nbsp;
when an action started in the past and it isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:36.240
complete yet you use the present simple to talk&nbsp;
about more General things like facts or to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:43.200
about things that happen repeatedly like habits&nbsp;
or routines here are some examples to show you the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:50.960
difference I'm filming a video right now which&nbsp;
is true I'm in this moment and telling you I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:59.000
filming a video right now I'm talking about an&nbsp;
action as I am doing that action but I film a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.720
video video every week is a routine it's something&nbsp;
repeated here are now some exercises to help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:12.840
practice the difference between present simple&nbsp;
and present continuous look at the underlined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:19.120
verb and decide whether it's correct or not if&nbsp;
it's not correct then I'd like you to correct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:25.840
it feel free to pause the video if you need&nbsp;
more time number one John is looking for a

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:34.680
job this sentence is correct because&nbsp;
the action is not complete yet it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:41.480
still happening he is still looking for a&nbsp;
job number two water is boiling at 100°C&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:52.320
this is incorrect and the reason for&nbsp;
this is because it's a fact so water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:59.600
boils at 100° C and number three the last&nbsp;
one she is walking her dog every every

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:09.360
day this one is not correct because it's a&nbsp;
routine every day we need to use the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:17.680
simple she walks her dog every day now let's move&nbsp;
on to some past tenses and ways that you can talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:26.280
about past actions take a look at this sentence&nbsp;
I went to a party last week this is an example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:33.800
of the past simple we use the past simple to talk&nbsp;
about actions which started and finished in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:40.560
past as we know that the party happened last&nbsp;
week it's definitely finished the party is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.800
continuing now it finished last week so we know&nbsp;
to use the past simple to create the past simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:55.440
tense in English with regular verbs all you need&nbsp;
to do is add Eed D to the end of the verb so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:05.000
verb work becomes worked want becomes wanted and&nbsp;
so on if the verb ends with a Y you change the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:14.680
Y into an i and then add Eed for example study&nbsp;
becomes studied there are three possible ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.280
to pronounce the Ed endings in English and if&nbsp;
you'd like a full lesson to know when and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.720
to pronounce those Ed endings then check out my&nbsp;
video on that I will leave it linked Down Below&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:32.680
in the description I have also included a little&nbsp;
summary in the downloadable PDF lesson notes so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.760
you can practice your pronunciation there&nbsp;
as well keep in mind that there are lots of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.920
irregular verbs in English which don't follow&nbsp;
this Ed ending rule for example write doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:59.240
become writed it becomes wrote C is not seed&nbsp;
it's saw go is not goed it's went and run is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:07.320
not runed or runed which I hear a lot it's ran&nbsp;
so keep an eye out for irregular verbs in English&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.760
because there are many when you want to use the&nbsp;
negative form all you need to do is add did not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:21.960
after the subject so yesterday I went to the&nbsp;
park in the negative form it becomes yesterday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:29.160
I did not go to the park it's a really really&nbsp;
common mistake for Learners to say yesterday I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:36.480
did not went you don't need to conjugate that&nbsp;
main verb all you need to do is say did and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:44.240
that's it so yesterday I did not go to the park&nbsp;
let's now practice the past simple with some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:51.840
exercises let's read what Laura is saying here&nbsp;
as you'll see it's all in the present tense but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.120
listen carefully because I'm going to ask you some&nbsp;
questions after we finished reading I usually get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:07.640
up at 7:00 and have a big breakfast I walk to&nbsp;
work which takes me about half an hour I start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:20.040
work at 8:45 I never have lunch I finish work at&nbsp;
5:00 I'm always tired when I get home I usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:31.400
cook a meal in the evening I don't usually go out&nbsp;
I go to bed at about 11:00 and I always sleep well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:38.920
now let's mention we're talking about Laura's day&nbsp;
but in the past number one what time did Laura get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:52.520
up Laura got up at 7:00 got is the past simple&nbsp;
of get it is irregular number two did Laura eat

00:15:52.520 --> 00:16:04.320
lunch no Laura did not eat lunch or she&nbsp;
didn't eat lunch remember we don't say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:11.560
did not ate we don't need to put the main&nbsp;
verb into the past as well because did is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:17.520
already telling us that it happened in the&nbsp;
past number three what time did Laura go to

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:30.160
bed Laura went to bed at 11:00 went is the&nbsp;
past tense of go go is an irregular verb in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:37.280
English now let's look at the past continuous&nbsp;
the structure for the past continuous is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:44.560
similar to the present continuous so if you&nbsp;
remember the present continuous is the subject&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:51.840
then the verb to be which is our auxiliary verb&nbsp;
our helping verb and then the ing form of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.840 --> 00:17:01.760
verb the main verb for example I am doing all we&nbsp;
need to do for the past continuous is just change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:13.120
the verb to be into the past so I was doing I&nbsp;
am doing I was doing that's very simple to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:22.040
so remember that the verb to be is irregular so I&nbsp;
am doing you are doing he she it is doing becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:31.640
I was doing you were doing he she it was doing&nbsp;
here's another example for you this time last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:39.360
year he was living in London here we use the past&nbsp;
continuous he was living in London because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:47.480
action happened for a long period of time in&nbsp;
the past here's another example at 9:00 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:58.840
I started playing tennis at 1100 a.m. I finished&nbsp;
playing tennis at 10:00 a.m. I was playing tennis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:06.440
here I'm using the past continuous with I was&nbsp;
playing tennis because I was in the middle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:14.040
doing a longer action in the past you can also&nbsp;
use the past simple and the past continuous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:21.920
together to talk about how a longer action&nbsp;
was interrupted by another action for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:28.760
I was taking a shower when you called me so&nbsp;
I was in the middle of doing a longer action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.920
when you interrupted that action now let's&nbsp;
practice with some activities take a look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.760
at this task here I'd like you to fill in&nbsp;
the gaps pause the video if you need more

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:59.080
time I saw Sarah in town yesterday but she didn't&nbsp;
see me she was looking in the other direction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:06.560
so with the first sentence I saw Sarah it happened&nbsp;
in the past it was an action that finished in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:14.000
past but she didn't see me again this is one&nbsp;
action that happened in the past and finished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.160
in the past but we use she was looking in the&nbsp;
other direction because this action happened for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:28.960
a longer period of time she was doing the action&nbsp;
of looking in the other direction when I saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:37.040
her so she didn't see me those two little&nbsp;
actions happened while she was looking in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:44.240
the other direction next we have the present&nbsp;
perfect in English we use the present perfect to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:51.000
talk about experiences that happened in the past&nbsp;
with no specific time given to them to create this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.880
tense you have the subject for example I and then&nbsp;
you have the auxiliary verb have this only con&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:06.480
Ates with he she it like our other verbs and&nbsp;
it becomes he she it has then you use What's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:13.880
called the past participle of the verb the past&nbsp;
participle is usually formed by adding Ed to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:21.520
end of the verb so a verb like walk becomes&nbsp;
walked just like we looked at with the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:31.880
simple so in the present perfect this becomes I&nbsp;
have walked I have walked you can also contract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:38.920
the subject and the auxiliary verb have and just&nbsp;
say I've walked again you can do that with all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:47.960
the different subjects so you have walked becomes&nbsp;
you've walked she he it has walked so bear in mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:58.160
that that has changes there has walked so she's&nbsp;
walked he's walked it's walked we'd walked and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:05.040
they'd walked walked a lot of irregular verbs&nbsp;
in English tend to have e n at the end of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:15.000
past participle so write becomes wrote in the past&nbsp;
simple but written in the past participle the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:26.960
with take took and taken or eat ate and eaten so&nbsp;
let's take a look at an example of when we use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:34.640
present perfect to talk about experiences take&nbsp;
a look at this example I have been to Japan do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:41.880
you know when I went to Japan no we don't know&nbsp;
when I went to Japan all that matters here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:48.720
the experience it's the action that's all that's&nbsp;
important with the present perfect you can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:55.400
use the present perfect to talk about actions&nbsp;
which started in the past but they continue to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:03.760
happen in the present or there is a connection&nbsp;
to the present for example I have lost my keys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:10.080
this means that I lost my keys in the past and&nbsp;
they are still lost now because with the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:18.160
perfect there is a connection to the present if&nbsp;
you say I lost my keys with the present simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:24.200
it's not clear whether you found your keys&nbsp;
or not they could still be lost or maybe you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:32.160
found them but with the present perfect when&nbsp;
you say I have lost my keys it implies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:40.440
the keys are still lost to make the negative form&nbsp;
of the present perfect just add not after have or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:49.520
has so I have not lost my keys she has not lost&nbsp;
her keys let's now practice with some exercises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:58.880
using the words in the brackets I'd like you to&nbsp;
fill the gaps for example we have he a horse he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:09.360
has ridden a horse ridden is the past participle&nbsp;
of ride ride Rod ridden it's irregular now I'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.960
like you to try with these three sentences&nbsp;
here using the verb in the brackets I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.040
you to fill the Gap with the present perfect&nbsp;
pause the video if you feel you need more

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:34.120
time number one irregular verb eaten she has&nbsp;
not eaten all the bread or she hasn't eaten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:43.280
all the bread number two I have met her before&nbsp;
or I've met her before number three he has not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:50.880
finished his homework or he hasn't finished his&nbsp;
homework now let's move on to the present perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:57.840
continuous we use the present perfect continuous&nbsp;
to talk about an action which started in the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:05.000
and it continues to happen up to the present&nbsp;
time this is formed in a very similar way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.760
the present perfect tense the only difference is&nbsp;
just adding a little bit extra so we start with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:21.720
the subject and then have or has like we looked at&nbsp;
before I have or you have he she it has remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:32.680
the third person always changes then you add been&nbsp;
so I've been you've been he she it has been Etc&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:40.480
then you add the ing form of the verb remember&nbsp;
we looked at this with the continuous verbs like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:50.840
I am doing here we can say I have been doing&nbsp;
I have been doing you have been doing he she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:58.480
it has been doing and remember you only need&nbsp;
to conjugate the auxiliary verb have so I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:05.360
have you have he she it has has is the only&nbsp;
one you need to think about conjugating here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:13.640
so here's an example a real example I have&nbsp;
been recording this video for over 3 hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:21.840
it's true so I've been recording this video for&nbsp;
over 3 hours so I'm using the present perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:28.440
tense here because I'm talking about an action&nbsp;
which started in the past and it's continuing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:36.120
to happen in the present you can also use it for&nbsp;
actions which have only recently stopped but there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:43.400
is a connection somehow to the present I'll give&nbsp;
you some examples example number one I have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:52.120
living in Spain for 2 years the action started 2&nbsp;
years ago and it continues to happen now in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.040
present with the second example I'd like you to&nbsp;
imagine that you're looking outside your window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:06.040
you you see that the sky is now clear but before&nbsp;
it was raining and it only stopped raining about 5&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:14.720
minutes ago you can say it has been raining now&nbsp;
this time we're talking about an action which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:22.320
started in the past and only recently finished so&nbsp;
with the present perfect continuous you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:29.240
it to talk about actions which started in the past&nbsp;
and only recently finished now let's practice with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.200
some examples I'm going to read some sentences&nbsp;
to give you context but I'd like you to fill the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:47.480
gaps pause if you need more time number one it is&nbsp;
snowing it started snowing 3 hours ago it for 3

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:58.240
hours it has been snowing for 3 hours&nbsp;
number two I am learning Spanish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:05.080
I started learning Spanish&nbsp;
10 years ago I Spanish for 10

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:18.000
years I have been learning Spanish for 10 years&nbsp;
number three I started cleaning my office this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:28.160
morning I finished just before I started&nbsp;
recording this video I my office all morning

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:37.640
I have been cleaning my office all morning now&nbsp;
let's look at the past perfect we use the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.880
perfect when we want to say that one action&nbsp;
happened before another action for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:50.720
Sarah had finished her homework before she&nbsp;
ate dinner she had finished her homework&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:58.320
first and then the second action was she ate&nbsp;
dinner here's another example I had eaten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:06.240
before you arrived so I had eaten was the first&nbsp;
action then after that you arrived as you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:12.440
see the structure of the past perfect is really&nbsp;
similar to the present perfect remember with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:21.600
present perfect we used I have eaten but with the&nbsp;
past perfect you just put have into the past I had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:30.680
eaten you had eaten she he it had eaten to sound&nbsp;
more natural you can contract and you can say I'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:40.640
done you'd done we'd done she'd done he'd done&nbsp;
Etc to make it negative you just add not after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:48.880
had so I had cleaned becomes I had not cleaned or&nbsp;
to sound more natural you can squish those words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:55.000
together and contract them and say I hadn't&nbsp;
cleaned now let's practice with some example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:03.240
sentences as always you can pause to give yourself&nbsp;
extra time number one the performance before we

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:14.600
arrived the performance had started before we&nbsp;
arrived number two he the door before he went to

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:28.360
bed he had locked the door before he went to bed&nbsp;
number three I my suitcase before I left for the

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:38.520
airport I had packed my suitcase before I left&nbsp;
for the airport now let's move on to the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:45.320
tense I'm going to read an example sentence&nbsp;
pay attention yesterday I got home from work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:55.080
extremely tired I had been working hard all&nbsp;
day this is the past perfect continuous you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:02.600
use the past perfect continuous to emphasize&nbsp;
the duration of an action so if you think of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:09.720
past perfect as just being one complete action&nbsp;
past perfect continuous is a longer action and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:17.320
you're emphasizing that that action happened for&nbsp;
a long time and it happened before another action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:26.400
happened so in our example sentence I had been&nbsp;
working all day I'm emphasizing the fact I had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:34.560
been working for a long time all day and then I&nbsp;
got home so that second inter interaction that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:43.640
second action is I got home here's another example&nbsp;
I had been painting the house before you arrived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:51.400
I had been painting for a long time and then you&nbsp;
arrived so by using the past perfect continuous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:57.920
I'm emphasizing the duration of the action to&nbsp;
create the structure for the past perfect Contin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:05.080
it's very easy because nothing really changes you&nbsp;
don't need to conjugate anything you just start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:14.160
with the subject then had been and then the ing&nbsp;
form of the verb for example I had been waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:22.240
in a full sentence I had been waiting for half an&nbsp;
hour when the boss finally arrived so I had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:29.000
waiting for half an hour when the boss finally&nbsp;
arrived you can also use use the past perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.000
continuous to talk about cause and effect for&nbsp;
example she was out of breath because she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.560
been running remember to sound more natural you&nbsp;
can contract the subject and had together so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:51.600
can say I'd been doing you'd been doing she'd&nbsp;
been doing he'd been doing it had been doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:51.600 --> 00:32:00.040
we'd been doing and so on and to make it negative&nbsp;
you just add not in between had and been so I had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:06.120
not been doing she had not been doing you had&nbsp;
not been doing or you can contract and you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:15.800
say hadn't so you contract had and not this time I&nbsp;
hadn't been doing you hadn't been doing she hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:22.480
been doing Etc now it's time to practice your&nbsp;
grammar with some more exercises remember pause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:31.880
the video if you need more time number one we V&nbsp;
dear games all afternoon before our mom told us to

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:41.080
stop we had been playing or we'd&nbsp;
been playing notice as well that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:47.600
when I say this very quickly I don't say&nbsp;
had been playing I say had been had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.880
playing so keep that in mind for your&nbsp;
pronunciation and it will also help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:59.720
you with your listening skills number two&nbsp;
Phil was very tired when he got home he all

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:09.040
day he had been working all day or&nbsp;
he'd been working all day number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:16.360
three the bus was extremely late&nbsp;
everyone for the bus for over an

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:23.120
hour everyone had been waiting for the bus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:31.440
for over an hour number four Maria&nbsp;
failed her exam she very hard all

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:41.400
summer she hadn't been studying very hard&nbsp;
all summer now it's time to talk about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:49.760
future when you decide in the present moment to do&nbsp;
something in the future you use will conjugating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:57.720
will is very easy because it doesn't change&nbsp;
so we say I will do so you add the verb after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:06.160
you will do she will do he will do it will&nbsp;
do we will do they will do it's very easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:12.160
you don't need to change anything to sound&nbsp;
more natural you can contract the subject&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:20.840
and will I'll do you'll do she'll do Etc now&nbsp;
let's imagine this for a moment you walk into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:27.960
a room and you see that the window is open&nbsp;
someone has left the window open so you say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:35.800
oh I'll close the window I'll close the window&nbsp;
you use will in this case because you're setting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:44.000
the intention now you can also use will when you&nbsp;
want to offer to do something for example that box&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.480
looks heavy I'll help you you can also use will&nbsp;
when you agree to do something for example I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:57.920
give you this book the next time I see you and&nbsp;
finally you can use will to make promises for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:06.000
example I'll send you the document later to make&nbsp;
will into the negative you just add not after it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.240
so I will not send you the document if you want to&nbsp;
sound more natural then you just contract will and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:22.520
not together and create won't so I won't send you&nbsp;
the document later you can also use won't when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.880
want to say that someone or something refuses to&nbsp;
do something so it sounds very very strong like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:38.000
a strong refusal for example the pen won't work&nbsp;
or imagine you can't close the window you can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.680
the window won't close it's like it's refusing to&nbsp;
close let's say when we talk about plans for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:52.040
future we tend to use will when we make the plan&nbsp;
in that moment while we're speaking for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:52.040 --> 00:36:00.960
imagine you ask me now Emma what are you going to&nbsp;
do this weekend and I have no plans I could say oo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:08.600
I don't know I think I'll go to the park I think&nbsp;
I'll go because I just decided now I made the plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:16.000
now while I'm talking to you you can also use will&nbsp;
for General future intentions and plans so it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.440
not concrete it's just one day it will happen for&nbsp;
example one day I'll travel to India I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:32.280
when I don't have a plan I have no idea idea when&nbsp;
I will go but I will go one day here's another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:41.680
example I'll see you another time do I know when&nbsp;
I will see you no but I will I intend to I plan to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:49.320
one day in the future see you sometime so you see&nbsp;
that with will we don't really have any concrete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:58.000
intentions it's not necessarily a 100% plan next&nbsp;
we're going to look at going to going to is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.160
future plans that you have already decided to do&nbsp;
so you intend to do these plans because you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:11.400
already decided to do them in the past for example&nbsp;
imagine that today is Monday and I decide I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:19.240
to buy a new phone I then make the plan to go to&nbsp;
the shop on Saturday to buy the new phone then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:27.520
on Thursday you see me and you say Emma do you&nbsp;
have any plans for Saturday and I say yes I do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:36.200
on Saturday I'm going to buy a new phone so I&nbsp;
use I'm going to buy because I made the plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:45.920
on Monday I set the intention the plan on Monday&nbsp;
the structure for going to is very simple just use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:54.480
the subject for example I and then the present&nbsp;
form of to be so I am then the phrase going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:02.600
and then the verb so I am going to visit you are&nbsp;
going to visit she's going to visit we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:09.480
to visit they are going to visit to sound more&nbsp;
natural you can contract the subject and to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:17.120
so I'm going to visit you're going to visit&nbsp;
she's going to visit he's going to visit Etc&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:24.000
here are some more examples I'm going to have a&nbsp;
coffee with my friend tomorrow you can also use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.840
going to with future actions or predictions which&nbsp;
are very very obvious for example careful you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:39.640
going to walk into that wall you're going to get&nbsp;
sick if you only eat junk food now take a look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:47.200
these sentences and complete the gaps remember&nbsp;
you can pause the video if you need more time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:59.440
number one his car stopped working last week so he&nbsp;
another one tomorrow so he is going to buy another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:08.720
one tomorrow or he's going to buy another one&nbsp;
tomorrow number two I'm too tired so I football

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:17.760
tonight so I'm not going to play football&nbsp;
tonight or so I am not going to play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:27.360
football tonight number three he bought a&nbsp;
new table but he doesn't know where he it yet

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:39.000
where he is going to put it yet or where he's&nbsp;
going to put it yet finally our last two tenses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.720
that we're going to look at in this unit are&nbsp;
actually two tenses you have already learned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.840
in this video before you learned how to use&nbsp;
the present continuous to talk about actions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:57.640
that are happening right now for example&nbsp;
I am recording a video and you also learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:04.080
about how to use the present simple to talk about&nbsp;
things which are a routine or a general fact for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:11.320
example I record videos every week take a look&nbsp;
at these examples using the present continuous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:18.720
but we're talking about the future I'm not&nbsp;
working tomorrow I'm meeting my friend this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:26.320
evening here we're using the present continuous&nbsp;
but why because these are concrete plans which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:33.080
I've already decided to do in the future notice&nbsp;
how using the present continuous and going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:38.840
are very similar because you use both of them&nbsp;
to talk about actions you already decided to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:45.920
do but the key difference here is that when&nbsp;
you know a plan or an action will 100% happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:53.080
in the future you use the present continuous the&nbsp;
present continuous sounds stronger it sounds like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:53.080 --> 00:41:00.360
100% the action is going to happen when you use&nbsp;
is going to it basically indicates to the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:08.360
person ah okay that person set the intention in&nbsp;
the past the plan has already been made but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:15.960
doesn't sound as concrete as present continuous&nbsp;
the present continuous sounds very concrete like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:22.520
100% that plan is going to happen for example&nbsp;
I can't help you tomorrow I'm visiting my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:29.800
grandparents it sounds like 100% I'm visiting my&nbsp;
grandparents no matter what that plan is not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:35.440
to change now let's look at the present simple&nbsp;
and using it for the future take a look at these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:45.320
examples tomorrow my plane leaves at 700 a.m.&nbsp;
classes start next week at 9:00 a.m. so notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:51.640
with these that when we use the present simple to&nbsp;
talk about future actions it's for things which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:57.640
follow a schedule so anything that follows a&nbsp;
timetable or a schedule of some kind you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:05.160
use the present simple for example Transportation&nbsp;
like train times flights Etc you can use it for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:12.800
Cinema times for TV times things like that like&nbsp;
TV programs all of these follow a schedule or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:19.240
you could use it for courses like the classes&nbsp;
start at 9:00 a.m. they follow a timetable I'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:24.400
like you to look at these sentences and decide&nbsp;
whether we should use the present simple or the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:30.320
present continuous in the gaps remember you can&nbsp;
pause the video if you need more time number

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:40.800
one Susan is not visiting us tomorrow&nbsp;
or Susan isn't visiting us tomorrow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.240
so this is a concrete plan she's&nbsp;
not visiting us tomorrow number

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:56.640
two the meeting starts at 10:00 tomorrow&nbsp;
morning the meeting starts because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.680
a sh scheduled thing it's a scheduled event number

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:11.560
three I'm afraid I can't help you tomorrow I&nbsp;
am visiting my grandparents or I'm visiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:18.720
my grandparents we use the present continuous&nbsp;
because this is a concrete 100% plan number

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:29.280
four the train leaves at 6:00 p.m. the train&nbsp;
leaves because this this train follows a timetable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:35.640
it follows a schedule so we use the present simple&nbsp;
and that is the end of today's English grammar&nbsp;&nbsp;
