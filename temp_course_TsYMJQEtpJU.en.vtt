00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome to this beginner&nbsp;
English grammar master class.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.560
This master class will help you learn&nbsp;
essential grammar that you need as a beginner.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.600
Now, even if you're an intermediate or&nbsp;
advanced student, pay close attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.040
because I hear mistakes with all of&nbsp;
these areas from all my students.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.200
Of course, I'm Jennifer from JForrest English.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.760
Now let's get started.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.960
First, let's review how to use do, does, and did.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.080
Well, you need to understand that all three of&nbsp;
these are just different forms of the verb to do.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.440
So the verb to do is the infinitive.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.480
Now do and does are the present&nbsp;
simple conjugations of the verb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.720
and you simply choose one or the other&nbsp;
based on the subject that you have.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.920
So if you're forming a&nbsp;
sentence and your subject is I,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:10.200
you, we or they, you need to choose&nbsp;
do if your subject is ** *** or it.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.840
So third person singular, you&nbsp;
need to choose does and that's it.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.920
That's the only difference between do or does&nbsp;
in affirmative sentences in the present simple.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.880
But keep in mind that do as a verb is used in&nbsp;
very specific sentences in the present simple.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.880
So, for example, you do chores, you do chores.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.680
The verb do is what we need&nbsp;
to complete the sentence.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.560
So I could say I do chores every Sunday.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.960
This is a routine.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.120
It's in the present simple because&nbsp;
my subject is I, then I need do.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.200
Now you can also do homework.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.600
For example, do is the verb&nbsp;
that we use with homework.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.360
Now I could say my sister, which&nbsp;
of course is she as a subject.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.760
My sister does homework every night.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.360
Again, this is a routine, so&nbsp;
I need the present simple.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.920
My subject is my sister she, so I need does.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.200
Now let's talk about did.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.960
Did is the past simple form of the verb to do.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.760
And as a past simple verb, there's&nbsp;
no difference with subjects.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.040
So you use DID for all subjects&nbsp;
so that one is easier to remember.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.320
And of course, if it's the past simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.200
then we just need to make sure that&nbsp;
our time reference is in the past.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:02.560
So I could say we did our homework last&nbsp;
night, she did her homework this morning.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.880
Assuming this morning is already in the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.960
because right now is this&nbsp;
afternoon or this evening.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.000
So this morning is in the past.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.520
She did her homework this morning.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.200
So notice it doesn't matter if I use we or she.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.240
The subject doesn't matter because&nbsp;
DID is used for all subjects.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.080
You just need to make sure that your&nbsp;
time reference is a past time reference.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.360
Where do and does your time reference&nbsp;
is going to be a routine action.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.160
So you're going to hear time&nbsp;
references like always, usually every.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.200
Then you know it's a present simple amazing job.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.840
Now let's review was and were.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:00.200
Now, of course, both was and were are the past&nbsp;
forms of the verb to be and we use was and were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.640
in different grammatical structures.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.840
In English, the most common time&nbsp;
you'll see was or were is in the past.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.720
Simple.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.200
So let's just take a present statement.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.960
Let's use to be late.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.240
So here we have the verb to be to be late.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.680
Now if I wanna make a sentence in&nbsp;
the past, for example, yesterday,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:35.080
yesterday I now I take my verb to be and&nbsp;
I need to conjugate this in the past.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.120
There are two different choices, was or were.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.920
Your choice depends on the subject.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.080
So in order to know which one you need was or&nbsp;
were, you simply look at your subject yesterday.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:01.640
I the subject is I Yesterday I was&nbsp;
late, yesterday I was late yesterday.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:10.040
You, you were yesterday, you were late yesterday.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.240
She was late yesterday he was late.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.360
It was late.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.120
So notice ** *** it.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.440
Those are our three options for&nbsp;
the third person singular subject.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.760
The third person singular is conjugated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:40.440
with was yesterday we we were late,&nbsp;
and yesterday they they were late.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.760
So you can see that the subjects&nbsp;
I and third person singular use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.480
was this subjects you, we and they use were.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.560
That's what you need to remember.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.280
So pause the video now.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.680
Take as much time as you need to memorize this.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.600
You simply need to memorize this.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.400
Now the same rule applies&nbsp;
when we use the verb to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.600
in the past in different grammatical structures.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.960
So this example was using the past simple.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.720
Now we also use the verb to be in&nbsp;
the past with the past continuous.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.560
The past continuous is formed with subject was or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:39.680
were your choice depends on your subject&nbsp;
right and then your verb in ING form.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.680
I could say yesterday I was running late.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.560
We we were we were running late.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.600
He he was running late.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.880
They they were running late.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.000
So it's the same rules that we just covered.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
That doesn't change even though we're using&nbsp;
a different grammatical structure this time.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.200
It's the past continuous.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.520
Now we also use the verb to be in the past.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.640
So was or were depending on the&nbsp;
subject in the passive voice.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.120
So let's take an active sentence and I could say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.760
the present surprised mean&nbsp;
the present surprised me.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.160
Now I can take this active voice&nbsp;
and I can turn it into the passive.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.800
And I would say, what will you guys tell me?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.280
I'm going to give you a second and I&nbsp;
want you to write it in the comments.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.760
What's the passive form of this active sentence?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.800
Hmm, Write it in the comments.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.120
So did you get it?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.560
I was surprised.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.520
I was surprised by the present.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.320
I was surprised by this present.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:13.400
But now let's say the active form used a&nbsp;
different pronoun and it was the present.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.720
Surprised US.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.080
OK, what would that be now&nbsp;
the present surprised us.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.840
What would that be in the passive form?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.640
So you guys tell me write it down in the comments.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.400
The present surprised us.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.440
What would that be in the passive voice?

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.040
That would be we.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.720
We is now the subject.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.000
So I need to think do I need was or were?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.320
Well, remember it depends on&nbsp;
the subject we we use were.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.920
We were surprised by the present.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.920
To summarize, the choice between&nbsp;
was or were depends on the subject&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:03.960
we use was with the subjects I or&nbsp;
third person singular ** *** it.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.560
We use were with subjects you, we and they,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.160
and was and where are used in&nbsp;
the past form of the verb to be.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:20.760
This is most commonly found in the past&nbsp;
simple, past, continuous and passive voice.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.920

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.320
Now let's continue with our lesson.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:06.240
Let's keep going and learn the&nbsp;
difference between do you and are you.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.160
Both of these are question&nbsp;
forms in the present simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.040
but they use different verbs&nbsp;
and different structures.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:22.120
So let's begin with are you Now&nbsp;
are, of course, is the verb to be.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:31.920
So are you is forming a question in the present&nbsp;
simple, using the verb to be our subject is you.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:39.840
So that's why we need are because that's the&nbsp;
conjugated verb to be with our subject you.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.920
Now we use the verb to be in&nbsp;
the present simple for facts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.640
facts about the world or&nbsp;
facts about ourselves as well.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.600
For example, I could ask you&nbsp;
because remember this is a question.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.520
So you're going to ask someone about a fact.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.000
So I could ask you, are you American or British?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.520
Are you, are you American or British?

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.080
Now another fact would be your job.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.960
So I can ask you, are you a software engineer?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.320
Now I could also ask you a fact&nbsp;
about your physical description&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.400
and I could ask you, for example, are you tall?

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.000
Assuming we're chatting and I can't see you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.240
so I don't know if you're tall or&nbsp;
not, and I could ask, are you tall?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.680
Now let's take a look at the sentence structure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:39.080
because using the verb to be in question&nbsp;
form, we use something called inversion.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:46.320
So we take our subject and our verb, which&nbsp;
would be the structure for a positive sentence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.320
and we invert them, which means we switch them.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.440
So our sentence structure for questions using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:00.440
verb to be in the present simple&nbsp;
is verb plus subject plus object.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.840
So we know our verb is the verb to be are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:10.240
and we know our subject is you&nbsp;
because we're only talking about are.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.880
So our subject and our verb&nbsp;
need to conjugate are you.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.920
And then I just need my object, the question,&nbsp;
the rest of the sentence, are you tall?

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:27.120
Now keep that sentence structure in&nbsp;
mind while we take a look at do you.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.400
Do you is also a question&nbsp;
form in the present simple.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:41.760
The difference is do is an auxiliary verb, which&nbsp;
means do doesn't have any meaning in that word.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.600
It's only there grammatically.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.360
So to have meaning in the&nbsp;
sentence, we need a main verb.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.640
Do is the auxiliary verb, and&nbsp;
we still need a main verb.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:01.600
Now in the present simple, I'm going to ask&nbsp;
you about yourself or about your routine.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.760
So for example, I could ask do you live in London?

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:18.400
So of course here live is our main verb, but I&nbsp;
need my auxiliary verb do do you live in London?

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.400
I can't just do inversion&nbsp;
with my subject and verb.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.960
If I did that, it would be live&nbsp;
you in London, live you in London.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.480
And we know that isn't grammatically&nbsp;
correct for English sentence structure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:42.120
so we need our auxiliary verb do and&nbsp;
do is conjugated with our subject you.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.520
Do you live in London?

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.200
Another question, do you have a dog?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.120
So here have is our main verb.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.880
But I can't say have you a dog.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.600
So I need do you have a dog?

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.680
I need my auxiliary verb do so&nbsp;
compare our two sentence structures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:14.040
because here our sentence structure&nbsp;
is auxiliary verb, subject main verb.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:21.040
Auxiliary verb is due because our subject&nbsp;
is you and do conjugates with the subject.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.720
You do you.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.840
And now we need a main verb.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:32.080
But the form of this is the base verb,&nbsp;
which means it's the infinitive without two.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:38.040
So to live we get rid of two&nbsp;
and we have live do you live?

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.080
And then the rest of the sentence, the object.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:47.720
So with ru, our sentence structure&nbsp;
was verb, subject object.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:56.040
Do you our sentence structure is&nbsp;
auxiliary verb do subject main verb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.040
which is the base verb and then the object.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.960
They're both used in question&nbsp;
form with the present simple.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.280
And this is something that&nbsp;
you absolutely must know to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.160
understand basic English sentence structure.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.680
So now it's your turn to practice.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:21.200
I want you to leave two questions in the comments&nbsp;
below, one with do you and one with are you.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.840
You're doing so great.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.480
Now let's talk about how to use didn't and wasn't.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:35.800
Both of these are the past simple forms,&nbsp;
and both of them are past simple negative.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:43.200
Wasn't is the past simple&nbsp;
negative form of the verb to be.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:55.240
But wasn't is only used with the subjects I, **&nbsp;
*** and it didn't is a past simple negative form,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:02.240
but it's an auxiliary verb, which means&nbsp;
it doesn't have a base verb itself.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.960
It's used with any base verb.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:12.800
So our sentence structure would be&nbsp;
subject didn't base verb to form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.200
a complete sentence that's past simple negative.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:24.680
To understand both of these, let's start&nbsp;
with a positive sentence in the present.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.080
So we'll do a present simple positive&nbsp;
sentence and then we'll see how we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.320
change that sentence into&nbsp;
the past simple negative.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:39.120
So you can see the transformation&nbsp;
of how we use didn't and wasn't.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:49.280
So let's start with our positive present simple&nbsp;
sentence for the verb to be, I'm there, I'm there.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.680
Pretty simple, right to be there, I'm there.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.800
Or I could say she's there.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:04.000
Now I can make this sentence negative in&nbsp;
the present simple simply by adding not.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.160
I'm not there, she isn't there.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:18.480
But remember wasn't is the form of&nbsp;
the verb to be and it's negative,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.000
but it's used in the past simple.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.560
So I need to take my two sentences&nbsp;
and have a past simple time reference.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.080
So let's use yesterday.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:36.240
Yesterday I know I'm in the past simple and I&nbsp;
know that my sentence is going to be negative.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:46.040
So I can say yesterday she wasn't&nbsp;
there, yesterday I wasn't there.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.040
So that's how the transformation&nbsp;
took place from having a present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:57.680
simple positive to present simple&nbsp;
negative to past simple negative.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:04.560
And remember wasn't is only used&nbsp;
for the subjects I, ** *** it.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:10.000
So let's do the same thing and&nbsp;
see how we can get to didn't.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.440
So let's start with a present&nbsp;
simple positive sentence.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.680
I go to bed at 10:30.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.200
So here my verb is go to go.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.280
I go to bed at 10:30.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.960
Now, when we take regular verbs, excluding&nbsp;
to be, to be as a verb has different rules.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.160
OK, so we take regular verbs like the verb go.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:43.320
We have our positive in the present simple&nbsp;
to form the negative in the present simple.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.840
I need an auxiliary verb.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.560
And that auxiliary verb that&nbsp;
I'm going to use is don't.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.240
I don't go to bed at 10:30.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.920
This is the auxiliary verb for&nbsp;
the subjects I, you, we, and they.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.640
I don't go to bed at 10:30.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.080
So now I have a negative sentence,&nbsp;
but it's in the present simple.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:16.440
It talks about a routine, but I want to talk about&nbsp;
a past simple so I can use the keyword yesterday.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:26.080
So I know I'm in the past simple&nbsp;
Yesterday I didn't go to bed at 10:30.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.040
So to form a negative sentence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:35.560
in the past simple for regular verbs,&nbsp;
we need to follow our structure.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.960
Subject didn't, and then our base verb.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.640
Our base verb is go.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.520
I didn't go to bed at 10:30 yesterday.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.880
So far we have focused on individual verbs.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:59.880
Now let's take a look at the five most common verb&nbsp;
tenses that you need to speak English fluently.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.880
The 1st is the present simple.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.480
For this subjects, I, you, we,&nbsp;
and they, you add the base verb.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:14.280
Now for the subjects ** *** it,&nbsp;
you add the base verb plus S.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.760
Or ES and this is one of the&nbsp;
most common mistakes that my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.560
advanced students make for getting&nbsp;
to add that S so don't forget that.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.640
As for ** *** it subjects the&nbsp;
present simple is used to describe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.160
routine habits in your daily life.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:39.120
For example, I eat breakfast every day at 6:00 AM.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.800
It's also used to describe&nbsp;
general facts and truths.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:50.320
For example, the sun rises in&nbsp;
the east and sets in the West.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.560
And notice I added those s s&nbsp;
because the sun is it, ** *** it.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.640
You need those s s.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.840
It's also used for feelings,&nbsp;
emotions, and states of beings.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.440
We are very excited for the concert tonight.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.720
Now here's one that most of my&nbsp;
students don't use correctly.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:21.160
And the present simple is also used for timetable&nbsp;
events, even if that event is in the future.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:27.000
For example, the train leaves at 5:00 AM tomorrow.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.280
It's very common to use an adverb of&nbsp;
frequency with the present simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.960
which is one easy way that you can identify it.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:44.640
The most common adverbs of frequency are every&nbsp;
day or always for seven times a week, often,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:52.640
usually, or frequently for about four to six times&nbsp;
a week, sometimes for three to four times a week,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:59.840
rarely or seldom for one to two times a&nbsp;
week, and never for zero times a week.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.400
So let's practice this just for fun.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:09.560
Share something silly that you never&nbsp;
do or always do in the comments below.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:16.440
For example, I never brush&nbsp;
my teeth while I'm driving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.560
so share something silly in the&nbsp;
comments just to have a little fun.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.520
Now let's move on to the past&nbsp;
simple to form the past simple.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:32.600
You have your subject and then you have your base&nbsp;
verb plus Ed or an irregular past simple verb.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.760
And there are many irregular verbs,&nbsp;
so you simply need to memorize them.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:46.480
The past simple is used for an action that started&nbsp;
and finished at a specific time in the past.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.200
For example, I went to the store yesterday,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:58.640
she took a shower at 8:00 AM, but now it&nbsp;
is 11:00 AM, so 8:00 AM is in the past.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:05.680
They ordered pizza for dinner and now it's&nbsp;
10:00 at night, so dinner is in the past.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.720
We sang all night, but I'm talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.720
maybe yesterday or the night&nbsp;
before, so it's in the past.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.280
Let's review some past simple keywords so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.840
can easily identify when you&nbsp;
need to use this verb tense.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.280
Yesterday, last week, month, or year?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.360
In 2020 at 3:30 PM.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:38.320
Four hours ago on Monday, on July 15th&nbsp;
when I graduated or during the meeting.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.640
And remember all of those keywords?

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.160
The actions started and finished in the past.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.400
Now let's talk about the future.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.400
Simple, another verb tense.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.800
I see a lot of mistakes with.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.720
The structure is very easy.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.080
You have your struct, subject, will and base verb.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.200
It's the same for all&nbsp;
subjects, which makes it easy.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:10.240
This verb tense is used to make predictions,&nbsp;
but when it's based on your opinion, not facts.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.840
Argentina will win the World Cup.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.960
This is just my opinion, I&nbsp;
don't know this as a fact.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.560
Someone else could say I think&nbsp;
France will win the World Cup.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.040
Notice here I added.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.920
I think it's very common to use&nbsp;
an opinion word with the future.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.840
Simple.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.960
This verb tense is used for&nbsp;
spontaneous actions or decisions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.800
which means they were not planned in advance.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.960
For example, let's say you see a woman struggling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.640
with her grocery bags and&nbsp;
she has many grocery bags.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.920
You can say I'll help you with those bags.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.680
You didn't plan this in advance,&nbsp;
it was a spontaneous action.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:25:00.640
It's also used with promises,&nbsp;
commitments, offers, or refusals.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:08.680
If you say I'll send you the report at 5:00&nbsp;
PM, you are making a promise or a commitment.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.520
It's like saying I promise I'll send you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.600
the report at 5:00 PM so the&nbsp;
other person will expect it.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.000
If you use the future.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.920
Simple.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.960
Now let's talk about the present.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.520
Perfect.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.720
A verb tense that confuses a lot of students.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.840
But absolutely, you must know how to use it.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:34.880
The structure is I, you, we,&nbsp;
they plus have plus the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.800
participle and you simply need to&nbsp;
memorize all the past participles.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.320
Now for the subjects ** ***&nbsp;
is, you need to use has as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.000
your auxiliary verb and the past participle.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.240
Now, did you know that the present perfect&nbsp;
is also used with the completed past action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.280
but one that has a result or&nbsp;
consequence in the present?

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.120
For example, I have eaten that&nbsp;
is a completed past action.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.000
Now it's common to use&nbsp;
already, but it's not required.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.320
I have already eaten, so what's&nbsp;
the result in the present?

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.680
So now I'm not hungry.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.640
It's also used for life experience&nbsp;
when it's an unfinished timeline.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:33.120
For example, she's been to Panama twice now&nbsp;
because she is alive, she can go to Panama again.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.520
So it's an unfinished time reference.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.720
Or you could say I haven't seen that movie yet.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:47.360
Yet is a keyword for the present perfect&nbsp;
and we use it in negative sentences.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.240
And by saying yet you're letting the person know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.320
that is still possible for you to&nbsp;
watch that movie in the future.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.600
So it's an unfinished time reference now.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:04.120
The present perfect is also used for an action&nbsp;
that started in the past and continues until now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.040
but only with three common&nbsp;
verbs, live, work, and study.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.520
For example, they've lived&nbsp;
in that house for 20 years.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.880
They still live there now,&nbsp;
and it started in the past.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.760
It started 20 years ago.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.560
Very important point.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:28.320
You can't use a specific time&nbsp;
reference with the present perfect.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.320
You must use the past.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.120
Simple.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.480
This is a very common mistake&nbsp;
that I see my students make.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:41.520
So you can't say I've tried&nbsp;
sushi last week because last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.080
week is a specific past time reference.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.120
So you would have to say I tried sushi last week,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.040
or you could get rid of last&nbsp;
week and say I've tried sushi.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:00.080
Let's move on to our last verb&nbsp;
tense, the present continuous.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.800
This structure is I am plus verb in your ING form,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:13.800
your gerund verb you we they&nbsp;
are plus verb in ING or ** ***.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.200
It is plus verb in ING.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:23.360
So don't forget you have to conjugate&nbsp;
the verb to be according to the subject.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:31.400
The present continuous is used for an action&nbsp;
that is currently taking place right now now.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:36.480
So I could say my students are&nbsp;
because the subject is they.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.960
My students are watching&nbsp;
my video right now, right?

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.760
You're watching this video right now.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.840
You can also use the present&nbsp;
continuous with the future.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.120
If it's a planned action, a&nbsp;
planned action in the future.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.760
For example, he's attending&nbsp;
the conference next month.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.800
It's in the future, but it's planned.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.160
He's attending the conference next month.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:13.920
Or she's performing at the World Cup in&nbsp;
2026, so even though it's way in the future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.000
you can still use the present&nbsp;
continuous if it's a planned event.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.880
An important note that you should know&nbsp;
because I know it might confuse students.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.480
Native speakers use the&nbsp;
present continuous with always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.360
to stress the continuation of something negative.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.440
She is always coming to work late.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.920
So instead of saying she always comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.040
to work late because always is a&nbsp;
keyword for the present simple.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.240
Native speakers frequently put&nbsp;
this in the present continuous.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.240
I don't recommend that you do&nbsp;
that because it really depends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.280
on the context if it sounds correct or incorrect.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.160
But grammatically, it's always correct&nbsp;
to use the present simple with always.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.160
So that's what I recommend that you do.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.680
I'm just sharing this so you don't get confused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:14.120
when you hear a native speaker say&nbsp;
she is always coming to work late.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:20.480
Now you know the five verb tenses&nbsp;
that make up 96% of your speech.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.240
So Are you ready for your quiz?

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.880
To make sure you really know how to&nbsp;
use them, here are the questions.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.640
Hit pause and take as much time as you need.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:37.320
And when you're ready to continue, hit play.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.360
Here are the answers.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.080
Hit pause.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:46.840
Review the answers, and when&nbsp;
you're ready to continue, hit play.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.000
Now that you have an overview of&nbsp;
these verb tenses, let's look in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.280
more detail at the difference between&nbsp;
the past simple and the present perfect.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.200
So we use the past simple with&nbsp;
the completed past action, right?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.080
This action is complete.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.960
I already ate.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.120
That is a finished completed action in the past.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.720
Now let's talk about the present perfect.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.160
Here's what you need to keep in mind.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:22.160
The present perfect has a many&nbsp;
different uses depending on the context.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:28.880
In this lesson, we're specifically talking&nbsp;
about comparing these two sentences.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.600
So in this specific context,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:39.800
the present perfect can be used for a&nbsp;
past action with a present consequence.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.400
OK, there are other ways&nbsp;
we use the present perfect.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.560
We're not going to discuss those.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:53.840
We're specifically talking about this one,&nbsp;
meaning a past action with a present consequence.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.960
I've already eaten.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.160
So as you can see just from their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:04.880
definitions that they can both be&nbsp;
used with a completed past action.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.560
The difference is the present perfect present.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.680
There is a connection to the present.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.800
OK, so keep that as your memory aid.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.640
Present perfect present, connection&nbsp;
to the present with the past.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.240
Simple that connection to the present isn't there.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:30.720
One other thing you need to keep in mind is that&nbsp;
a native English speaker is not a grammar expert.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:37.920
A native English speaker is going to use&nbsp;
these two sentences in this specific context.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.760
They're going to use these&nbsp;
two sentences interchangeably,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.760
and there's not going to&nbsp;
be a difference in meaning.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:52.200
So when a native speaker says I already ate or&nbsp;
I've already eaten, there's no difference at all.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.200
If you ask them why did you&nbsp;
say this one and not this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.440
they're not going to know because&nbsp;
they don't study grammar, okay?

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.320
And they're both acceptable.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.200
So just keep that in mind.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:10.040
A native speaker is going to use them&nbsp;
interchangeably with no difference in meaning.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.120
But let's talk about that&nbsp;
subtle difference in meaning.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:18.240
When we say that the present perfect&nbsp;
can be used with a past action that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.960
has a present consequence, what does that mean?

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.960
A present consequence.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.560
So let's just think about that.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.280
I already ate in the past.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.320
Simple, just remember, completed past action.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.000
It's done, it's over.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.440
I already ate.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:38.560
Now when I say I've already eaten, there's&nbsp;
some sort of connection to the present.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.760
So you can always think of it in&nbsp;
your head as I've already eaten.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.040
So now, OK, I've already eaten.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.960
So now because connection to&nbsp;
the present, I've already eaten.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.880
So now I'm not hungry.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.400
So now I don't want a piece of cake.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:07.520
So now I don't want to go to that&nbsp;
restaurant with you, OK, I've already eaten.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.040
But keep in mind that.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.480
So now we don't verbalize&nbsp;
it, We don't say it out loud.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.080
It's just implied in the context.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.080
OK, so let's take a look at a few more examples.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.840
I could say I talked to my boss,&nbsp;
just a completed past action.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.160
Or I could say I've talked to my boss.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.360
So what's the connection to the present?

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.400
Maybe I've talked to my boss.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.840
So now I'm going to leave.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.840
Maybe that's just the connection to the present.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.120
It could be anything.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.720
Again, we don't verbalize that.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.520
It's just imply.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.800
How about this one?

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.920
I checked the mail, I just completed past action.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.440
I checked the mail.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.440
Or I've checked the mail in the present perfect.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.200
I've checked the mail.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.640
What's the connection to the present?

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.840
I've checked the mail so you don't have to.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.480
That could be the connection to the present.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.040
One more example, I booked the&nbsp;
hotel, completed past action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.960
or I could say I've booked&nbsp;
the hotel in the present.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.040
Perfect.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.880
I've booked the hotel.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.520
So now we're going on vacation.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.760
Maybe that's the connection to the present.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.000
So now I'm excited.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.480
Remember, we don't specifically&nbsp;
say it is just implied.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:35.480
And also in all of these examples in this&nbsp;
specific context, a native English speaker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:41.520
is going to use them interchangeably&nbsp;
without a difference in meaning.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.560
Amazing job.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:49.240
Now let's look closer at the difference between&nbsp;
the present simple and the present continuous.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.160
This is a mistake that I see&nbsp;
students making quite a lot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.440
and this is a mistake that I&nbsp;
see my advanced students make.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:04.760
Now you need to keep in mind that when you use&nbsp;
a different verb tense, the meaning changes.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:10.600
So when I hear I live in&nbsp;
Paris in the present simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:17.520
that is different from I'm living&nbsp;
in Paris, the meaning is different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:24.280
and I'm going to interpret them differently&nbsp;
simply because of the verb tense you used.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.600
Now our present simple, I live in Paris.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.160
Of course, to form the present simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.200
we just take our base verb, which&nbsp;
is the infinitive without two.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.840
Remember, we need to conjugate&nbsp;
this with our subject.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:42.320
So if it was she, it would be she lives in Paris.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.440
OK, Now we use the present simple&nbsp;
for routines like I'm sure you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:53.240
but we also use the present simple when&nbsp;
we're talking about permanent situations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.280
or you can think of them as simply facts.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:05.120
So when I hear someone say I live in&nbsp;
Paris, I see this as a permanent situation.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.200
I live in Paris.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:12.520
I live in Paris today, and I'm going to&nbsp;
be living in Paris for the future as well.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.200
It's a permanent situation.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.760
Now let's take a look at our next sentence.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.080
I'm living in Paris.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.640
So this is in the present continuous.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:29.040
Now, of course, we form the present continuous&nbsp;
with the verb to be conjugated with our subject.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.960
So I'm living.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:39.080
She is She's living conjugated with our&nbsp;
subject, and then we need our verb in ING form.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.920
She's living, I'm living now.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:49.280
We use the present continuous for&nbsp;
situations taking place right now, right?

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.640
But we also use the present&nbsp;
continuous for temporary situations.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:03.600
So when I hear I'm living in Paris, I&nbsp;
think of this as a temporary situation.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.360
So I think you're living in Paris right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.560
but you don't expect to be&nbsp;
living in Paris in the future.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.480
When in the future?

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.600
Well, that isn't clear.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:22.120
But when I hear it, I think of&nbsp;
it as a temporary situation.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:30.720
And this is a big difference if you live in Paris&nbsp;
permanently or you live in Paris temporarily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:38.640
right, 'cause you can imagine if you go to a job&nbsp;
interview and then you say to the interviewer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:46.360
I'm living in Paris, well, they might not think&nbsp;
that you're going to be in the city for very long.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.840
So they might not consider you as an&nbsp;
applicant because they want somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.440
who's going to be in the position for a long time.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.960
But you are only going to be&nbsp;
in the city temporarily, right?

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.280
So that could have a really big impact.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:09.680
Or same thing if you're on a date and you're&nbsp;
talking to a potential romantic partner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.640
but you say I'm living in Paris,&nbsp;
well, they might think, well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:20.600
it's not worthwhile to pursue this relationship&nbsp;
because she's going to be moving in the future.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.440
So there's a big difference in&nbsp;
meaning between these two sentences.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:31.560
So keep in mind, we use the present&nbsp;
symbol for a permanent situation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.040
the present continuous for a temporary situation.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.560
So now it's your turn to practice.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:45.200
I want you to put in the comments one sentence in&nbsp;
the present, simple, that's a permanent situation.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.680
And one sentence in the present&nbsp;
continuous, that's a temporary situation.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.920
We're doing such a great job.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.240
Think of everything you learned.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.040
Now let's review the difference&nbsp;
between 4:00 and sense.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.160
Now there's a specific time that you&nbsp;
need to choose either for or sense.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.280
They're not interchangeable, and it will make your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.000
sentence grammatically incorrect&nbsp;
if you're using the wrong one.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.080
So first let's talk about four.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.080
We use 4 for duration.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.480
Okay, so you can think of it&nbsp;
as a time that has a start and.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.320
An end a duration of time, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:38.000
for 20 minutes, for three weeks, for&nbsp;
seven months, or how about for 12 years?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:48.760
Now we use sense with a specific time, so you&nbsp;
can think of it as a precise moment in time.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:57.240
For example 9:00 AM last Monday, June 3rd, 2014.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.000
So that's the first thing you need&nbsp;
to know to use these correctly.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.480
4 is a duration of time, and&nbsp;
since is a specific time.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.080
Now let's talk about the verb&nbsp;
tenses that you need for each.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.880
So here's a little quiz for you.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:23.640
I'm going to show you some sentences&nbsp;
using 4IN different verb tenses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:30.520
and I want you to tell me which ones are&nbsp;
correct and which ones are incorrect.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.760
And keep in mind we're talking&nbsp;
about the verb tense specifically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.800
so that's what you need to look at.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:57.240
So I'll show you the example sentences now.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.960
So which ones are correct&nbsp;
and which ones are incorrect?

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.520
Let us know in the comments.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:14.760
Well, I hate to break it to you, but this was&nbsp;
a trick question because they're all correct.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.640
And the point is that four can be&nbsp;
used with many different verbatimses.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.920
It's quite diverse in that way.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.600
Now let's do the same thing,&nbsp;
but this time we'll do it with.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:34.640
Since so again, the time references are all&nbsp;
correct, I'm using them all with specific time.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.000
But let's take a look at the verb tenses.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:57.120
So I'll show you the sentences and I want you to&nbsp;
let us know which ones are correct and incorrect.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.960
So how'd you do with this one?

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.000
How about in the comments let&nbsp;
us know which ones are correct?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
OK, put it in the comments.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.040
Now this one wasn't a trick question&nbsp;
because sense is a lot more limited.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.520
So here are example sentences.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.560
The only correct ones were number one and #3&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:35.520
You can use sense with the present perfect&nbsp;
and the present perfect continuous.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:45.600
The reason why is because since we use this for&nbsp;
an action that started in the past but continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:54.000
until now, and we actually don't know when that&nbsp;
action is going to end, but it's important.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.680
It started it in the past, continues&nbsp;
till now and is still built in progress.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.720
That's when we can use sense.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:10.440
All right, so now you know that four is used&nbsp;
for a duration of time and it's very diverse.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.280
You can use it with many different verb tenses.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:20.360
You know that since we need a&nbsp;
specific time and you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.400
it with the present perfect and&nbsp;
the present perfect continuous.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:31.840
Now let me show you a sentence that I&nbsp;
see almost every day and it's wrong.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:39.160
And the sentence is I've been&nbsp;
learning English since two years.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.440
All right, this sentence is wrong.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:49.440
Now, I want you to take this sentence&nbsp;
and make it a correct sentence.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:55.760
You're going to need to change either&nbsp;
the for or since or the time reference.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:01.800
OK, so make your change and put the&nbsp;
correct sentence in the comments below.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.840
Amazing, John.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:09.680
Now let's talk about if you&nbsp;
need you and me or you and I.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.000
Now the easiest, the absolute&nbsp;
easiest way to know which one you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:23.520
need to use is always drop the you&nbsp;
or drop the other person involved.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:31.320
And just ask yourself in this&nbsp;
sentence, do I need me or I?

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.600
Because when you answer that&nbsp;
question in every scenario,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:41.800
all you need to do is then add in&nbsp;
the you and it will be correct.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:46.040
So let's take an example of this&nbsp;
and I'll show you what I mean.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:51.240
For example, give that to, give that to.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.320
I give that to me.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.880
What do you guys think?

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.600
I or me put it in the comments below.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.040
Give that to I give that to me.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.320
Hmm, it would be, of course, me.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.160
Give that to me.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.320
So now all you need to add is another person.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.680
You could say, give that to my&nbsp;
brother and me, for example.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.160
Give that to my brother and me.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.120
So it doesn't matter who you add after.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.680
Let's try another example.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:28.680
Let's say you're walking down the street and you&nbsp;
see this beautiful garden and you ask a stranger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:37.840
you say, can you take a picture of&nbsp;
Can you take a picture of I or of me?

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.800
Can you take a picture of I?

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.840
Can you take a picture of me?

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.080
Which one do you think?

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.360
Put it in the comments below.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.200
Can you take a picture of me?

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.800
So now you just add, can you take&nbsp;
a picture of my friend and me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.440
My friend and me, my friends and me.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.400
It doesn't really matter what you put in.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.600
So let's try another example.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.640
Went to the party.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.360
Went to the party.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.880
So is this me?

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.920
Went to the party or I went to the party?

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.720
What do you think?

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.800
Put it in the comments.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.720
Of course it's I went to the party.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:26.360
So all we need to do is add in my friends&nbsp;
and I, you and I went to the party.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:32.200
Doesn't matter what you put&nbsp;
before I so one more example.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.240
Ran a marathon.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.760
I ran a marathon, me ran a marathon.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.800
What do you think?

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.040
Put it in the comments.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.720
I ran a marathon.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.560
So now I know it's I so I can&nbsp;
just add you and I ran a marathon.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:56.240
My friends and I, my husband and I, my&nbsp;
boss and I doesn't matter what you put in.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.640
My sister and I, it doesn't matter.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:05.680
So that's the easiest way for you to&nbsp;
know if you need you and me or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.680
and I just drop the you or drop the my friends.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:17.880
Drop the whoever it is, my coworkers, and just&nbsp;
ask yourself, do I need me or I in this sentence?

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:25.320
Now if you're not sure if you need me or I,&nbsp;
you just have to remember this one thing.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:35.520
I is always the subject of a sentence, the&nbsp;
subject of a sentence, OK, and what's me?

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.960
Me is the object of a sentence.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:49.440
So just to quickly study this topic, let's go back&nbsp;
to our example of Can you take a picture of me?

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.480
Can you take a picture of my friends and me?

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.360
Hmm.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.720
OK, so who's the subject in this sentence?

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.880
Can you?

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.320
So you are the subject in this sentence.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:08.280
You are doing the action,&nbsp;
I am receiving the action.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.160
I'm the object in this sentence.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.680
Can you take a picture of me?

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.040
So I'm not doing the action right.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:25.480
So the subject is the one doing the action,&nbsp;
the object is the one receiving the action.

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:30.640
So that's just a quick overview, but that&nbsp;
is how you the easiest way to tell if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:36.800
need you and me or you and I think of&nbsp;
how much you've already improved your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:44.040
grammar and how many mistakes you've probably&nbsp;
improved just by watching this master class.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:50.200
Now let's talk about irregular verbs&nbsp;
because there are so many in English.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.920
To get you started, here are the&nbsp;
50 most common irregular verbs.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.760
The first verb is the most common verb in English.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:05.840
The verb to be to be, was or were, been.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.640
Notice for the past simple.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:11.320
We have two choices, was or were.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.680
Your choice depends on the subject.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.400
I, ** ***.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.880
It was Yesterday I was sick.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.880
Yesterday he was sick.

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.400
Were is for you.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.200
We and they.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.920
We were sick yesterday.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.520
They were sick yesterday.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.440
The participle bin.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.760
I haven't been sick in years.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:41.560
Become became become.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.520
Yesterday I became sick.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.240
Have you become sick?

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.480
Begin began, begun.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.640
I began the project 2 weeks ago.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.640
Have you begun the project yet?

00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.120
Bring, brought, brought.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.640
She brought chocolates to the party.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:08.680
She had already brought the&nbsp;
chocolates by the time I came.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.840
Buy, bought, bought.

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.760
She bought new shoes last week.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.120
She had bought the shoes&nbsp;
before she got the promotion.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.080
Choose, chose, chosen.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.760
Notice the pronunciation difference&nbsp;
between our base verb choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:36.720
and the past and the participle choose&nbsp;
chose oh, oh, choose chose chosen.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:43.280
She chose me for her team&nbsp;
who had chosen that book.

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.600

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.240
She came home late.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.200

Do.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.480

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.440

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.600

Drink.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.240
Drank.

Drunk.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.240
She drank the entire bottle.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.200
She's drunk 2 bottles so far.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.760
Drive.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.440
Drove.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.120
Driven.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.520
Who drove you here?

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:19.000
I was driven by my friend.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.880

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.920
Fall Fell.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.960
Fallen.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.120
She fell really hard.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.840
She had fallen before it rained.

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.760
Feel.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.560
Felt.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.880
Felt.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.480
I felt bad.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.720
I haven't felt fabric like that before.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.560

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.680
I found 10 bucks on the street.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.080
Have you ever found money before?

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.080
Fly flew, Flown.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.520
They flew to Paris last week.

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.440
I've flown five times this year.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:06.160
Forget, forgot, forgotten.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.320
Oh no, I forgot to buy milk.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.760
Have you ever forgotten someone's birthday?

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.080
Get, got, got, or gotten.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:21.120
You can use either one in&nbsp;
the past participle form.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.800
Got or gotten.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:28.440
Gotten is more common in American English.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.240
Yesterday I got a speeding ticket.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.360
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.320

Go, went, gone.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:56.440
Such a common verb, but I hear a lot of&nbsp;
mistakes with the verb go, go, went, gone.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.200

The politician kept his promise.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.480

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:35.360

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.640

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.080

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.600
Have you ever lent anyone money?

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.840
Let let let.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.480
That one's easy.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.480
She let me keep the money.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:14.760

They made a terrible mistake.

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.360
Have you ever made a promise that you didn't keep?

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.280
Meet, Met.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.200

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.320
We met last week.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.160

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:15.800

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.360
She sat down and broke the chair.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.800
Have you ever sat beside someone famous?

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.640

Who spoke at the wedding?

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.720
I haven't spoken to her in years.

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.560

Have you ever been stood up?

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:56.120
When someone stands you up, it means you made&nbsp;
plans with someone, usually romantically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:01.640
like a date, but the other person didn't show up.

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:06.360
They didn't come to the restaurant&nbsp;
at 7:00 like they said they would.

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:12.200
So have you ever been stood up or&nbsp;
have you ever stood someone up?

I swam in the ocean last week.

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.920
I haven't swum in the ocean for five years.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.920

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:43.640
Have you ever taught someone&nbsp;
how to use irregular verbs?

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.120
Tell, told, told.

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.960
She told me the truth.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.440
Have you ever told a lie?

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.960
Think, thought.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960
Thought.

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.040
I thought it was a good idea.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.680
Have you thought about moving?

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.480
Understand.

She hasn't worn her blue dress yet.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.720
Write, wrote, written.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.840
I wrote the answer in my notebook.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.200
Have you written the essay yet?

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.120
