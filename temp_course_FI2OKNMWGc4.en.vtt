00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.440
Hi everybody.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.120
Welcome to Beginner 1.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.200
In these videos, I hope to&nbsp;
teach you some basic English.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.280
So, these videos are for low level beginners.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.880
Okay…

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.120
Now when you watch these videos,
I want you to pay attention.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.840
Okay…

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.720
Watch all the videos in the series.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.520
Okay…

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.080
Please listen carefully and if there are any
words or expressions that you don’t know,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.680
please check your dictionary.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.840
Another thing you should do is repeat after me.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.040
Repeating is a really good practice.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.360
Okay…

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.920
So, I know that some of these videos are hard.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.760
But please don’t give up.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.400
If you try your best, and watch all of these
videos,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.560
I know that your English will get better.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.960
Okay, well let’s get started.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.000
Hi, everybody and welcome to this video.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.560
Now in this video, I want to talk about the
difference between consonants and vowels.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.080
Now, in the English alphabet,&nbsp;
there are twenty-six letters.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.360
And in the alphabet, there are five main vowels
and one special vowel.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.560
And the rest are consonants.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.880
So, let’s look at the board.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.960
Here’s the alphabet.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.200
The first letter, ‘a’, is a vowel.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.880
The next letter, ‘b’, is a consonant.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.160
‘c’ is a consonant.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.680
‘d’ consonant.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.080
‘e’ is a vowel.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.000
Then, ‘f’, is a consonant.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.560
‘g’ consonant.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.720
‘h’ consonant.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.400
‘i’ is another vowel.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.920
‘j’ is a consonant.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.400
‘k’ consonant.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.120
‘l’, ‘m’, ‘n’ are consonants.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.240
‘o’ is another vowel.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.080
‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, ’s’ and ‘t’,
these are all consonants.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.560
‘u’ is the last main vowel.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.840
‘v’ consonant.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.840
‘w’ consonant.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.160
‘x’ consonant.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.160
‘y’ is the special vowel.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.320
And we’ll talk about that more later on.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.880
And ‘z’ is the last letter,
and it is a consonant.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.920
Okay, so, there are twenty-six&nbsp;
letters in the alphabet.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.800
There are five main vowels.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.040
One special vowel.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.920
And the rest are consonant.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.320
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.280
Let’s look at some words.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.480
Now all English words have vowels.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.200
Maybe one or many vowels.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.800
So, let’s look at these words.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.280
The first word is “cat”.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.480
Okay, we have ‘c’ is a consonant.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.240
‘a’ a vowel.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.320
‘t’ consonant.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.080
“Egg”.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.560
‘e’ is a vowel.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.520
And ‘g’, ‘g’.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.440
‘g’ is a consonant.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.040
“Hit”.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.280
‘h’ is a consonant.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.600
‘i’ a vowel.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.280
And ‘t’ a consonant.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.800
“Top”.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.760
‘t’ is a consonant.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.600
‘o’ is a vowel.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.440
And ‘p’ a consonant.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.080
The last word is “cut”.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.320
‘c’ is a consonant.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.640
‘u’ a vowel.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.480
And ‘t’ a consonant.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.360
So, we have the main vowels:
‘a’, ’e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.720
Now, I said ‘y’ is a special vowel.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.800
That’s because sometimes it’s a vowel
and sometimes it’s a consonant.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.600
So, let’s look.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.160
In the word, “why”,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.080
the letter ‘y’ sounds like ‘i’.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.280
“Why”.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.480
So, it is a vowel.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.040
“Bicycle”.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.080
The letter ‘y’ sounds like ‘i’.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.840
“Bicycle”.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.720
‘i’ is the letter ‘i’, right,
it sounds like the letter ‘i’.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.120
So, in this case ‘y’ is also a vowel.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.800
“Pretty”.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.480
“Pretty”.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.640
‘y’ sounds like ‘e’.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.160
Okay…

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.960
“Pretty”.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.560
So, it’s a vowel.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.160
Now, in the last two words,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.000
“you” and “yes”, the letter ‘y’ is a consonant.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.960
Usually, if ‘y’ comes at the beginning of a word,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.360
or if it makes a /u/ sound,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.320
for example, “you”, “yes”,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.160
it is a consonant. Okay…

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.160
So again, five main vowels:
‘a’, ’e’, ’i’, ’o’, ’u’.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.840
And ‘y’ the special vowel.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:50.960
Now to help us remember vowels, we can say,
“a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y.”

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.760
Okay, repeat again after me.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.000
“a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y.”

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.560
One more time, faster.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.680
“a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y.”

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.120
Okay, and that’s the end of this video. Thank you.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.040
Hi everybody and welcome to this video.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.240
In this video, we’re going to&nbsp;
talk about using ‘a’ or ‘an’.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.600
Okay.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.600
We use ‘a’ or ‘an’ in front of nouns.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600
Well, what is a noun?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.440
A noun is a person, place, thing, or animal.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.200
Okay, so let’s look at the board.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.200
The first noun we have is “banana”.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.840
“banana”, starts with the consonant ‘b’.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.800
So, we put “a banana”.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.560
“a banana”.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.760
Look at the next word.
“Apple”.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.360
In this case, the first letter is ‘a’.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.080
‘a’ is a vowel.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.880
Remember the vowels are a, e, i, o, u,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.400
so we have to put ‘an’.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.880
“an apple”.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.640
“cat”.
 
Hmmm.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.480
The first letter, ‘c’, is a consonant.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.880
So, should we put, ‘a’ or ‘an’?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.680
Remember, if it’s a consonant, we have to put ‘a’.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.440
“a cat”.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.720
The next word, “boy”.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.600
Again, the word starts with a consonant: ‘b’.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.200
So, we have to say, “a boy”.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.040
The next word, “egg”, has the letter ‘e’ in front.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.920
‘e’ is a vowel.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.680
So, what do we put?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.720
We put ‘an’.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.840
If we read it, it sounds like “an egg.”

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.120
“an egg”.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.720
Okay, and the last word is “ant”.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.920
“ant” starts with the vowel ‘a’.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.160
So again, we must put……”an ant”.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.680
“an ant”.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.840
Now, let’s go through these words together.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.680
“a banana”.
“a banana”.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.080
“an apple”.
“an apple”.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.960
Keep in mind that when you have ‘an’ in front,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.440
it has to sound like almost one word.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
“an apple”.
“an apple”.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.280
“a cat”.
“a cat”.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.160
“a boy”.
“a boy”.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.800
“an egg”.
“an egg”.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:39.840
“an egg”.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.400
Again, it sounds like one word.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.960
"an egg".&nbsp;

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.760
"an ant"
"an ant"

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.120
"an ant"

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.480
Okay. Let’s move on the next part.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.840
Okay, let’s do some extra practice.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.200
Ahhh, I have some nouns on the board.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.360
Remember, a noun is a person, place, thing
or animal.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.680
So let’s go through them one by one.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.280
“a book”, “book” is a thing.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.640
It’s a thing that we read.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.080
“park”, is a place.
 
It’s a place we go.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.880
“umbrella” is a thing.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.840
Right. Umbrella is a thing that we use when it’s
raining.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.520
“elephant”.
“elephant” is an animal.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.200
“doctor”.
“doctor” is a person.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.280
And “orange”.
"orange" is a thing that we eat.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.200
Okay. Now, I’m going to say ‘a’ or ‘an’
in front of the nouns.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.200
I want you to listen and see if you can hear
the difference.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.000
Okay…

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.800
We have “book”.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.040
In that case we say, “a book”.
“a book”.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.880
We have to say, “a book”.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.960
Okay…

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.200
The next one is “park”.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.200
We say, “a park”.
“a park”.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.320
Remember, we put ‘a’ in front of words
that begin with consonants.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.800
‘b’ and ‘p’ are consonants.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.080
That’s why we say, “a book”, “a park”.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.520
Okay…

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.200
How about the next word?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.000
“an umbrella”.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.160
“an umbrella”.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.720
Could you here the difference?
“an umbrella”.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.040
We say ‘an’ because umbrella starts with
a vowel: ‘u’.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.480
“an umbrella”.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.040
Okay…
“elephant”.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.640
We should we say?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.680
“an elephant”.
“an elephant”.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.440
Again, 'elephant' starts with a vowel.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.960
“a doctor”.
“a doctor”.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.840
“a doctor”.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.040
And the last word, “an orange”.
“an orange”.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.120
Again, we have to say, “an orange” because
‘o’ is a vowel.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.720
So, let’s go through each word one more time.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.080
“a book”.
“a book”.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.200
Okay…

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.240
“a park”.
“a park”.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.000
“an umbrella”.
“an umbrella”.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.240
Notice it sounds like one word.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.680
“an umbrella”.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.920
“an elephant”
“an elephant”

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.400
“a doctor”
“a doctor”

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.880
And the last one.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.280
“an orange”
“an orange”

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.440
Okay. So that’s the end of this video.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.280
I hope you can remember when to use ‘a’ and ‘an’.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.840
Okay, thank you. Bye.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.720
Hi, everybody and welcome to this video.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.400
Now, in this lesson I’m going to talk about
singular and plural nouns.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.200
Okay.
Singular means one.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.600
And plural means more than one or many.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.160
Okay.
So let’s look at the board.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.200
This part is showing singular nouns.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.920
Okay, remember, singular means one.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.560
Okay.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.120
So when the noun is singular,
we put ‘a’ or ‘an’.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.480
So let’s look.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:23.840
“a ring”

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.280
That means one ring.
“a ring”

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.280
“a dog”
Again, one dog.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.480
“a dog”

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.480
“a teacher”
One teacher.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.840
“a teacher”

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.920
“an apple”
“an apple”

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.600
One apple.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.800
“an egg”
“an egg”

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.040
One egg.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.960
So again, one…. noun is singular.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.680
Okay.
Now over here, we have plural nouns.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.840
Plural means more than one.
Two, three, four, and so on.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.760
So, many.
Okay.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.520
So, when we have a plural noun, we have to,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.360
don’t forget, we have to put ‘s’ or ‘es’.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.240
Again, if there’s more than one,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.920
if the noun is plural,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.560
you have to put ‘s’ or ‘es’.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.800
Now the nouns here, you just have to add an ‘s’.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.000
Okay, and we’re going to&nbsp;
go through them right now.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.640
“two rings”.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.320
Okay, we had one ring.
“a ring”.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.440
Now we have “two rings.”
With an ‘s’.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.560
Okay.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.480
We had “a dog”.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.840
The plural is “three dogs”.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.840
Again, ‘s’
“three dogs”

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.800
“a teacher”
One teacher

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.200
“four teachers”
“four teachers”

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.200
Don’t forget the ‘s’.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.960
Okay, you must not forget that.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.480
“an apple”.
That’s one apple.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.040
Then we have plural.
“five apples”

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.200
“five apples”

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Okay.
And the last one.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
“an egg”.
One egg.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.760
“six eggs”

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.120
Don’t forget ‘s’.
“six eggs”

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.680
Okay.
I really need you to remember that.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.520
“two rings”

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.600
“three dogs”

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.000
“four teachers”

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.400
“five apples”

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.840
and “six eggs”.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.800
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.280
Now we have some more nouns.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.800
These nouns are a little bit different.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.760
Uhhh, when they’re singular it’s the same.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.840
You put ‘a’ or ‘an’ in front.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.960
But when you want to make them&nbsp;
plural, you have to add ‘es’.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.840
Remember, I said, you can add ‘s’ or ‘es’
to make a noun plural…more than one.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.600
So again, these nouns you have to add ‘es’.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.680
So let’s go through them one more time.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.000
Okay.
So we have “a bus”.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.920
“a bus”

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.840
Again, that means one bus.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.240
“a box”
“a box”

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.720
“a watch”
“a watch”

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.680
Okay, one.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.640
“a kiss”
“a kiss”

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.160
And “an ax”.
“an ax”

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.440
One.
“an ax”

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.280
Okay.
Now, we’re going to move on to the plural.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.640
Remember, again, to make the plural, or more&nbsp;

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.160
than one, here, we add ‘es’.
Okay.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.720
“a bus”
One.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.400
“two buses”
“two buses”

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.320
“a box”

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.720
“three boxes”
“three boxes”

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.040
“a watch”.
“four watches”

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.320
‘es’ right.
“four watches”

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.880
“a kiss”
One.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.560
“five kisses”
“five kisses”

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.000
Add the ‘es’.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.160
And the last one.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.560
“an ax”
“an ax”

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.520
Okay, we have “six axes”.
“six axes”

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.520
So don’t forget.
We have to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.800
‘es’ to make these nouns
plural.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.040
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.480
So, how do we know if we should put ‘s’
or ‘es’ to make the noun plural?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.520
Well, for most nouns, you just have to put ‘s’.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.440
Okay, for most of them.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.520
But, for some, you have to put ‘es’.
And how do we know?

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:37.840
Well…

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.280
Let’s look at the board.
We have some nouns.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.800
The first one is “church”.
Okay.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.680
“Church” ends in ‘ch’.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.440
So if the noun ends in ‘ch’, you have
to put ‘es’.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.640
Okay.
So it becomes “churches”.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.200
So again, if the noun ends in ‘ch’,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.440
add ‘es’ at the end to make it plural.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.040
The same goes for the next word “brush”.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.480
You’ll notice “brush” ends in ‘sh’.
Okay.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:22.080
So if it ends in ‘sh’, same thing, we
add ‘es’ at the end to make it plural.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.440
Okay.
The next word is 'fox'.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.200
We have the letter ‘x’ at the end.
Okay.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.680
All nouns that end in ‘x’, we have to
put ‘es’ to make it plural.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.320
Okay, so, ‘ch’, ‘sh’, ‘x’.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.680
If the noun ends with these, put ‘es’.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.920
And the last one is “dress”.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.920
Okay, we have ‘ss’ at the end.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.360
Same thing.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.920
Put ‘es’ at the end to make it plural.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.120
Okay.
“dresses”

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.040
Again, if it ends in ‘ss’ put ‘es’.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:05.200
Okay, so please, don’t&nbsp;
forget ‘ch’, ‘sh’, ‘x’, ‘ss’,&nbsp;

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.000
we must put ‘es’ at the end.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.400
Most of the other nouns we just add ‘s’.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.200
Okay.
Now we have some special nouns on this side.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.560
“Potato, tomato, volcano”.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.720
Now, most nouns that end in ‘o’, like “photo”,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.040
all we have to do is add an ‘s’
to make it plural.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.800
“photos”.
Okay.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.680
But these are special because we actually&nbsp;

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.960
have to put ‘es’ at the end… to make
them…plural.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.760
Okay.
So we have “potatoes, tomatoes, volcanoes”.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.240
Again, these are a little bit special.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.920
For most nouns that end in ‘o’, we just
add ‘s’.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.120
Okay, and, uhhh, let’s go to the final part.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.320
Okay, let’s do some extra practice.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.600
On the board, I have some nouns.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.200
Some are singular and some are plural.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.680
We have to decide together&nbsp;
if we should put ‘s’ or ‘es’

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.160
or make them singular.
Okay.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.400
So you have to listen carefully and&nbsp;
remember what we learned in this video.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.880
Okay.
“two books”

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.080
Right, this is plural.
There are two.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.680
“two books”
We have to put an ‘s’.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.520
“two books”

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.160
Okay.
The next one.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.360
“three class”
Hmmmm.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.640
“class” ends with an ‘s’.
So what do we put?

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.480
“three classes”
“three classes”

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.400
Okay.
So again the plural is “three classes”.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.160
Okay.&nbsp;

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.640
“a lion”
“a lion”

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.920
Do we have to put anything?
No.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.440
No ‘s’ or ‘es’ because this is singular.
There’s just one lion.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.160
“a lion”

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.280
“six hats”
“six hats”

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.280
We have to put an ‘s’.
“six hats”

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.920
Okay.
The next noun is “seven match”.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.440
What do we put?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.000
Well, we have a ‘ch’.
So we have to put “matches”.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.520
“seven matches”
“seven matches”

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.760
Okay.
And the last one is “one bat”.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.840
“one bat”.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.960
We do not put an ‘s’ or ‘es’ because
again, it’s just one.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.680
We don’t have to put anything after ‘bat’.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.040
Okay, this is singular.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.640
Okay, so, in this video, we learned how to
make a noun singular.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.200
Okay.
And how to make a noun plural.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.280
Remember, singular means one.
Plural means more than one.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.320
And remember, don’t forget, we have to put&nbsp;

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.040
‘s’ or ‘es’.
Okay.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.680
And thanks for joining.
That’s the end of this video.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.000
Bye.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.840
Hi everybody and welcome to this video.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.600
In this video, we’re going to&nbsp;
talk about subjective pronouns.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.600
So, let’s take a look at the board.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.760
Here they are.
The subjective pronouns.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.000
Please take a careful look.
They’re very important in English.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.720
Okay.
So, the first subjective pronoun is ‘I’.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.760
“I” means me.
“I’m Esther”.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:40.960
I

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.040
He
Now, “he” is only used for boys or men.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.480
Okay.
He

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.880
So another boy or man is “he”.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.840
“She” is used for girls or women.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.680
Okay.
She

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.680
It
“It”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:12.080
is used for a place like a school,
an animal like a dog, or a thing like a chair.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.200
Okay.
It

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.960
The next one is “you”.
“You” means you.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.680
Okay. “you”.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.840
We
“We” means other people and me.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.160
For example, “I sing”, “you sing”,
then “we sing”.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.600
Okay. “we”.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.880
And the last one is “they”.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.440
“They” means many people,&nbsp;
places, animals or things.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.440
Okay.
So, more than one.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.440
If there’s more than one, we use&nbsp;
the subjective pronoun ‘they’.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.160
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.320
Okay, so let’s practice together&nbsp;
with subjective pronouns.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.320
The first sentence on the&nbsp;
board says, “Jenny sings”.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.440
Now Jenny is one girl.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.240
So we can say, “She sings”.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.600
“Jack sings”.
Jack is one boy.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.640
So we have to say, “he sings”.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.560
The last sentence says, “Jenny and Jack
sing”.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.400
Now Jenny and Jack are two people.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.040
So we have to say, “they sing”.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.240
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.920
Okay, let’s do some more practice.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.840
The first sentence on the board says,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.440
“The cat runs”.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:50.320
‘The cat’ is an animal, so we have to
say, “It runs”.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.400
The next sentence says, “The dog and cat run”.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.280
Now, ‘the dog and cat’, they are two animals.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.880
So anytime you have two or more&nbsp;
things, we say, “They run”.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:05.840
‘They’.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:13.120
Okay, now, for the last sentence, I’m&nbsp;
going to talk about my cat, Ongee.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.240
Ongee is a cat.
He’s an animal.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.120
But he has a name.
He’s a boy cat.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.760
Okay and I love him.
And he’s like family.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.760
So, “Ongee runs”.
I can say “He runs”.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.920
Okay.
Let’s move on to the next part.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.840
Okay, here are some more examples.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.720
But, this time, you have to figure out the
subjective pronoun together with me.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.640
Okay.
So, “My students study”.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.880
What should we use?

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.440
Well, ‘My students’, there’s an ‘s’.
Right.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.720
They’re people and there’s more than one.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.080
Many people.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.840
So we have to use the subjective pronoun, ‘they’.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.320
“They study”.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.480
The next example.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.960
“John is handsome”.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.400
Okay, ‘John’, that’s a person.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960
There’s only one.
Right…

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.040
And it’s a boy, ‘John’.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.560
So what should we use?

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.840
We have to use the subjective pronoun, ‘he’.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.960
One boy.
We say, “he”.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.360
“He is handsome”.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.160
Okay, the last one.
“Pizza is delicious”.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.040
‘Pizza’ is a thing.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.280
And there’s only one.
Right.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.440
There’s no ‘s’.
One pizza.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.640
We say, “it”.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.800
“It is delicious”.
Okay.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.800
Let’s move on to some more examples.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.920
Okay, the first example says,

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.680
“Seoul is a city”.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.240
Now, ‘Seoul’ is a place.
Okay.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.240
So we have to use the subjective pronoun, ‘it’.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.320
“It is a city”.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.520
The next example says,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.160
“My parents love Ongee”.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.160
Now, ‘Ongee’ is my cat.
“My parents love Ongee”.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.640
Well, ‘my parents’, they are two people.
My mom and my dad.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.000
So, what do I use?

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.400
I have to say, “they”.
“They love Ongee”.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.440
The last example is very&nbsp;
similar to the second one.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.240
“My parents and I love Ongee”.
Okay.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.800
The difference is… it says, “and I”.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.600
So this is ‘my parents’ with ‘me’.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:00.320
So I have to say, “we”.
“We love Ongee”.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.000
Okay.
All of us.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.680
Okay, so, in this video we&nbsp;
learned about subjective pronouns.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.320
I hope you guys have a good understanding&nbsp;
of ‘when’ and ‘how’ to use them.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.600
Thank you for watching and I’ll see you
guys next time.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.840
Bye.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.440
Hi, everybody.
Welcome to this video.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.480
Now, in this video, we’re going to talk
about subjective pronouns,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.800
‘be’ verbs, and also, contractions.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.640
So let’s take a look at the board.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.600
Okay.
First, we have the subjective pronouns.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.760
And we have the ‘be’ verbs: am, is, and are.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.960
Okay.
So let’s look at the first one.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.880
“I am”.
“I am Esther”.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.840
The contraction for ‘I am’ is ‘I’m’.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.000
“I’m”.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.600
Now, a contraction is a more common way of
saying subjective pronouns and their ‘be’ verb.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.200
It’s faster and quicker and shorter.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.800
Okay, it’s more common.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.880
I want you to use contractions.
Okay.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.560
So, “I am” becomes “I’m”.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.840
“He is” – “he’s”.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.600
“She is” - “she’s”.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.280
“It is” - “it’s”.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.000
Okay, let’s move on to the bottom.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.840
“You are” becomes “you’re”.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.120
“You’re”.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.880
“We are” – “we’re”.
“We’re”.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.480
and “They are”.
The contraction is “they’re”.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:57.840
“They’re”.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.800
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.760
Okay.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.080
We’re going to take a look at some sentences
using the ‘be’ verbs.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.760
Now, notice on the board,&nbsp;
I only used contractions.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.560
Okay.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.240
For example, instead of “I am”, I’m
going to say “I’m”.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.080
So, the first sentence.
“I’m a student”.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.200
Okay.
This means one.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.320
So we have to say, “a student”.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.040
“a”

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.400
Now many people make the mistake of saying,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.440
“I’m student”, but that’s wrong.
Okay.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.880
You have to put ‘a’.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.880
Now, before I read it, you&nbsp;
have to listen carefully.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.000
‘I’m a’ - sounds like one word.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.560
“I’m a…”
“I’m a…”

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.400
“I’m a student”.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.200
Okay.
Please repeat after me.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.720
“I’m a student”.
“I’m a student”.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.040
Okay, the next one, again, sounds like one word.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.190
“He’s a…”.
“He’s a…”.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200
Okay.so…

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:57.872
“He’s a student”.

00:29:57.872 --> 00:29:58.320
Please repeat.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.200
“He’s a student”.
“He’s a student”.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.640
Same thing.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.240
“She’s a student”.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.440
Please repeat.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.480
“She’s a student”.
“She’s a student”.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.440
Okay.
The next sentence has ‘it’.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.440
Now remember, ‘it’ is only used for a
place, a thing or an animal.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.000
So we can’t have those things be a student.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.880
So we have to say, “It’s a dog”.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.280
Okay, please repeat.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.080
“It’s a dog”.
“It’s a dog”.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.480
Okay, the next one.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.160
“You’re a student”.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.640
Please repeat.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.320
“You’re a student”.
“You’re a student”.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.840
Okay.
Now let’s look at ‘we’re’.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.040
“We’re students”.
Okay.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.520
We took out the ‘a’ and we put an ‘s’

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.160
because ‘we’re’ means many people.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.800
Not one student, but many students.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.840
So, we have to say, “we’re students”.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.760
Please repeat.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.400
“We’re students”.
“We’re students”.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.440
The same thing goes for ‘they’.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.360
Again, ‘they’ means many people…or many things.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.400
Here, we put ‘s’.
And we took out the ‘a’.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.800
So, “they’re students”.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.720
Please repeat.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.240
“They’re students”.
“They’re students”.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.000
Okay, we’re going to look at some more examples.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.400
Please listen and repeat carefully.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.520
Let’s start with the first one: “I’m”.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.280
“I’m a boy”.
“I’m a boy”.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.840
“I’m a girl”.
“I’m a girl”.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:50.640
“He’s”.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.400
“He’s a man”.
“He’s a man”.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:58.320
“He’s a boy”.
“He’s a boy”.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:31:59.920
“She’s”.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.880
“She’s a woman”.
“She’s a woman”.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.520
“She’s a girl”.
“She’s a girl”.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.160
“It’s”.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:17.440
“It’s a chair”.
“It’s a chair”.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:25.600
“It’s a cat”.
“It’s a cat”.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.080
“You’re”.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.520
“You’re a singer”.
“You’re a singer”.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.480
“You’re a friend”.
“You’re a friend”.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.920
“We’re”.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.040
“We’re sisters”.
“We’re sisters”.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:51.680
“We’re brothers”.
“We’re brothers”.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:53.627
“They’re”.

00:32:53.627 --> 00:32:59.440
“They’re people”.
“They’re people”.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.120
“They’re cars”.
“They’re cars”.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.840
Well I hope that this video helped you understand

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.280
how to use subjective pronouns,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.800
their ‘be’ verbs, and also contractions.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.800
Now, before we go, I wanted to share a&nbsp;
little bit about myself using the lesson.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.720
So, first, remember, “I’m a…”.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.520
“I’m a girl”.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.360
Also, “I’m a teacher”.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.800
“I’m an American”.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.000
Now, the word ‘American’&nbsp;
starts with the vowel ‘a’,

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.760
so we have to say ‘an’.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.080
“I’m an American”.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.440
And “I’m an animal lover”.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.760
Again, same thing.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.320
‘Animal’ starts with the vowel ‘a’,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.360
so we have to put ‘an’.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.600
“I’m an animal lover”.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.800
And that means someone who loves animals.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.920
I love dogs and cats and other animals.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.160
So, “I’m an animal lover”.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:04.800
Okay.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.960
Well, that’s it and thank you for watching.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.800
And I’ll see you guys next time.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.120
Bye.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.320
Hi, everybody.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.160
In this video, we’re going to talk about
subjective pronouns,

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.000
‘be’ verbs,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.480
and how to use them with the word ‘not’.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.760
Okay. So, let’s look at the board to help us out.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.800
Now the first sentence says, “I’m not
a student”.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.080
‘Not’ means it’s not true.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.400
No.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.880
So remember, “I’m a student” means ‘yes’.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.760
“I’m a student”.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.320
I go to school, and I learn.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.880
“I’m not a student” means ‘no’.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.080
“I’m a teacher” or
“No, I’m not a student”.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.120
Okay.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:02.160
Now, notice, we first have the subjective
pronoun and the ‘be’ verb.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.240
Then, we put ‘not’.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.200
Okay.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.040
‘Not’ comes after.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.440
And then we have the noun.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:09.680
Okay.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.680
“I’m not a student”.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:12.960
Okay.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.120
Now, also, listen carefully.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.640
“Not a…” sounds like one word.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.080
“I’m not a student”.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.120
“Not a…”.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.360
“I’m not a student”.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.160
Okay, let’s look at the next one.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.080
“He’s not a student”.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.800
“He’s not a student”.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.320
“She’s not a student”.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.960
“She’s not a student”.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.800
“It’s not a dog”.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:48.080
Remember, ‘it’ is used for place, thing or animal.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.000
So, “It’s not a dog”.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:51.920
Okay.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.760
“You’re not a student”.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.000
“You’re not a student”.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.120
Okay, the next one is a little bit different.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.400
We have ‘we are’.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.920
“We’re”.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.040
Now, remember, ‘we’ means more than one.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.760
Many.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.400
Okay.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.840
So we say “students”.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.800
We put an ‘s’ and we don’t put an ‘a’ in front.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.120
“We’re not students”.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.520
“We’re not students”.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.440
Okay.
And ‘they’re’ is the same thing.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.440
It means more than one.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.840
So, “They’re not students”.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.840
“They’re not students”.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.520
Okay, we’re going to look at some more examples.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.280
I want you to listen carefully and repeat
after the examples.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.720
Let’s start with the first one.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.840
“I’m not”.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.080
“I’m not a boy”.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.200
“I’m not a boy”.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.240
“I’m not a girl”.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.360
“I’m not a girl”.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.400
“He’s not”.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.480
“He’s not a man”.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.680
“He’s not a man”.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.200
“He’s not a boy”.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.160
“He’s not a boy”.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.040
“She’s not”.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.360
“She’s not a woman”.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.120
“She’s not a woman”.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.480
“She’s not a girl”.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.840
“She’s not a girl”.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.480
“It’s not”.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.040
“It’s not a chair”.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.480
“It’s not a chair”.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.920
“It’s not a cat”.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.040
“It’s not a cat”.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.400
“You’re not”.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.720
“You’re not a singer”

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.480
“You’re not a singer”.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.240
“You’re not a friend”.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.280
“You’re not a friend”.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.160
“We’re not”.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.200
“We’re not sisters”.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.840
“We’re not sisters”.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.000
“We’re not brothers”.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.040
“We’re not brothers”.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.280
“They’re not”.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.000
“They’re not people”.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.840
“They’re not people”.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.080
“They’re not cars”.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.600
“They’re not cars”.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:30.160
Okay, so in this video, we learned how to
use subjective pronouns

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.600
with the ‘be’ verb

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.120
and how to use them with the word ‘not’. Okay.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.840
So, I wrote some sentences about&nbsp;
myself using what we learned.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.720
So remember, “I’m not a…”.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:43.680
Okay.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.320
“I’m not a boy”.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.440
“I’m not a boy”.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.160
“I’m not a student”.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.320
“I’m not a student”.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.200
“I’m not a Canadian”.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.760
“I’m not a Canadian”.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.080
And the last one.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.120
“I’m not a loser”.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.280
“I’m not a loser”.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.200
Okay.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.520
So that was a little bit about me.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.080
Thanks for watching and&nbsp;
I’ll see you guys next time.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.840
Bye.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.280
Hi, everybody.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.160
In this video, I’m going to talk about how
to make questions using subjective pronouns

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.920
and ‘be’ verbs.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.320
Okay.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.000
So, let’s take a look at the board.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.080
So, this example sentence says.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.120
“I’m a student”.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.560
Okay.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.720
Remember, “I’m” is just a contraction for “I am”.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.000
Okay.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.440
So, “I’m a student”.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.320
“I am a student”.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.760
They mean the same thing.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.520
Now when we want to make a question,

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.280
we just have to make a simple&nbsp;
change. It’s very easy.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.760
All you have to do is put&nbsp;
the ‘be’ verb in the front.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.200
Okay.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.920
So, “Am I a student?”.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.480
“Am I a student?”.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.120
The ‘be’ verb comes in the front.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.680
Okay.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.960
I also want you to listen to my intonation.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.200
When I say it in a sentence, “I’m a student”.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.600
“I’m a student”.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.960
Okay, then when I say it in a question.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.080
“Am I a student?”.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.240
“Am I a student?”.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.320
Notice my intonation goes up for the question.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.400
Okay, now there are two possible answers for
this question.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.000
“Am I a student?”.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.960
The answers you can say are:
“Yes, I am”.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.680
“Yes, I am”.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.200
Okay.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.840
And, “No, I’m not”.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.920
“No, I’m not”.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.000
Okay.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.320
We’re going to look at some more examples.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.600
Please make sure you repeat after each example.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.080
Let’s look at the first one.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.840
“Am I…?”.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.520
“Am I a girl?”.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.080
“Yes, I am”.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.160
“Am I a boy?”.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.800
“No, I’m not”.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.280
“Am I a singer?”.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.840
“Yes, I am”.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.920
“Am I a friend?”.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.240
“No, I’m not”.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:33.040
Now, we’re going to talk about “he is”
and “she is” and how to use them in questions.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.120
So let’s look at the sentence on the board.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.440
“He’s a doctor”.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.360
Or…

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.880
“She’s a doctor”.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:50.160
Remember, “he’s” and “she’s” are
contractions for “he is” and “she is”.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.960
The ‘be’ verb there is ‘is’.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:59.600
So, when we make a question, we have to move
the ‘be’ verb to the front.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:41:59.920
Okay.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.840
So we put ‘is’ in the front.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.400
“Is he a doctor?”.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.280
“Is she a doctor?”.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.480
Okay.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.280
Very easy.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.520
Just put the ‘be’ verb in the front.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.840
Now I want you to listen to the intonation again.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.920
“He’s a doctor”.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.360
Okay.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.120
The intonation is going down.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.240
“Is he a doctor?”.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.920
In the question, again, the intonation goes up.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.440
Okay.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.920
Now when you answer, they are several possible
answers you can give.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:34.800
So…

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.360
“Yes, he is”.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.120
Or…

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.440
“Yes, she is”.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.880
Okay.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.240
That’s easy.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.280
When you come to know, this is where it gets
a little tricky, but you can do it.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.920
“No, he isn’t”.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.440
Okay, “isn’t” is a contraction for “is not”.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.320
Okay.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.920
“No, he isn’t”.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:00.720
Or…

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.280
“No, she isn’t”.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.760
Okay, so you can use “she isn’t”, “he isn’t”.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.720
Another answer you can give is “No, he’s not”.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.080
Or…

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.400
“No, she’s not”.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:22.720
You already know this is a contraction for
‘he is’ and ‘she is’.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.480
So, “No, he’s not”.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.480
“No, she’s not”.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:27.680
Okay.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.000
So these are both common.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.400
And they’re both ok to use.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.200
Okay.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.040
So, remember, we can give two&nbsp;
different answers for ‘no’.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.120
Alright, now we’re going to&nbsp;
look at some more examples.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.160
Please make sure you repeat after each example.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.800
“Is he…?”, “Is she…?”.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.800
“Is he a man?”

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.200
“Yes, he is”.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.840
“Is he a cowboy?”.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.800
“No, he isn’t.”

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.040
“Is she a woman?”

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.000
“Yes, she is”.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.960
“Is she a cowgirl?”.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.840
“No, she’s not.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.520
Now, we’re going to move on to ‘it is’.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:13.920
Okay.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.320
And how to use that in a question.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.320
So, let’s look at the board.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.640
“It’s a dog”.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.000
Okay, we have the contraction “it’s”.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.040
Remember, “it’s” is a contraction for “it is”.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.360
The ‘be’ verb is ‘is’.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.760
When we make a question, remember, we have
to put the ‘be’ verb in the front.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.680
“Is it a dog?”

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.760
“Is it a dog?”

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.520
Okay.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.480
The intonation goes up for the question.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.160
“Is it a dog?”

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:49.840
Okay.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.040
Now, there are several answers you can give.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.720
The first one is “Yes, it is”.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.360
“Yes, it is”.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.040
Okay.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.400
When you say “no”, you can give two answers.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.320
“No, it isn’t”.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.960
“No, it isn’t”.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.640
Remember, “isn’t” is a contraction for “is not”.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.120
Okay.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.400
We can also say “No, it’s not”.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.720
“No, it’s not”.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.400
“It’s” is a contraction for “it is”.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:25.760
Okay.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:31.120
So again, remember, we have these two answers
for ‘no’, but they’re both common and

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.160
they’re both ok to use when you say “no”.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.520
Okay.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.600
We’re going to look at some more examples.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.640
Please make sure you follow&nbsp;
and repeat after each one.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.160
“Is it…?”.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.320
“Is it a book?”.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.600
“Yes, it is”.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.160
“Is it a chair?”.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.120
“No, it isn’t”.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.040
“Is it a shoe?”.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.520
“Yes, it is”.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:45:59.840
“Is it a car?”.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.320
“No, it’s not”.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:09.920
Now, we’re going to move on to “you are”
and put that in a question.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.040
Okay.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.360
On the board the sentence says.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.320
“You’re a boy”.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.200
Remember, “you’re” is a contraction for “you are”.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.680
The ‘be’ verb is ‘are’.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.840
So we have to put that in&nbsp;
the front of the question.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.840
“Are you a boy?”

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.000
“Are you a boy?”

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.080
Okay.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.960
When we answer, it’s very simple.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.240
We can say, “Yes, I am” or “No, I’m not”.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:41.920
Okay.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.400
We’re going to look at some more examples.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.200
Please follow and repeat after each one.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:48.960
“Are you…?”

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.760
“Are you a Korean?”

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.840
“Yes, I am.”

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.440
“Are you a clown?”

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.240
“No, I’m not.”

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.960
“Are you a nurse?”

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.680
“Yes, I am.”

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.480
“Are you a dancer?”

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.040
“No, I’m not.”

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:19.360
Now, let’s talk about “we are” and how
to use that in a question.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:20.720
Okay.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.560
So the sentence here says, “We’re teachers”.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.240
Okay.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.360
“We’re” is a contraction from “we are”.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.760
So the ‘be’ verb ‘are’ goes in the front.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.600
“Are we teachers?”

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.840
“Are we teachers?”

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.280
Okay.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.320
When we answer, we can say several things.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.760
“Yes, we are.”

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.400
“Yes, we are.”

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:47.360
Or…

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.760
“No, we aren’t.”

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.840
Listen… “aren’t.”

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.080
“No, we aren’t.”

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.000
“Aren’t” is a contraction for “are not”.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.000
Or we can say, “No, we’re not”.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.560
“No, we’re not”.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.840
And you know “We’re” is a&nbsp;
contraction for “we are”.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.040
Okay.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.880
We’re going to look at some more examples.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.800
Please repeat after each one.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.720
“Are we…?”

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.840
“Are we boys?”

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.600
“Yes, we are.”

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.640
“Are we girls?”

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.440
“No, we aren’t.”

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.320
“Are we friends?”

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.840
“Yes, we are.”

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.640
“Are we pro-gamers?”

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.520
“No, we aren’t.”

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.960
Now, we’re moving on to ‘they are’ in a question.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.600
The sentence on the board says, “They’re friends”.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.400
Remember, ‘They’re’ is a&nbsp;
contraction for ‘they are’.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.160
The ‘be’ verb ‘are’ goes in the front
of the question.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.840
“Are they friends?”

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.000
“Are they friends?”

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:05.920
Okay.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.760
Now when we answer, we can say, “Yes, they are.”

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.080
“Yes, they are.”

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.160
Or, we can say, “No, they aren’t.”

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.560
“No, they aren’t.”

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.800
‘Aren’t’ is a contraction for ‘are not’.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.200
The last thing we can say is “No, they’re not”.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.840
“No, they’re not.”

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.200
‘They’re’ is a contraction for ‘they are’.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.000
These two answers for ‘no’ are both correct.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.600
And they’re both common.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.680
So you can say either one.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:42.960
Okay.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.440
We’re going to look at some more examples now.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.680
Please repeat after each example.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.080
“Are they…?”

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.480
“Are they tourists?”

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.960
“Yes, they are.”

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.840
“Are they dogs?”

00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.920
“No, they aren’t.”

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.480
“Are they computers?”

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.560
“Yes, they are.”

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.880
“Are they birds?”

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.880
“No, they’re not.”

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.280
Okay.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.560
In this lesson, we learned how to change a&nbsp;

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.400
subjective pronoun and a&nbsp;
‘be’ verb into a question.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.480
Remember, when you’re making a question,
you have to put the ‘b’ verb in the beginning.

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.360
Okay.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.280
Alright, that’s the end of this video.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.480
Thanks for watching.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:28.800
Bye.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.080
Okay, so this is a review video.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.480
We learned about subjective&nbsp;
pronouns and ‘be’ verbs.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:52.320
We also learned how to use them in a negative
sentence and in a question.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.480
So, let’s look at the board for review.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.280
“I am a teacher.”

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.960
Remember, ‘am’ is the ‘be’ verb.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.400
“I am a teacher.”

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.400
Okay, we also learned contractions: “I’m”.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.840
“I’m a teacher.”

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.000
“I’m a teacher.”

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.600
Okay, this is a negative sentence.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.880
“I’m not a teacher.”

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.880
“I’m not a teacher.”

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.000
Remember, ‘not’ goes after the ‘be’ verb.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:22.480
Okay.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.080
And here’s a question.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.200
“Am I a teacher?”

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.200
“Am I a teacher?”

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.680
Remember, the ‘be’ verb comes in the front
for a question.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:32.960
Okay.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.440
We’re going to listen to some more examples.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.760
I want you to repeat after each one.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.360
Okay.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.800
Let’s look at some examples.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.440
“He is a king.”

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.600
“He is a king.”

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.600
“He’s a king.”

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.840
“He’s a king.”

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.840
“He’s not a king.”

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.760
“He’s not a king.”

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.760
“Is he a king?”

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.440
“Is he a king?”

00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.280
Next.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.200
“She is a queen.”

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.240
“She is a queen.”

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.200
“She’s a queen.”

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:06.880
“She’s a queen.”

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.040
“She’s not a queen.”

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.800
“She’s not a queen.”

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.880
“Is she a queen?”

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.480
“Is she a queen?”

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:16.640
Next.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.640
“It is a monkey.”

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.040
“It is a monkey.”

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.040
“It’s a monkey.”

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.640
“It’s a monkey.”

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.720
“It’s not a monkey.”

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.640
“It’s not a monkey.”

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.560
“Is it a monkey?”

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.320
“Is it a monkey?”

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.160
Next.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.000
“You are a cook.”

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.160
“You are a cook.”

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.000
“You’re a cook.”

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.520
“You’re a cook.”

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.440
“You’re not a cook.”

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.920
“You’re not a cook.”

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.880
“Are you a cook?”

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.560
“Are you a cook?”

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:50.560
Next.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.320
“We are friends.”

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.320
“We are friends.”

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:56.720
“We’re friends.”

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.640
“We’re friends.”

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.440
“We’re not friends.”

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.720
“We’re not friends.”

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.400
“Are we friends?”

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.400
“Are we friends?”

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.280
And last.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.600
“They are monkeys.”

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.840
“They are monkeys.”

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.920
“They’re monkeys.”

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.840
“They’re monkeys.”

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.160
“They’re not monkeys.”

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.520
“They’re not monkeys.”

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.600
“Are they monkeys?”

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.280
“Are they monkeys?”

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.080
So that was our review of subjective pronouns,

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.920
‘be’ verbs,

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.080
how to use them with ‘not’,

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.240
and how to use them in questions.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.960
I really hope that you repeated&nbsp;
each example that I gave

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.160
because pronunciation is very important.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.320
Now, if you didn’t, you should go back and
watch it again and repeat.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.520
Okay. Well that’s all. Thank you.

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.840
Bye.

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:06.000
This is a checkup for subjective pronouns
and ‘be’ verbs.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.080
Let’s take a look at the board.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.840
The first sentence.

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.800
“___, are bags.”

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.000
Now, bags are things.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.240
So we can’t say “he” or “she” or,
you know, any of those.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.040
We have to use “it” or “they”.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.360
Now, we have “are….

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.040
bags”.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:27.760
With an ‘s’.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.000
So that means more than one.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.760
We have to use ‘they’.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.840
“They are bags.”

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.640
Okay.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.120
The next sentence we have an animal.

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.880
“____ is a dog.”

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:43.920
Okay.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.760
But just one.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.600
Right?
’a’ dog.

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.600
So this time we use ‘it’.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.480
“It is a dog.”

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.880
Now let’s look at these two.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.840
“The girl is an artist.”

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.240
We have ‘the girl’.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.160
What is the subjective pronoun for one girl?

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:06.480
“She.”

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.680
“She is an artist.”

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.320
These two sentences have the same meaning.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.200
They’re the same.

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.880
Okay, and on the bottom, we have a question.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.520
When we ask a question, we have to put the
‘be’ verb first.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.400
“Are ___ pandas?”

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.960
“Are ___ pandas?”

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.080
With an ‘s’.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.000
That means more than one.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.160
So, we say, “they”.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.480
“Are they pandas?”

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.560
“Yes, ____ are.”

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.760
Again plural.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.760
So we just use the same.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.560
“They.”

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.840
“Yes, they are.”

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.560
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:55.200
Okay, now we’re going to focus on negatives
and questions.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.560
Okay, the first sentence says,

00:55:58.560 --> 00:55:59.840
“I’m a student”.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.880
Okay, “I am…I’m a student”.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.160
Okay.

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.920
What if I’m a teacher?

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.520
Okay, it’s not true.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.040
I need ‘not’.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:09.360
Right…

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.040
Remember, ‘not’ goes after the ‘be’
verb.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.840
“I am…am not.”

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.760
And then the noun.
“…a student.”

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.240
“I’m not a student.”

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:23.600
Okay.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.080
“They are teachers.”

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.840
Okay.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.840
And now we have some other people...

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.920
and that’s not true.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:37.280
“They are not teachers.”

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:44.000
Again, after the ‘be’ verb ‘are’ and
before the noun ‘teachers’.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.160
“They are not teachers.”

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:47.520
Okay.

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.760
Now, I’m going to ask you a question.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.440
And you have to answer.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.920
“Are you a student?”

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.920
“Are you a student?”

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.600
Well, you’re taking my class,&nbsp;
you’re learning English.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.360
So, “Yes, I am.”

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.400
Okay, you should say, “Yes, I am.”

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.040
But how about this one?

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.000
“Are you a monkey?”

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.560
“Are you a monkey?”

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.480
Of course the answer is “No, I’m not”.

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.720
“No, I’m not”.

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.840
Okay, let’s move on to the last part.

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.280
Now for this last part, we’re going to look
at some sentences,

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.120
but there’s something wrong&nbsp;
in all of these sentences.

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.440
So you have to find the mistakes.

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:40.080
The first sentence says, “I’m student”.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.080
Okay, look, “student”.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.760
There’s no ‘s’.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.920
That means just one.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.840
Just one.

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.480
So remember, if there’s just&nbsp;
one, we have to put ‘a’.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.960
“I’m a student.”

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.760
Let’s look at the next one.

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.400
“They are student”.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.000
Okay.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.640
This one says, “They are”.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.320
This means there is more than one.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.320
More than one student.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.840
So, what do we have to do?

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.800
We have to say “They are….

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.600
students”.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:22.960
We have to put an ‘s’ to show there’s
more than one student.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.800
“She aren’t a baby.”

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.040
“She.”

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.200
That’s one person.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.640
One girl or woman.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.960
“…a baby.”

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.320
That’s one person.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.240
But we put “aren’t”.

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.640
Now that’s wrong.

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:45.280
We have to say... ‘isn’t’.

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:50.000
“She isn’t a baby”.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.840
“You isn’t a cat”.

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.160
Now, for the subjective pronoun ‘you’,

00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.280
we have to have the ‘be’ verb ‘are’.

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:06.960
So not “You isn’t a cat”,&nbsp;
but “You aren’t... a cat”.

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.280
“You aren’t a cat.”

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:10.720
Okay.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.960
“Are it a cat?”

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.320
Okay.
“…a cat.”

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.840
That’s one animal.

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.080
So, do we need ‘are’?

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:24.000
No, we need the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.080
“Is it a cat?”

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.000
“Is it a cat?”

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.920
Okay, so that was the checkup for subjective
pronouns and ‘be’ verbs.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:37.520
I hope you guys understood and I’ll see
you in the next video.

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:45.840
Bye.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.480
Hi, everybody.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:55.200
In this video, we’re going to learn how to&nbsp;
make questions using ‘what’ and ‘be’ verbs.&nbsp;

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.760
Okay. Now when we have one thing,

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.720
we have to use the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.200
“What is it?”

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.640
“What is it?”

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.320
“It is a watch.”

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.840
“It is a watch.”

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.600
It’s one thing, so I have to say ‘a’.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.120
“a watch.”

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.680
I can also use the contraction for ‘it is’,

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:24.800
“it’s”.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.560
Okay, now listen.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.880
“It’s a ….”

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.320
“It’s a ….”

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.440
“It’s a watch.”

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.520
“It’s a watch.”

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.480
“What is it?”

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.080
“What is it?”

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.800
“It’s a marker.”

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.960
“It’s a marker.”

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.200
Okay.
Now, there are two highlighters.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.080
Okay, two.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.160
We use ‘are’.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.240
“What are they?”

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.960
“What are they?”

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.120
“They are highlighters.”

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.800
“They are highlighters.”

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.640
We have more than one, so we have to say “are”.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.240
And we have to put an ‘s’ at the end.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.680
Again, we can use a contraction for ‘they are’:

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.400
“they’re”.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.080
“They’re highlighters.”

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.440
“They’re highlighters.”

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.800
“What are they?”

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.440
“What are they?”

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.000
“They’re markers.”

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.560
“They’re markers.”

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.160
Okay.&nbsp;

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.560
We’re going to look at some examples&nbsp;
and I’m going to ask some questions.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.720
We please try to answer them.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.040
Listen carefully and answer with “It’s&nbsp;

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.400
a” or “They’re”.
Let’s look at the first one.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.080
“What is it?”

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:57.840
“What is it?”

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:02.080
“It’s a key.”

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.840
“It’s a key.”

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.000
“What are they?”

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.240
“What are they?”

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.400
“They’re keys.”

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.840
“They’re keys.”

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.440
“What is it?”

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:24.800
“What is it?”

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:26.960
“It’s a chair.”

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:30.880
“It’s a chair.”

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:32.620
“What are they?”

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:32.640
“What are they?”

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.560
“They’re chairs.”

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.640
“They’re chairs.”

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:43.760
“What is it?”

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.320
“What is it?”

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.120
“It’s a cat.”

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:07.292
“It’s a cat.”

01:03:07.292 --> 01:03:07.326
“What are they?”

01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:07.360
“What are they?”

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:07.913
“They’re cats.”

01:03:07.912 --> 01:03:08.312
“They’re cats.”

01:03:08.312 --> 01:03:08.636
“What is it?”

01:03:08.636 --> 01:03:08.960
“What is it?”

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.840
“It’s a house.”

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.240
“It’s a house.”

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.060
“What are they?”

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:16.080
“What are they?”

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.360
“They’re houses.”

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.600
“They’re houses.”

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.240
Now let’s focus on pronunciation

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.960
and saying these fast.
Okay.&nbsp;

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.920
English speakers speak very quickly,

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.000
so you have to practice as well.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.720
Okay.
“What is it?”&nbsp;

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.160
Okay, let’s try it faster three times.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:40.720
“What is it?”

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.280
“What is it?”

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:43.840
“What is it?”

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.520
It sounds like one word.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.680
Okay, and the answer is also very fast.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.240
“It’s a…”

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:51.680
“It’s a…”

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.120
“It’s a…”

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.487
“It’s a pencil.”

01:03:57.487 --> 01:03:57.508
“It’s a chair.”

01:03:57.508 --> 01:03:57.840
“It’s a marker.”

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.000
Okay.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.800
When we have more than one,&nbsp;
we say, “What are they?”.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.760
Let’s do it fast three times.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.400
“What are they?”

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.280
“What are they?”

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.640
“What are they?”

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.440
Okay.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.440
And when you answer.
“They’re…”&nbsp;

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.680
“They’re pencils”

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.440
“They’re chairs”

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.200
“They’re markers”

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.280
Okay, so this video was ‘what’ and ‘be’ verbs.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.320
I hope you understood, and&nbsp;
I’ll see you in the next video.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.120
Bye.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.560
Hi, everybody, and welcome.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.200
In this video, we’re going to talk about
‘this’ and ‘that’.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.120
Now ‘this’ and ‘that’ are used to talk about nouns

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.520
that are close to us, near or far away.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:56.640
Okay.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.080
So let’s look at the board.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.600
“This is a flower.”

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:10.160
Okay, we use ‘this’ to talk about&nbsp;
one noun, “a flower”, that is close.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.440
Okay.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.440
“This is a flower.”

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.560
It’s not far.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.280
It’s close.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.200
“That is a flower.”

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:25.680
Okay, we use ‘that’ to talk&nbsp;
about one noun that’s far away.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.640
So, “That… that is a flower”.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.480
Okay.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.840
For another example…

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.880
“This is a marker.”

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.640
It’s close to me.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.240
But “That… that is a marker”.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.520
It’s far away.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.560
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.960
So we know…

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.800
“This is a flower.”

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.240
Okay.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.080
And “That is a flower... that”.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.200
Now, “Is this a flower”?

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:02.800
“What is it?”

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.160
“It’s a chair.”

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.720
So we have to use the negative.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.360
“This isn’t a flower.”

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.440
It’s close by, but it isn’t a flower.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.840
‘isn’t’ is a contraction for ‘is not’.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:18.640
Okay.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.600
“This isn’t a flower.”

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.960
“This is a chair.”

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.960
“That isn’t a flower.”

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.840
It’s far away, so we say “that”.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.280
Again, we have ‘isn’t’, ‘a flower’.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.280
“That’s a chair.”

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.480
And let’s take another example.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.200
“This isn’t a pencil.”

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.680
“This is a marker.”

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:44.560
And…

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.600
“That isn’t a pencil.”

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.000
“That is a marker.”

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.960
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:59.760
Now we’re going to learn how to use
‘this’ and ‘that’ in a question.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.480
Okay.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.360
So we know, “This is a flower”.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.600
When we make a question, we have to switch.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.520
We put the ‘be’ verb first.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.160
So it becomes, “Is this a flower?”.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.440
Okay, it’s close by.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.440
So the answer is, “Yes, it is”.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:20.800
Okay.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.040
“Is that a flower?”

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.720
It’s far away.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.800
The answer is, “Yes, it is”.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.920
Okay, but how about this?

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.320
“This isn’t a flower.”
So...

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.880
“Is this a flower?”.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:47.760
The answer is, “No, it isn’t”.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:57.840
“Is that a flower?”

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.000
“No, it isn’t.”

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Okay, here.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.320
“Is this a marker?”.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.960
“Yes, it is.”

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.821
“Is that a marker?”.

01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:08.854
“Yes, it is.”

01:08:08.854 --> 01:08:09.839
“Is this a pencil?”.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.689
“No, it isn’t.”

01:08:11.689 --> 01:08:11.713
“Is that a pencil?”.

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:12.800
“No, it isn’t.”

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.200
Okay, so we learned ‘this’&nbsp;
and ‘that’ in this video.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.640
I hope you guys understand and&nbsp;
I’ll see you in the next video.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.840
Bye.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.040
Hi, everybody and welcome to this video.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.160
We’re going to talk about how&nbsp;
to use ‘these’ and ‘those’.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.280
Okay.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.120
Uhhh, just like we learned with ‘this’ and ‘that’,

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:50.320
we use ‘these’ and ‘those’ to talk&nbsp;
about nouns that are close to us

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.160
or far from us.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.440
Okay.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.280
So, let’s take a look at the board.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.760
Now, we know if there is just one,

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.440
and it’s close to us,

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.080
we say, “This is a flower”.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.600
Okay.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.440
But there’s more than one.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.400
It’s plural.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.720
So we have to say, “These”.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.000
“These are flowers.”

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.240
Again, more than one.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.560
Now, I change the ‘be’ verb to ‘are’

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.960
and I added an ‘s’ at the end of ‘flower’.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.640
So, “These are flowers.”

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.320
Okay.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.960
Now, there’s one that’s far away.

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.640
We say, “That is a flower.”

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.840
But, again, there’s more than one.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.520
There are two flowers.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:46.240
So, in that case, we use, “Those are flowers.”

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.440
“Those are flowers.”

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.400
They’re far away.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.280
“Those are flowers.”

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.800
Let’s look at these.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.760
“This is a marker.”

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.840
“These are markers.”

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.440
“That is a marker.”

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.600
“Those are markers.”

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.360
Okay.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.040
Let’s move on to the next part.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.880
So we know “These are flowers”.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.480
They’re close by.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.360
And for the flowers that are far away, we say,

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.800
“Those are flowers”.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:25.920
Okay.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.920
But over here we have ‘chairs’.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.400
So, we have to use the negative.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.680
Okay.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.920
We use the contraction ‘aren’t’

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.800
which is short for ‘are not’.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.240
“These aren’t flowers.”

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.920
“These aren’t flowers.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.000
Okay, and for the chairs that are far away,

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.040
we say, “Those aren’t flowers”.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:57.760
“Those aren’t flowers.”

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.680
Okay, and let’s try with the markers.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.800
“These aren’t pens.”

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.680
“These aren’t pens.”

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.960
Okay, and far away.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.480
“Those aren’t pens.”

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.600
“Those aren’t pens.”

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.600
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.600
Okay, now we’re going to make some questions.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:26.240
We know, “These are flowers”.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.680
When you want to make a&nbsp;
question, you have to change

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.200
‘these are’ and put the ‘be’ verb first.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.320
So, it becomes, “Are these flowers?”.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.600
“Are these flowers?”

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.480
And the answer is “Yes, they are.”

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.160
Okay, now the flowers are far away.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.960
So we say, “Are those flowers?”.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.680
“Are those flowers?”

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.120
And again, the answer is “Yes, they are.”

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.480
Okay. Now here, we have chairs.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.280
“Are these flowers?”

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.120
The answer is “No, they aren’t.”

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.880
Okay, now they’re far away.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.040
“Are those flowers?”

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.040
And again, the answer is “No, they aren’t.”

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.440
How about these? “Are these markers?”

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.360
“Yes, they are.”

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.720
“Are those markers?”

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.480
“Yes, they are.”

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.480
“Are these pens?”

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:38.292
“No, they aren’t.”

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:38.313
“Are those pens?”

01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:39.600
“No, they aren’t.”

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:44.880
Okay, so in this video, we learned&nbsp;
how to use ‘these’ and ‘those’.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.480
I hope you guys understand and I’ll see
you in the next video.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.840
Bye.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.200
Let’s do some practice with
‘this’, ‘that’,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.240
‘these’, and ‘those’.
First, I have this pen.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.840
I have to say, “This is a pen.”

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.400
“This is a pen.”

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.000
Okay.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.840
Over there, “That is a pen.”

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.840
“That is a pen.”

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.000
Now, I have two pens.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.560
“These are pens.”

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.200
“These are pens.”

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.400
Okay, I’m going to move them far away.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.120
“Those are pens.”

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.600
“Those are pens.”

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.120
Okay, let’s move on to questions.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.840
I have one pen.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:51.760
“Is this a pen?”

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.110
“Yes, it is.”

01:13:54.110 --> 01:14:02.800
“Is this a cookie?”

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.912
“No, it isn’t.”

01:14:04.912 --> 01:14:04.932
“Is that a pen?”

01:14:04.932 --> 01:14:05.203
“Yes, it is.”

01:14:05.203 --> 01:14:05.829
“Is that a cookie?”

01:14:05.829 --> 01:14:06.400
“No, it isn’t.”

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.920
Okay, two pens.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.480
“Are these pens?”

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.920
“Yes, they are.”

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.440
“Are these cookies?”

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.680
“No, they aren’t.”

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.360
Okay, now they’re over here.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.600
“Are those pens?”

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.840
Yes, they are?”

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.480
“Are those cookies?”

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.640
“No, they aren’t.”

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.840
Okay, so that was our practice

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.960
for ‘this’, ‘that’, ‘these’, and ‘those’.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.720
I hope you guys understood and&nbsp;
I’ll see you in the next video.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.840
Bye.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.520
Hi, everybody.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.840
In this video, we’re going to&nbsp;
learn about possessive adjectives.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.520
We use possessive adjectives to show that
something belongs to me,

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.560
or something belongs to someone else.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.600
I own something or someone owns something.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.320
Okay.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.000
So let’s take a look at the board.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.240
Now last time we learned about subjective pronouns

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.360
and here they are.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.720
‘I’, ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’, ‘you’, ‘we’, ‘they’.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:27.520
And here are the possessive adjectives.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.120
Okay.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:29.360
‘My’.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.440
We use ‘my’ to show that something belongs to me.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:34.640
Okay.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.240
‘His’.

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.360
This means that something belongs to one man
or one boy.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.120
‘Her’.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.280
We use that to show something belongs to one
woman or one girl.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:51.840
‘Its’.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.200
We use ‘its’ to show that something belongs
to an animal.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.040
We use ‘your’ to show that&nbsp;
something belongs to you.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.080
Okay.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:05.760
‘Our’.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:13.520
‘Our’ means that something belongs to
me and you or me and somebody else.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.920
Okay, or me and other people.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.240
Okay, and last.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.040
We use ‘their’ to show that something
belongs to many people.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.360
Okay, not me, but many people.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.960
Okay, now I want you to pay&nbsp;
attention to three special words.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.440
‘Its’, ‘your’ and ‘their’.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.800
Now I want you to notice these words sound
like other words.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.480
So you have to be careful&nbsp;
not to get them confused.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.000
And I’m going to explain.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.400
‘Its’ sounds like the contraction for
‘it is’; ‘it’s’.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.440
Okay, so, don’t get that confused.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.640
‘Your’ sounds like the contraction for
‘you are’ ‘you’re’.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.360
Okay.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:05.520
So make sure you use this one to show possession.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.240
Okay.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.280
And the last word, ‘their’, it actually
sounds like two other words.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.120
The contraction for ‘they are’ ‘they’re’

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.760
or the word t-h-e-r-e, the&nbsp;
other word ‘there’. Okay.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.240
So please don’t get those confused.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.000
Now I know all of this sounds very hard,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.280
but if you practice with me,&nbsp;
I’m sure you’ll understand.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.200
So let’s move on to the next part.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.440
Okay, let’s practice together.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.080
Now, here I have a marker.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.200
It belongs to me.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.920
So, I have to say, “This is my marker.”

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.520
“This isn’t your marker.”

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.280
“This is my marker.”

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.560
Okay, let’s look at this boy.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.560
He has a hat.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.800
So, I have to say, “This is his hat.”

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.200
“This is his hat.”

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.680
“This isn’t my hat.”

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.920
“This isn’t your hat.”

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.080
Okay.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.840
And this girl has a dress.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.800
So, “This is her dress.”

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.880
“This is her dress.”

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.600
“This isn’t my dress.”

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.360
“This isn’t your dress.”

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:28.560
Okay, in this picture there’s an animal;
a dog…and it has a ball.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.040
I have to say, “This is its ball.”

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.160
“This is its ball.”

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.120
“This isn’t my ball.”

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.600
and “This isn’t your ball.”

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.320
Now, in this picture, we have two people.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.880
Okay, and they both own this house.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.320
So, “This is their house.”

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.200
“This is their house.”

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.920
Okay, now a little bit farther away, we have
three books.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.800
Okay.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.640
And this boy and girl have the books here.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.800
So, we have to say “those”.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.080
And because we have more than one,

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.920
we have to use ‘are’.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.400
Okay.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:22.560
“Those are their books.”

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:24.643
“Those are their books.”

01:19:24.643 --> 01:19:26.560
“Those aren’t my books.”

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.680
“Those aren’t your books.”

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.520
Okay.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.040
And the last one.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.120
Here’s the county Korea.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.280
Okay, we all live here.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.880
So we say, “This is our country.”

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.840
“This is our country.”

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:50.080
Okay, let’s move on to the next&nbsp;
part for some more practice.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.480
Here are some practice sentences.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.840
We’re going to put possessive&nbsp;
adjectives on these lines.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.280
Okay.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.600
So, let’s try together.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.000
“I put candy in ____ mouth.”

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.280
Okay, this is a mouth.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.120
“I put candy in ……”

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.080
What should we put?

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.640
“my mouth.”

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Okay, next.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:18.480
“John.”

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.680
John is one man or boy.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.880
“John lost ____ bag.”

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:30.160
Okay, for one man or boy, we say, “his”.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.760
“John lost his bag.”

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.960
Okay, “The parents…”

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.240
That’s more than one person. That’s two people.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.520
So, “The parents love ____ baby.”

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.840
We have to put…

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:50.720
“their”.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.640
“The parents love their baby.”

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.160
Okay. And here, “The dog…”

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.800
Okay, ‘the dog’ is an animal.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.640
So, “The dog eats ____ food.”

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.240
What do we put?

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.440
We have to say, “its”.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.120
“The dog eats its food.”

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:16.240
Okay, let’s look at some more examples.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.280
Let’s continue.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.760
“_____ names are Paul and Sam.”

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.800
Okay, we have two people, Paul, and Sam.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.640
And the plural names.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.720
So we have to say, “Their”.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.800
“Their names are Paul and Sam.”

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.160
Okay.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.800
“Can I use ____ phone?”

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.960
Okay, I’m asking you.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:50.080
So I have to say, “Can I use… your phone?”

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:51.440
Okay.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.840
And the next one. “_____ make-up looks good.”

01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:02.160
Whose make-up? Well, usually&nbsp;
girls or women wear make-up.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.360
So, I’m going to say,

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.800
“Her make-up looks good.”

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.480
Okay, and…

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:14.320
“_____ videos are helpful to you.”

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.920
Okay, these are the videos that we make. Right?

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.080
We teach English in these videos.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:24.320
So, the answer is “our”.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.120
“Our videos are helpful to you.”

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.440
Or we sure hope they are.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:34.720
Okay, so in this video, we learned&nbsp;
how to use possessive adjectives.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.560
Don’t forget you have to&nbsp;
put a noun after each one.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.880
I hope you understand, and I hope to see you
in the next video.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:51.840
Bye.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.040
Hi, everybody and welcome.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.440
In this video, we’re going to learn about
possessive pronouns.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:22:59.680
Okay.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.720
And we use possessive pronouns to show that
something belongs to us

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.600
or something is owned by us.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.440
Okay, or someone else.

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.280
So, let’s take a look at the board.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:16.320
Now, last time we learned&nbsp;
about subjective pronouns.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.920
And here they are.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.200
Okay.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:23.360
And in another video, we talked&nbsp;
about possessive adjectives.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.280
And here they are.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:26.560
Okay.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:32.080
And over here are the possessive pronouns
that we’re going to talk about in this video.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:36.960
Now, possessive adjectives and possessive
pronouns are the same.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.200
They show possession.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.760
Which means, I own something.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.360
Something belongs to me…or to someone else.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.000
Okay.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.160
The only difference is that they’re used
a little differently.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:56.080
For possessive adjectives, you have to put
a noun after.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:56.640
Okay.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:57.520
“My dog.”

01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:58.640
Okay.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:04.160
But for possessive pronouns, you don’t have
to put a noun after it.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.080
Okay, you can just say “mine”.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:07.360
Okay.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.960
So let’s go through each one.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:10.560
“My"

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.080
"Mine”

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:13.360
Okay.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.440
And this is the same.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:15.840
“His"

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:16.960
"His”

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:18.960
Okay.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.680
For ‘her’, we say “hers”.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.120
We add an ‘s’.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:23.600
“Hers”

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.280
“Its"

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:25.680
"Its”

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.920
Again, it’s the same.

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.320
“Your"

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.000
"Yours”

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.360
We have to put an ‘s’.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:33.920
“Yours”

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:35.440
“Our"

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.800
"Ours”
and “Their"

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.080
"Theirs”

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:46.000
Okay, again, I know that this can be really
confusing, but let’s practice some more.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.480
Okay.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.280
And let’s move on to the next part.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.880
Okay, let’s practice together.

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.200
Now, “This is my marker.”

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.440
But with possessive pronouns, you do not have
to put a noun after.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.320
Okay, so I can say, “This is mine.”

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.960
“This isn’t yours.”

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.920
“This is mine.”

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.920
Okay, let’s look at the board.

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.320
This boy has a hat.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.800
So we say, “This is his.”

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.186
“This isn’t mine.”

01:25:16.186 --> 01:25:16.719
“This isn’t yours.”

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.480
“This is his.”

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.520
The girl has a dress.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.680
“This is hers.”

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:26.907
“This isn’t mine.”

01:25:26.907 --> 01:25:28.000
“This isn’t yours.”

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.040
“This is hers.”

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:30.080
Okay.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.160
Now with ‘its’, it’s kind of different.

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:34.800
Okay.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.360
You still have to put a noun,

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.840
so you can’t say, “This is its.”

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.960
You have to say, “This is its ball.”

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.000
Again, “This is its ball.”

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:48.907
“This isn’t mine.”

01:25:48.907 --> 01:25:50.000
“This isn’t yours.”

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.360
“This is its ball.”

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:52.960
Okay.

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.120
Now we have two people who have a house.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.200
“This is theirs.”

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:00.826
“This isn’t mine.”

01:26:00.826 --> 01:26:01.439
“This isn’t yours.”

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.040
“This is theirs.”

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:04.720
Okay.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.560
Now over here, we have some books and we’re
going to say that they belong to these two people.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.280
Okay.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.720
So we’re going to use the plural ‘be’ verb; ‘are’.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:15.520
Okay.

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.720
“These are theirs.”

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.320
“These aren’t mine.”

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.520
“These aren’t yours.”

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.640
“These are theirs.”

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.320
Okay.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.520
And last, we have a picture of Korea.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:31.840
Okay.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.320
“This is ours.”

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.720
“This is ours.”

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.680
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.480
Okay, let’s look at these examples.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.760
We have to put in some possessive pronouns.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.080
Okay.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.600
“That lipstick is _____.”

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:58.240
Okay, well we have the noun ‘lipstick’
and usually a girl or woman wears lipstick,

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:04.240
so we’re going to use the possessive pronoun
‘hers’.

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:04.560
Okay.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.600
“That lipstick is hers.”

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.120
Okay.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.160
The next sentence.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.840
“That sports car is _____.”

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.320
Okay.

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.680
Again, usually a man will drive a sports car.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:27.760
So, we can say, “That sports car is his.”

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.600
Okay.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.840
Now, let’s look at these last two.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.320
“This money is mine, not yours.”

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.920
“This money is mine; it belongs to me.”

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.320
“It doesn’t belong to you.”

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.080
Not yours.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.280
Okay.

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.480
And the last one.

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.400
“Dokdo is ours.”

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.840
It’s Koreas.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.080
Right…

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.840
“Not theirs.”

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.440
Not Japan’s.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.760
“It belongs to us.”

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.440
So we say, “It’s ours.”

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.400
Okay, so in this video, we&nbsp;
learned possessive pronouns.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.000
I hope you understand, and I’ll see you
in the next video.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.840
Bye.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.920
This is a checkup for ‘this’,&nbsp;
‘that’, ‘these’, ‘those’,

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.080
possessive adjectives, and possessive pronouns.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.360
Okay.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:31.600
Now here, I want you to focus on ‘this’,
‘that’, ‘these’, and ‘those’.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.960
Okay, so here’s the first example.

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:36.960
We have a dog.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.480
One dog.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.440
So we have to use ‘this’ or ‘that’.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.160
Okay.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.240
If it’s close, I say, “This is a dog.”

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.440
If it’s far away, I say, “That is a dog.”

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.440
So, I’m going to write ‘this’.

01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.040
Okay.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.040
The next one says, “…are balloons.”

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.480
“…are balloons.” With an ‘s’.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.320
There’s more than one.

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.440
So can we use ‘this’ or ‘that’?

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:12.480
No.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:16.080
We have to use ‘these’ or ‘those’.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.280
So, if it’s close, I say “These are balloons.”

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.000
If they are far, “Those are balloons.”

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.440
Okay.

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.200
So let’s write ‘those’.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.440
“Those are balloons.”

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.280
Okay.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.080
Now when we ask the question,

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.840
“Are these pens?”

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.640
we have more than one.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.160
“These pens.” With an ‘s’.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:47.360
Okay.

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:50.320
I can put two answers here.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.360
“No, ___ aren’t.”

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.946
I can say “No, these aren’t.”

01:30:00.946 --> 01:30:05.840
Or… I can say “No, they..."&nbsp;
more than one "... they aren’t.”

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:08.080
Okay.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.960
The next one. “These ____ eyes.”

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.520
We need a ‘be’ verb.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:16.480
Okay.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.120
There’s more than one, right.

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.400
There are two eyes.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.960
So, “These are eyes.”

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.880
Okay.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.440
And here “…is a nose.”

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:30.720
One.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:32.800
A nose.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:33.840
And it’s close.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.760
So, I have to say, “This is a nose.”

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.720
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.560
We’re going to do some more checkup.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:52.560
Now here, I want you to focus on possessive
adjectives and possessive pronouns.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.880
Let’s look at the first example.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.840
“These are my pen.”

01:30:58.960 --> 01:30:59.440
Okay.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:03.360
We have ‘these…are’.

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:07.280
This means we need more than one.

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.000
Right…

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.200
More than one pen.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.760
So, we have to put ‘s’.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.480
“These are my pens.”

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.320
Okay.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.400
Let’s look at these two together.

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.160
“Those aren’t her children.”

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:24.560
Okay.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:28.760
So we can also say, “Those aren’t ____.”

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.440
What do we put?

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.400
“… her children.”

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:36.960
We can always say, “Those aren’t hers.”

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.560
Okay.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.480
We don’t need a noun here.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.160
We do need a noun over here, though.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:44.640
Okay.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.760
Then, “Is it yours?”

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:49.680
“Is it yours?”

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.680
“Yes, it’s _____.”

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.480
There’s no noun.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.840
We have to say…

01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.200
“mine”.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:00.800
“Is it yours?”

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.720
“Yes, it’s mine.”

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:04.720
Okay.

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.760
And the last two…

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:09.520
” _____ these his shoes?”

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.480
We need a ‘be’ verb here.

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.800
” _____ these his shoes?”

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.680
We have ‘these’, and we have ‘shoes’ with an ‘s’.

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.400
So we need the plural ‘be’ verb.

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.280
“Are”.
“Are these his shoes?”

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:28.800
Okay.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:31.200
And the answer. “No, they…”

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.040
Plural.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:34.960
“…are.”

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:39.840
We have ‘no’. “No, they aren’t”

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:41.360
Okay.

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:42.640
“Are not, aren’t”.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.000
Okay.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.760
Let’s move on to the next part.

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:50.560
For this last part, we’re going to look
at these sentences.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.440
But they’re all wrong.

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.440
They all have mistakes.

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:58.560
So you have to find the mistakes for me.

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.240
Okay.

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:04.080
So, the first one says, “That are chairs.”

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.720
Hmmmm, we know that’s wrong.

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:11.120
‘That’ is used for singular nouns.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:11.440
One.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:17.280
But it says “are” and it says “chairs”
with an ‘s’.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.320
So, we have to change this word.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:27.120
We can say, “These are chairs.”

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.360
or “Those are chairs.”

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:30.800
Okay.

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.440
“This book is my.”

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.600
Hmm.

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.080
We have the possessive pronoun ‘my’.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:42.960
But remember, you have to have a noun after,

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.400
but there’s no noun.

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:51.440
So, we can change this to the&nbsp;
possessive adjective ‘mine’.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:52.880
Okay.

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.840
You don’t need a noun if you say ‘mine’.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:57.760
Okay.

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.640
“That is he house.”

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.120
Hmm.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:09.280
We want to show that this house belongs to
this man or boy.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.800
“That is he house.”

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.600
But this word ‘he’, does not show possession.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.000
Okay.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.080
So, we say, “This is his house.”

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.280
‘His’, then the noun ‘house’.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360
Similarly, for the next one.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.840
“She name is Jenny.”

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.880
We want to show that this name belongs to Jenny.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.880
So, we say…

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:41.440
“her”.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.920
“Her name is Jenny.”

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.880
Okay, and the last one is also similar.

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.440
“It’s ours house.”

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.840
Now, if we don’t have ‘house’, “It’s ours.”

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.920
We can say that.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:01.440
But since we have a noun, …

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.240
we use the possessive pronoun,

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.000
“It’s ‘our’ house.”

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:07.760
Okay.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:12.960
That was the checkup for possessive&nbsp;
pronouns, possessive adjectives,

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.360
‘this’, ‘that’, ‘these’, and ‘those’.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.560
I hope you understood, and I’ll see you
in the next video.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:28.240
Bye.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.680
Hi, everybody.

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:36.000
In this video, we’re going to talk about
the articles; ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:42.240
Now this can be very confusing, so please
make sure you pay careful attention.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:46.880
We use articles in front of nouns.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.000
Okay, so remember that and&nbsp;
let’s look at the board.

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:57.280
First, we use ‘a’ or ‘an’ when we’re
talking about any one thing.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:04.240
For example, let’s say I&nbsp;
say, “A banana is delicious.”

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.800
Okay, that means all bananas.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.840
Any banana is delicious.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.080
“A banana is delicious.”

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.360
Okay, let’s jump over here.

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.560
If I’m talking about a specific banana…

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.640
maybe I have a banana in my hand.

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.560
It’s specific, not any banana, this one.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.120
I have to use ‘the’,

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.400
“The banana is old.”

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:32.800
Okay. This one.

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.040
I can’t say, “A banana is old.”

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.760
Then that means all bananas are old.

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.720
And that’s not true. Just this one.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.520
So, I say, “The banana is old.”

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.320
Okay, let’s move over here.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:54.800
We also use ‘a’ or ‘an’ when we’re
talking about something for the first time.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.760
So, I have another example here.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.400
“I watched a movie.”

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:01.840
Okay.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:08.480
I’m talking about this movie for the first
time, so I have to use “…a movie”.

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.280
But, if I want to talk about this movie again,

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.840
for the second time, or the&nbsp;
third time or fourth, fifth…

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.720
it doesn’t matter.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.960
I have to use ‘the’.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.400
“The movie was fun.”

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.520
I’m talking about this one. The specific.

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.240
“The movie was fun.”

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:34.400
I can’t say, “A movie was fun.”

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.480
That means all movies are fun.

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.280
That’s not true.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.760
“The movie was fun.”

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.920
Okay, and I also use ‘the’

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.840
when I’m talking about a noun&nbsp;
where there’s only one and only.

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.280
Okay.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.720
For example, there’s only one sun.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:56.320
Okay, when I look at the&nbsp;
sky, there’s only one sun.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.160
So, I say, “The sun.”

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.720
“The sun is hot.”

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.960
I cannot say, “A sun.”

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.160
That’s wrong.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.600
When there’s one and only, we say, “The sun.”

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:08.960
Okay.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.560
Let’s look at some more examples.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.840
The first example says, “A lion is dangerous.”

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.600
I have to use ‘a’ because I’m&nbsp;
talking about any one lion.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.440
Any lion is dangerous.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.320
All lions are dangerous.

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.840
So, I use ‘a’.

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.240
The next sentence says, “It’s a dog.”

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:39.280
I’m talking about this dog for the first time,
so I use ‘a’.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.120
Now, I’m talking about this&nbsp;
dog for the second time.

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.560
So, I say, “The dog is cute.”

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.400
Okay.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.240
Here’s a similar example.

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.080
“It’s an ant.”

01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:00.400
Well, I used ‘an’ because we have ‘ant’,
which start with a vowel.

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.160
And I’m talking about this ant for the first
time.

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.240
“It’s an ant.”

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.920
Now, I’m talking about this ant again.

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.800
“The ant is small.”

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.960
“The ant…”, this one, “…is small.”

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.000
Okay, and the last one.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.440
“It’s the moon.”

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:26.320
I have to say, “the moon”&nbsp;
because there’s only one moon.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.120
I cannot say, “a moon”.

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.600
“It’s the moon.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:36.000
The moon…”, only one, “…is round.”

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:37.840
Okay.

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.840
Let’s look at some more examples.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.480
Okay, we have some more examples,

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:50.800
but this time I want you to think about&nbsp;
whether we should put ‘a’, ‘an’ or ‘the’.

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:52.240
Okay.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.480
So, “I see ____ desk and ___ chair.”

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:00.720
We don’t know which desk and chair.

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.920
And it’s the first time I’m talking about them.

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.840
So, we have to put ‘a’.

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:13.040
“I see a desk and a chair.”

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.680
The next one.

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.600
“I see ____ octopus.”

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.480
Okay, this is the same.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.560
It’s the first time I’m&nbsp;
talking about this octopus.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.680
So, do I put ‘a’ or ‘an’?

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:31.120
Well here we have the vowel ‘o’.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.720
So we have to put “‘an’ octopus”.

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.440
“I see an octopus.”

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.640
Okay, the next one.

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:41.680
“It’s ___ pen.”

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.240
Okay, it’s the same.

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:47.280
It’s the first time, so I say, “a pen”.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.920
Now, I’m talking about the&nbsp;
pen for the second time.

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:57.840
So I say, “The pen is red.”

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.640
Okay, I’m talking about this one.

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.600
So I say, “the”.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.320
Okay, similarly…

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.320
“She is ____ girl.”

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.080
What do I say?

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.880
“a girl.”

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:13.440
We’re talking about her for the first time.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:14.720
Okay.

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.120
And now we’re talking about this girl again,
for the second time.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:23.440
So, I have to say, “The girl is pretty.”

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.320
And the last example.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.280
“I can see ___ sky.”

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.720
Now, we only have one sky.

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:33.840
Right…

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.960
So, if there’s only one and only, we have
to put the article ‘the’.

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.400
“I can see the sky.”

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.560
Okay.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:50.080
So in this video, we talked about the articles
‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’.

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.280
I hope you understand, and&nbsp;
I’ll see you in the next video.

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:59.840
Bye.

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.480
Hi, everybody.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.720
In this video, we’re going to talk about
the prepositions: in, on and under.

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.200
Now, we use prepositions to&nbsp;
show ‘where’ something is.

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.600
So, let’s take a look at the board.

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.640
Okay, now in this picture, we have a cat.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:28.160
Okay, and we’re talking about this specific
cat, so we have to say, “the cat”.

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.280
Okay.
“…is in the box.”

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:31.840
Okay.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.360
The preposition is ‘in’.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
“He’s ‘in’ the box.”
“…’in’ the box.”

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:39.600
Okay.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.720
And the next one.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.360
“The cat is on…”

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.760
The preposition ‘on’… “the chair”.

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.240
“He’s on the chair.”

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.000
Okay.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.200
And the next one.

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:53.520
“The cat is ‘under’…

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.240
’under’ the table.”

01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:58.720
“…’under’ the table.”

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.800
Okay.

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.160
Let’s look at the next one.

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.800
Now we have plural nouns.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.280
“The apples ‘are’…”

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.840
Okay.
“…in the box.”

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.280
Again, the apples are “…’in’ the box.”

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:14.560
Okay.

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.720
Next, “The apples are ‘on’ the chair.”

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:21.280
And last.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.680
“The apples are ‘under’….’under’ the table.”

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:29.160
Okay, let’s look at some more examples.

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:34.320
Okay, let’s look at some pictures to help
us understand the prepositions:

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.720
in, on, and under.

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.880
I’m going to ask you some questions.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.080
I want you to think about&nbsp;
which one you should use.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:43.200
Okay.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.320
“Where is the dog?”

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.840
“Where is the dog?”

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:56.160
“The dog is ‘in’ the doghouse.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.080
You should use the preposition ‘in’.

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:03.760
“The dog is ‘in’ the doghouse.

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:07.040
“Where is the man?”

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.680
“Where is the man?”

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.040
“The man is ‘under’ the umbrella.”

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.640
“The man is ‘under’ the umbrella.”

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:23.280
And last.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.000
“Where are the girls?”

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.880
“Where are the girls?”

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.520
“The girls are ‘on’ the bridge.”

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:39.760
“The girls are ‘on’ the bridge.”

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:41.440
Okay.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:43.040
Let’s look at some more examples.

01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:52.080
Now, we’re going to practice asking and
answering questions using: in, on and under.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.280
First, let’s take a look at this picture.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:02.880
Here we have a rabbit, a chair&nbsp;
and one, two, three snakes.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.000
Okay.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.000
So, I will ask a question using in, on or under.

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.240
I want you to think.

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:15.280
Is the answer, “Yes, it is.”

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.520
or “No, it isn’t.”

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:17.760
Okay.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:20.240
Let’s start with the rabbit.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:25.200
“Is the rabbit under the chair?”

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:29.840
“No, it isn’t.”

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:35.280
“Is the rabbit in the chair?”

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.080
“No, it isn’t.”

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:46.720
“Is the rabbit on the chair?”
“…on the chair?”

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.360
“Yes, it is.”

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:51.680
Okay.

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:54.480
Now, we’re going to move on to the snakes.

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:59.840
Now, there are…there are more than one,
right, so it’s plural, so we say,

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:02.640
“Are the snakes…” with an ‘s’.

01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:03.600
Okay.

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.880
So again, think.

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:07.440
Is the answer, “Yes, they are.”

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.440
or “No, they aren’t.”

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.400
“Are the snakes in the chair?”

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.920
“No, they aren’t.”

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.840
“Are the snakes on the chair?”

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.080
“No, they aren’t.”

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.960
“Are the snakes under the chair?”

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.320
“Yes, they are.”

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.880
Okay, how did you do?

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:44.160
I hope you guys understand how to use the&nbsp;

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.200
prepositions; in, on and under&nbsp;
after watching this video.

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:51.360
Thanks for joining and I’ll see you next time.

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.840
Bye.

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.320
Hi, everybody.

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.920
In this video, we’re going&nbsp;
to talk about adjectives.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.720
Now, we use adjectives to&nbsp;
describe nouns or things.

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:19.200
Okay, we can describe its size, its color,
its shape or other things like that.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:19.520
Okay.

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.080
So let’s take a look at the board.

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:24.960
The first noun we’re going to use is ‘marker’.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:26.960
“It’s a marker.”

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.160
Now, I want to use an adjective&nbsp;
to describe the color.

01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:36.320
I'm going to say, “It’s a ‘black’ marker.”

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.880
‘Black’ is the adjective.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:48.480
Now notice, I have to put the adjective after
the article ‘a’, but before the noun ‘marker’.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.360
“It’s a black marker.”

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.160
Now, I can use another&nbsp;
adjective to describe its size.

01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:58.560
“It’s a long marker.”

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.080
Okay.

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.920
Let’s try the next one.

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:03.680
Here we have a bird.

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.200
So, “It’s a bird.”

01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:06.960
Okay.

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.800
I want to use another adjective&nbsp;
to describe the color.

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:14.480
So, I’m going to say, “It’s a blue bird.”

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.280
Again, you have to put the adjective after
the article, before the noun.

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.720
I can also describe its size.

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.720
“It’s a small bird.”

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:30.080
‘Small’ is another adjective.

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:35.040
Now, at the last part, we have some apples.

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.400
Three apples.

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.160
Okay, remember, when we have more than one
noun, it’s called a plural noun.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:48.409
So, we have to say, “They’re apples.”,
with an ‘s’.

01:48:48.408 --> 01:48:48.880
“They’re apples.”

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:54.400
I want to use the adjective ‘red’ to describe
the color of these apples.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.560
So, I’m going to say, “They’re red apples.”

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:00.080
Okay.

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.240
Here, there’s no article.

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:03.680
There’s no ‘a’.

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.440
That’s because there’s more than one.

01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:08.080
“They’re red apples.”

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:14.080
So, I just have to put the adjective before
the noun that it’s describing.

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.160
“They’re red apples.”

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:19.200
Okay, let’s move on to some more examples.

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:25.760
Okay. Now we’re going to&nbsp;
practice asking and answering&nbsp;

01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.840
questions using adjectives.

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:29.120
Okay.

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.400
So, we have a man here.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.080
I want to ask, “Is he a small man?”

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.680
Okay.

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.840
We have the adjective ‘small’.

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:43.520
Notice, even in a question,

01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:48.800
we have to put the adjective after&nbsp;
the article and before the noun.

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:51.200
“Is he a small man?”

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:53.920
Well, let’s take a look at this picture.

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.840
The answer is, “No, he’s a _____ man.”

01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:02.160
We need another adjective.

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:05.120
He’s not a small man.

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.840
So, we have to say “No, he’s a…

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:12.800
big man.”

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:13.280
Okay.

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.280
We’re going to use the adjective ‘big’.

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:17.840
Okay, let’s look at the next one.

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.800
“Is it a _____ table?”

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:24.400
The answer is “Yes, it is.”

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:31.520
We need an adjective to describe color, shape
or size or something.

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.200
Well, we can’t really describe the color.

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.920
So, I think we should try the shape.

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:38.320
Okay.

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.640
Well, “Is it a….

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:44.320
round table?”

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.760
And the answer is “Yes, it is.”

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:51.840
Okay, and last, we have two dresses.

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.040
Okay. So that means the noun is plural.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.520
In that case, for the&nbsp;
questions, we begin with ‘are’.

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:02.640
“Are they red dresses?”

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.160
Okay, the adjective is ‘red’.

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:08.400
But, “Are they red dresses?”

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:11.040
“No, they’re…

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.840
blue dresses.”

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.040
Okay.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:18.000
“No, they’re…blue dresses.”

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.600
Okay.

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.320
So, in this video, we learned about adjectives.

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.000
I hope you guys understand.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
And I’ll see you in the next video.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:33.840
Bye.

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:41.520
This is a check-up video for articles,&nbsp;
prepositions, and adjectives.

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:44.160
I’ve written some sentences on the board.

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.840
Let’s try to finish them together.

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:48.240
Okay.

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:52.640
The first sentence says, “It’s __ ___umbrella.”

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:54.080
Okay.

01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.600
We have the noun.

01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.320
We need an article and an&nbsp;
adjective to describe the umbrella.

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:00.960
Okay.

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:01.840
So here it is.

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.560
Let’s describe the color.

01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:05.440
Okay.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.680
We would say ‘black’.

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.720
Remember, the adjective comes before the noun.

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:16.240
Now we need an article.

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:17.920
And the correct article is ‘a’.

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.480
“It’s a black umbrella.”

01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:21.920
Okay.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:25.120
Next, “It’s ___ ___ ___.”

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.400
We have three blanks.

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.680
Here, we have the noun ‘ant’.

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:32.880
So, we’re going to put that at the end.

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:34.400
Okay.

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.560
Let’s use the adjective ugly.

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:37.920
Okay.

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:42.400
Remember, again, the adjective&nbsp;
comes before the noun.

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.160
“…ugly ant.”

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:45.760
“It’s __ ugly ant.”

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:47.680
We need an article.

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.480
Should we use ‘a’ or ‘an’?

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.480
Well, ‘ugly’ starts with the vowel ‘u’,
so we have to say ‘an’.

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.040
“It’s an ugly ant.”

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:01.600
Next.

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:03.840
“It’s __ __ __.”

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:04.400
Okay.

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.320
We have the noun ‘car’.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.960
So, we put that at the end.

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:14.080
Again, let’s use an adjective&nbsp;
that describes the color.

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.240
Let’s use ‘blue’.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:18.640
Okay.

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.880
What article should we use?

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.280
We have to say “a”.

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.840
“It’s a blue car.”

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:27.840
Okay, and last.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:30.960
“I __ ___ nice girl.”

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:31.520
That’s me.

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:35.840
We have the noun ‘girl’…and the adjective ‘nice’.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.000
So, we need the article.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.840
We’re going to say “a”.

01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:42.720
Now, we’re missing one more thing.

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.360
We need the ‘be’ verb ‘am’.

01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:48.080
“I am a nice girl.”

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.280
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.560
Okay, let’s continue with the checkup.

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:56.640
Here’s a picture.

01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:57.120
Okay.

01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.320
Look at it carefully.

01:53:59.120 --> 01:53:59.760
“What is it?”

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:02.160
“What is it?”

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.440
“It’s __ banana.”

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:07.840
We need an article here.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:14.400
And it’s the first time I’m talking about
this, so we’re going to say “a”.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:16.800
“It’s a banana.”

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.480
“Where is ___ banana?”

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:25.760
Now, you know, I’m talking about this one.

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.040
It’s specific.

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.640
So, I’m going to use the article ‘the’.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.080
“Where is the banana?”

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:39.200
Okay. And now, let’s think about the preposition.

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.840
“It’s __ the chair.”

01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.520
We need to use the preposition ‘on’.

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.640
“It’s on the chair.”

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:52.320
Okay.

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:53.680
Let’s move on.

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:55.040
“What are they?”

01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:57.040
Okay.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.800
“They’re ____ oranges.”

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:02.240
Okay.

01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.840
We have more than one.

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:09.280
That’s why we said, “They are…they’re”
and “oranges” …with an ‘s’.

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:10.480
Okay.

01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.400
Can we use ‘the’?

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:20.240
No, you don’t know what oranges I’m talking
about because it’s the first time I said

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.520
anything about them.

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.200
Then, can I use ‘a’ or ‘an’?

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:30.000
No, ‘a’ or ‘an’ is used for any one thing.

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.680
So here we do not need any article.

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.040
“They’re oranges.”

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:39.695
“What are they?”

01:55:39.695 --> 01:55:40.480
“They’re oranges.”

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:40.800
Okay.

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.000
“Where __ __ oranges?”

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:46.240
Okay.

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:54.160
Now, again, you know I’m talking about these
specific oranges, so we use ‘the’.

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:57.600
“Where __ the oranges?”

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:04.080
Okay, remember, when you ask a question with
plural, you need ‘are’.

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.520
“Where are the oranges?”

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:09.440
Okay.

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:11.600
Now, let’s think about the preposition.

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:14.480
“They’re ___ the chair.”

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:18.800
Okay.

01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:21.600
The preposition we need is ‘under’.

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:24.080
Okay.

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:28.240
They’re not ‘on’, “they’re ‘under’ the chair.”

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.080
Okay, let’s move on to the last part.

01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.840
Okay, let’s continue with the checkup.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.680
Now, we have two short stories here.

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:40.240
You have to help me find the mistakes.

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:44.560
The first sentence says, “It’s snake.”

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:47.920
Well, we’re missing an article.

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:48.560
Okay.

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.320
And that article is ‘a’.

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.400
“It’s a snake.”

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:53.680
Okay.

01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.800
“It’s blue a snake.”

01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.440
Can you find the mistake?

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:01.760
Okay.

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:08.880
Remember, the adjective ‘blue’ has to
go between the article and the noun.

01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:12.800
So, we have to move the article to the front.

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.760
“It’s a blue snake.”

01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:18.080
That is the correct answer.

01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.480
“It’s a blue snake.”

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.960
Okay, the next one.

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:25.440
“The snake under the box.”

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:27.600
It sounds right.

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.480
“The snake under the box.”,

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:32.720
but we forgot the ‘be’ verb.

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:38.320
“The snake is under the box.”

01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.800
Okay, let’s move on to the next story.

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.840
“It’s a octopus.”

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:50.560
Okay, we have an article, but octopus starts
with the vowel ‘o’.

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.200
So, we have to use ‘an’.

01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.080
“It’s an octopus.”

01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:00.000
“An octopus is big.”

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:01.920
Hmmm…

01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.840
This one’s a little bit hard.

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:08.320
But remember, we’re talking about the same
octopus.

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:11.760
So now, this octopus is specific.

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:17.040
So, we have to change the article ‘an’ to ‘the’.

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.880
“The octopus is big.”

01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:24.080
The octopus from the first sentence.

01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:29.280
Last, “The octopus are under the chair.”

01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:31.760
What’s the mistake?

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:33.840
“The octopus…”

01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:35.920
There’s only one.

01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:40.320
So, we don’t use ‘are’, we have to say
“is”.

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:44.560
“The octopus is under the chair.”

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:46.320
Okay.

01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:51.200
So that was our checkup for articles,&nbsp;
prepositions and adjectives.

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:55.120
I hope you guys understand better and I’ll
see you in the next video.

01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:55.760
Thank you.

01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:01.840
Bye.

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:06.080
Hi, everybody.

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:10.640
In this video, we’re going&nbsp;
to learn ‘have’ and ‘has’.

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.840
Now we use ‘have’ or ‘has’ to show possession.

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.040
To show something belongs to you.

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:20.000
Okay.

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.240
So, let’s take a look at the board.

01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:24.080
Okay.

01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:29.840
When you’re talking about ‘you’, or
me, we say, “I have…”

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.600
Okay.

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.640
If something belongs to a boy or man, we say,
“He has…”

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.680
For a girl or a woman.

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.680
“She has…”

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:45.040
For an animal or thing.

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:46.800
“It has…”

01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:51.120
For you, “You have…”

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:53.520
For us.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.440
Me and some other people.

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:58.160
We say, “We have…”

01:59:58.160 --> 01:59:59.760
Okay, and some other people.

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:01.520
“They have…”

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:03.200
Okay.

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:06.800
This is very easy, you just have to remember it.

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:07.600
Okay.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.320
So, let’s practice with these pictures.

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:13.040
Here we have a rabbit…

02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:15.200
and a carrot.

02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.720
So, which one do we have to use?

02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:22.560
Well, a rabbit is an animal.

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:23.920
So, we have to use ‘it’.

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:27.280
“It has a carrot.”

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:31.360
Again, “It has a carrot.”

02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:36.160
Now, in this picture, we have two ants.

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:37.200
Okay.

02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:41.600
So, for two things we have to use ‘they’.

02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.280
Okay.

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:46.320
So, here are two ants and an apple.

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:50.560
So, we’re going to say, “They have an apple.”

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:54.320
“They have an apple.”

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.520
Okay, let’s move on to some more practice.

02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.560
Let’s do some practice together.

02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:06.880
You have to think about if we should use ‘have’
or ‘has’ in the blanks.

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:07.520
Okay.

02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:09.040
So, let’s look at the first one.

02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:12.240
“The girl ‘blank’ long hair.”

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:13.840
Okay.

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:14.960
Now, ‘the girl’.

02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:18.560
We can we use instead of the girl?

02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:19.920
We can say “she”.

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.200
“She” then what do we say?

02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:24.720
“Has.”

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.440
“She has long hair.”

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:28.720
Or…

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.960
“The girl has long hair.”

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:31.760
It’s the same.

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.280
Okay.

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:34.000
The next one.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:36.000
“The boys…”

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.920
Now, there’s an ‘s’ here.

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:40.320
That means there’s more than one boy.

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:44.800
When we have more than one thing, what do we use?

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:46.080
“They.”

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:47.280
Okay.

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:48.160
“They…”

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:51.520
Do we say ‘have’ or ‘has’?

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:54.320
We have to say “have”.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.840
“They have caps.”

02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:58.480
Or…

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:00.400
“The boys have caps.”

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.120
Okay, the next one’s easier.

02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:03.840
“I…”

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:08.160
When we have ‘I’, we say “have”.

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:11.360
“I have a friend.”

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:15.120
Okay, the next one is also easy.

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:15.360
“He…”

02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.360
“He ‘blank’ an umbrella.”

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.520
What do we have to use?

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:23.360
“Has.”

02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.640
“He has an umbrella.”

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:32.080
Okay, the next one says, “The dog ‘blank’ a bone.”

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:34.160
“The dog…”

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:36.880
What do we use for animals?

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:38.080
“It.”

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:39.440
“It…

02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:43.040
has a bone.”

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:46.640
Or… “The dog has a bone.”

02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:48.320
And last.

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:52.480
“My mother and I ‘blank’ a car.”

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:55.120
Okay, this one’s tricky.

02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:56.800
“My mother and I…”

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.840
We have to say “we”.

02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:05.040
“We…have…a car.”

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:09.680
“My mother and I have a car.”

02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:11.600
Okay.

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:15.200
So, I hope you understand how to use ‘have’
and ‘has’.

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:16.880
And I’ll see you in the next video.

02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:17.200
Bye.

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:27.760
Hi, everybody.

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:32.240
In this video, we’re going to learn negatives
with ‘have’ and ‘has’.

02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:35.280
Now this also pretty easy.

02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:38.720
You just have to remember everything that I wrote.

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:39.440
Okay.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:42.240
So, let’s take a look at the board.

02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:47.760
Okay, first, for ‘I’, we use, “I don’t have…”

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.200
Remember, ‘don’t’ is a contraction for ‘do not’.

02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:55.840
“I don’t have…”

02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:02.960
For ‘he, ‘she’ and ‘it’, we use ‘doesn’t have’.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.680
‘Doesn’t’ is a contraction for ‘does
not’.

02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:15.680
“He doesn’t have…”

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:16.454
“She doesn’t have…”

02:04:16.454 --> 02:04:17.200
“It doesn’t have…”

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.720
Now on the bottom.

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.840
For ‘you’, ‘we’, ‘they’, it’s
the same as ‘I’.

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.480
We use ‘don’t have’.

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:28.880
“You don’t have…”

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:33.280
“We don’t have…”
and “They don’t have…”

02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.400
So, let’s look at these pictures.

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:39.440
Remember, we have a rabbit and a carrot.

02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:42.720
So, we said, “It has a carrot.”

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.960
Okay, but, we’re doing&nbsp;
negatives, so we have to say,

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:54.880
“It doesn’t have a cake.”

02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.080
“It doesn’t have a cake.”

02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:56.400
Okay.

02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:00.160
Now here, we have the ants and an apple.

02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:03.840
So, we said, “They have an apple.”

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:04.880
Okay.

02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:12.160
But for this banana here, we have to say,
“They don’t have a banana.”

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.760
“They don’t have a banana.”

02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:20.000
Okay, let’s move on to some more practice.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.440
Now let’s try this practice with the negatives
‘doesn’t have’ and ‘don’t have’ together.

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:31.280
Now this is a little easy because we know
that the second word is have.

02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:36.560
All you have to think is should&nbsp;
we use ‘doesn’t’ or ‘don’t’.

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:36.960
Okay.

02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.320
So, I’m just going to put ‘have’ her first.

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:41.200
Okay.

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:45.120
“She ‘blank’ have short hair.”

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.880
Should we use ‘don’t’ or ‘doesn’t’?

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:54.320
If you remember, for ‘she’, we use ‘doesn’t’.

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:58.800
“She doesn’t have short hair.”

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:00.320
Okay.

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.960
And again, I’m going to put ‘have’ first.

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:05.280
This is easy.

02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:08.960
‘He’ and ‘she’ we both use ‘doesn’t’.

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:13.840
“He doesn’t have an umbrella.”

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:15.920
Okay.

02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:17.040
How about for ‘I’?

02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:20.640
“I doesn’t have….”

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:22.480
Or
“I don’t have…”?

02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:25.760
The correct answer is ‘don’t’.

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:29.840
“I don’t have a wife.”

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:32.160
“People…”

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:39.840
Remember, if we have more than one person,
animal and thing, we have to think of ‘they’.

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:45.840
For ‘they’, do we use
‘don’t’ or ‘doesn’t’?

02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:47.440
Do you remember?

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:50.880
The correct answer is ‘don’t’.

02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:54.960
“People don’t have manners.”

02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:56.240
Okay.

02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:57.840
Next.

02:06:58.480 --> 02:06:58.720
“We…”

02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:03.040
“We ‘blank’ have money.”

02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:06.160
Should we put ‘doesn’t’ or ‘don’t’?

02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:10.560
The correct answer is ‘don’t’.

02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.760
“We don’t have money.”

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.400
Okay, and the last one.

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:17.120
“A snake…”

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.480
A snake is an animal.

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:25.840
What do we use for an animal?

02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:26.160
“It.”

02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:27.840
“It…”

02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:30.080
What should we put here?

02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:35.120
“It…doesn’t…have legs.”

02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:41.680
Okay, so that was our practice the negatives
‘don’t have’ and ‘doesn’t have’.

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:44.960
I hope you understand, and I’ll see you
in the next video.

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:53.840
Bye.

02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:55.520
Hi, everybody.

02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:00.960
In this video, we’re going to learn how
to ask questions using ‘have’.

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:03.120
Okay, let’s look at the board.

02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:08.480
When we are talking about ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘it’,

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.600
the question always begins with ‘does’.

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:15.200
After the pronoun, we have ‘have’.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:18.080
So, we say, “Does he have…”

02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:20.080
“Does she have…”

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:21.840
“Does it have…”

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:27.680
Now, let’s practice with this question and
let’s look at the two answers.

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.200
Okay.

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:30.400
“Does he have a friend?”

02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:34.560
If the answer is ‘yes’, we say “yes”,

02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:39.360
in the blank, we match… this has to be the same.

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:41.760
“Yes, he does.”

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:43.840
If the answer is ‘no’.

02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:46.320
“No, he doesn’t.”

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:48.640
“Does he have a friend?”

02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:51.200
“Yes, she does.”

02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:54.000
“No, she doesn’t.”

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:57.120
“Does it have a friend?”

02:08:58.240 --> 02:08:59.920
“Yes, it does.”

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.560
“No, it doesn’t.”

02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:06.000
Okay, so remember ‘does…have’.

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:13.280
Now, when we use ‘you’, ‘we’, ‘they’,
we use ‘do’ in the front.

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:15.600
And ‘have’ after.

02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:17.840
“Do you have a friend?”

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:20.640
“Do we have a friend?”

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.960
“Do they have a friend?”

02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:24.960
Okay.

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.600
And again, we have two answers.

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:29.680
We finish with ‘do’ or ‘don’t’.

02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:32.320
So, “Do you have a friend?”

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.280
“Yes, I do.”

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:38.960
Right, the question is asking ‘you’,
so, you say “I do.”

02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:41.360
Or, “No, I don’t.”

02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:44.000
“Do we have a friend?”

02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:46.320
“Yes, we do.”

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.440
Or, “No, we don’t.”

02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:51.440
And last.

02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:52.960
“Do they have a friend?”

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.200
“Yes, they do.”

02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:57.680
“No, they don’t.”

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:00.920
Okay, let’s move on to some more practice.

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:03.760
Alright, let’s try this practice together.

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:06.800
I know it looks hard, but I’m going to help you.

02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:08.000
Okay.

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:10.800
So let’s look at the first practice.

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:12.880
It’s a question.

02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.040
Okay, so remember when we ask a question,
we begin with ‘do’ or ‘does’.

02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:20.320
Okay.

02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:21.280
We have ‘she’.

02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:25.520
Well, remember for all questions we use ‘have’.

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:29.760
In the front, should we use ‘does’ or ‘do’?

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:33.040
The answer is ‘does’.

02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:35.680
“Does she have a dress?”

02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:39.040
When we answer, “Yes…”

02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:41.840
What do we put here?

02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:44.560
Remember, we put the pronoun ‘she’.

02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:47.920
And the answer ‘does’.

02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.800
“Yes, she does.”

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.040
The next one.

02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:54.080
We have ‘they’.

02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:57.200
Okay, ‘have’ is again the same.

02:10:58.080 --> 02:10:59.200
“…have a bicycle?”

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:01.840
Okay, what goes in the front?

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:05.120
For ‘they’, we use ‘do’.

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:08.320
“Do they have a bicycle?”

02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:12.000
This time the answer is negative.

02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:14.000
“No, they….”

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:16.480
What do we put here?

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:20.000
It doesn’t make sense to say, “do”.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:20.400
Right?

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:21.440
“No, they do.”

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:22.560
That’s wrong.

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:23.920
It’s a negative.

02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:27.200
We have to say, “No, they don’t.”

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:29.040
“No, they do not.”

02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:33.440
Okay, and again, we have ‘have’ over here.

02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:34.800
“It…”

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.320
Which one, ‘do’ or ‘does’?

02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:40.960
The answer is ‘does’.

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.520
“Does it have a ball?”

02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:47.520
Again, the answer is negative.

02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:50.240
“No, it…does not.”

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:54.960
or the contraction, “No, it doesn’t.”

02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:56.880
Okay.

02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:00.640
So that was our practice for asking questions
with ‘have’.

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:05.840
I hope you understand and I’ll&nbsp;
see you in the next video.&nbsp;

02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:18.640
This is a checkup video for 'have', 'has',
'don't have', 'doesn't have'

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.640
and questions with 'have'.

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:22.080
Let's take a look at the board.

02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:26.960
Here, we have a picture of a dog and a ball.

02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:31.600
And this ball belongs to this dog.

02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:34.240
So let's make a sentence about this picture.

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:35.840
Ok...

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:38.080
The dog is an animal.

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:39.840
So, we have to use 'it'.

02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:41.600
Ok...

02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:44.960
With 'it', do we use 'have' or 'has'?

02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:48.960
We have to use 'has'.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.680
"It has a ball."

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:56.560
Now, there's a hat, but it says "no".

02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:57.520
It's negative.

02:12:58.480 --> 02:12:59.280
So, "It..."

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.560
Remember, for negative, we always use 'have'.

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:06.640
But what goes in the front?

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:09.360
'Doesn't' or 'don't'?

02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:14.240
For 'it', we say "doesn't".

02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:17.920
"It doesn't have a hat."

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.280
Next, we have a question.

02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:23.360
We use 'have'.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.280
Remember, we have to put the pronoun over here.

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.240
The same one.

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:32.480
And we put 'does' or 'do' in the front.

02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.400
What do you think?

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:38.720
We have to say, "does".

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.040
"Does it have a ball?"

02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:43.840
Well, "Does it have a ball?"

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.160
"Yes, it does."

02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.040
Let's move on to the next part.

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.080
Here we have two people.

02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:53.520
So, we're going to say "they".

02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:57.840
And a car...that belongs to them.

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:01.840
For 'they', we have to say "have".

02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.480
"They have a car."

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:08.560
Here, there's a bus.

02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:10.080
But, again, it says, "no".

02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:12.320
Negative.

02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:14.800
"They 'blank' 'blank' a bus."

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:17.760
Again, for negative, we say "have".

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.520
'Doesn't have' or 'don't have'?

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.320
Which one is it?

02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.120
For 'don't'...uhh for 'they', we say,

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:28.880
"They don't have a bus."

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:31.360
Ok, and we have a question.

02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:35.200
Well, again, we have to put the same pronoun.

02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:38.480
How about in the front?

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:40.320
'Do' or 'does'?

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.600
For 'they', we put 'do'.

02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.000
"Do they have a bus?"

02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:48.080
"Do they have a bus?"

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:50.800
"No, they don't."

02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:54.040
Ok, let's move on to some more practice.

02:14:54.040 --> 02:15:00.400
Ok, now for this practice, we have to find
the mistakes in these sentences.

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:02.000
What's wrong with them?

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:02.480
Ok...

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:05.200
So, let's look at the first one.

02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.840
"They has two watches."

02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:09.680
Hmmmm.

02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:15.520
Remember, for 'they', we have&nbsp;
to use 'have', not 'has'.

02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:18.800
"They have two watches."

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.840
The next one is a question.

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:24.960
"Does they have three watches?"

02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:26.720
Ok...

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:33.280
Remember, when we start a question, we have
to use 'do' or 'does'.

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:36.240
Here we have 'does'.

02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:40.000
But remember, for 'they', we begin with 'do'.

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:43.280
"Do they have three watches?"

02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:46.000
And in the answer...

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.200
"No, we don't."

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.840
What's wrong with this answer?

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.160
Remember, the pronoun has to match.

02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:55.440
It has to be the same.

02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:58.080
"Do they have three watches?"

02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:00.480
"No, they don't."

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.040
Let's look at these.

02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:05.120
"She have a dress."

02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:10.320
Remember, for 'she', we use 'has'.

02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.480
"She has a dress."

02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:15.040
How about in the question?

02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:17.840
"Do she have a hat?"

02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:25.200
Remember, we begin with 'do' or 'does', but
for 'she', we should begin with 'does'.

02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:27.120
"Does she have a hat?"

02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:29.040
And the answer.

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:30.240
"No, she do."

02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:32.960
Hmmm.

02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.960
'No' means it's negative.

02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:37.040
So, we need a negative here.

02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:38.960
Is it 'don't' or 'doesn't'?

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:40.960
"No, she..

02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:46.080
doesn't." is the correct answer.

02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:46.800
Okay.

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:48.160
So that was our checkup.

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.840
I hope you understand better.

02:16:49.840 --> 02:17:00.080
And I'll see you in the next video.

02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:01.040
Hi, everybody.

02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.800
I’m Esther.
Welcome to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:08.160
my English grammar course on the tenses.
I’m going to teach you how to use the twelve&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:14.160
tenses in the past, present, and future.
It’s a great course, and there’s a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:16.479
important information.
So keep watching.

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:20.880
Hi, everybody.

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:22.160
My name is Esther.

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:26.800
I'm so excited to teach you the present simple
tense in today's video.

02:17:27.359 --> 02:17:30.240
Now this lesson can be a little difficult,

02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:33.359
so I'll do my best to keep it easy and fun
for you.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.600
My goal is for you to understand how and when
to use this grammar by the end of the video.

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:41.840
Let's get started.

02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:48.000
Let's start with the first usage for the present
simple tense.

02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:50.960
The first usage is pretty easy.

02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:55.600
We use it to talk about facts, truths, and
generalizations.

02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:56.880
Let's look at some examples.

02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:00.000
‘The Sun is bright.’

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.439
Now that's a fact.

02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:02.879
It doesn't change.

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:05.280
Everybody knows that the Sun is bright.

02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:06.719
It was bright yesterday.

02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:07.600
It's bright today.

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:09.281
And it will be bright tomorrow.

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.559
That makes it a fact.

02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.960
‘Pigs don't fly.’

02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:14.960
That's also a fact.

02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:17.840
Everybody knows that pigs don't fly.

02:18:19.439 --> 02:18:21.679
‘Cats are better than dogs.’

02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:23.600
Now this you may not agree with.

02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:25.360
This is my truth.

02:18:25.359 --> 02:18:29.599
I'm making a generalization about cats and
dogs in this example.

02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:32.800
And finally, ‘It's cold in winter.’

02:18:33.439 --> 02:18:38.319
This really depends on where you live,
but for a lot of people, or let's say for

02:18:38.319 --> 02:18:40.479
most people,
it is cold in the winter,

02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:43.280
so that's the truth for some people.

02:18:44.399 --> 02:18:49.359
Now let's look back and see what verb I used
in the present simple tense.

02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:52.479
For the first sentence, we have ‘is’.

02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:56.720
I use the ‘be’ verb ‘is’ to talk about
the Sun.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.680
In the next sentence,
I use the negative of do - ‘do not’

02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:09.600
And you'll notice I use the contraction and
put these two words together to make it ‘don't’.

02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:13.440
‘Cats are better than dogs.’

02:19:13.439 --> 02:19:18.719
I use the ‘be’ verb "are" to talk about
cats because ‘cats’ is plural.

02:19:19.359 --> 02:19:22.080
And finally, it's cold and winter.

02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:25.920
Here I use the ‘be’ verb "is" again,

02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:29.680
but I use the contraction to combine ‘it’
and ‘is’

02:19:30.319 --> 02:19:31.280
and made ‘it’s’.

02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:33.840
Let's move on to the next usage.

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:40.400
We also use the present simple tense to talk
about habits and routines.

02:19:40.399 --> 02:19:43.519
So things and actions that happen regularly.

02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:44.800
Let’s look at the examples.

02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:48.241
‘I always eat lunch at noon.’

02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:53.359
You'll notice I use the adverb ‘always’
because I'm talking about something that I

02:19:53.359 --> 02:19:54.719
do regularly.

02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:55.360
What is that?

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:57.440
‘Eat lunch at noon.’

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.240
So I use the present simple tense.

02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:02.080
And here I use the verb ‘eat’.

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:03.680
‘I eat…’

02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:07.920
The second example says you play games every
day.

02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:12.800
Do you see the clue that helps you know that
this is something that happens regularly?

02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:14.960
It's ‘every day’.

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:18.640
So it's something that happens as a routine
or a habit,

02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:20.640
so you play games.

02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:22.161
The verb here is ‘play’.

02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:23.920
‘You play…’

02:20:25.359 --> 02:20:30.240
The next example says ‘Seth starts work
at 9:00 a.m. daily.’

02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:33.599
Again this is something that happens regularly.

02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:36.480
‘Seth goes to work at 9:00 a.m.’ every
day.

02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:41.439
Now you'll notice I put a blue line under
the ‘s’ in ‘starts’.

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:44.319
Can you figure out why?

02:20:44.319 --> 02:20:49.840
Well remember that when the subject of a sentence
is ‘he’, ‘she’, or ‘it’,

02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:55.600
we need to add an ‘s’ or ‘es’ to the
end of the verb in the present simple tense.

02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:59.519
Seth is a ‘he’, so we need to add an ‘s’.

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:03.840
‘Seth starts work at 9:00 a.m. daily.’

02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:09.040
And the last example:
‘They study English every Monday.’

02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:13.200
Again, ‘every Monday’ means that they
do it regularly,

02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:16.160
and that's why we use the present simple tense.

02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:17.280
‘They study…’.

02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:21.920
So as a review,
remember we use the present simple tense

02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:26.319
to talk about habits and routines that happen
regularly.

02:21:26.319 --> 02:21:27.120
Let's move on.

02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:32.320
We also use the present simple tense with
non-continuous verbs.

02:21:32.319 --> 02:21:35.200
These are verbs that we&nbsp;
don't use in the continuous&nbsp;

02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:35.920
form,

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.520
even if they're happening right now.

02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:40.080
They're also called stative verbs.

02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:46.480
These are connected with thoughts, opinions,
feelings, emotions, and our five senses.

02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:48.240
Let's look at these examples.

02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:50.240
‘I love my mom.’

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:52.800
The verb here is ‘love’.

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:56.400
That's an emotion, so I use the present simple
tense.

02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:58.639
‘It smells good.’

02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:03.920
‘Smell’ is one of the five senses, so
I use the present simple tense.

02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:09.120
You'll notice I underlined the ‘s’ because
remember the subject is ‘it’.

02:22:10.319 --> 02:22:12.000
‘Kelly feels happy.’

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:14.880
This is talking about a feeling.

02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:19.600
Again the subject here is ‘Kelly’ which
is a ‘she’,

02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:21.840
so I added an ‘s’ to the verb.

02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:25.520
And finally, ‘They need help.’

02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:30.719
We don't say, ‘they are needing help’
even though it's happening right now.

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:34.400
‘Need’ is non-continuous, so we say,
‘they need help’,

02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:40.399
so remember you also use the present simple
tense with non-continuous verbs,

02:22:40.399 --> 02:22:45.759
connected with thoughts, opinions, feelings,
emotions, and our five senses.

02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:46.800
Let's move on.

02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:51.920
Speakers occasionally use the present simple
tense to talk about something that will happen

02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:53.120
in the near future.

02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:58.400
Now this can be a little confusing, but we're
not using the future tense,

02:22:58.399 --> 02:23:00.719
we're using the present simple tense.

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:04.960
It's possible to do that and it's actually
common for people to do that.

02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:08.720
Again, for something that will happen in the
near future.

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:09.920
Let's look at the examples.

02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:12.880
‘I have class at 6 p.m.’

02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:17.040
‘6 p.m.’ that's pretty soon, so I can
say,

02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:18.319
'I have class.'

02:23:18.319 --> 02:23:20.240
- the present simple tense.

02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:23.920
‘Lisa arrives on Sunday.’

02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:26.960
Again the near future, ‘Sunday’.

02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:29.120
So I use the present simple tense.

02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:36.000
I added an ‘s’ at the end of arrive, because
Lisa, the subject, is a ‘she’.

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:38.960
‘We start work soon.’

02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:42.480
Again, the near future, ‘soon’,

02:23:42.479 --> 02:23:45.839
so I use the present simple verb ‘start’.

02:23:46.399 --> 02:23:49.439
And finally, ‘My students come tomorrow.’

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.120
This is something that will happen in the
near future,

02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:55.120
so I use the verb ‘come’.

02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:02.000
So remember it is possible, and it is common
to use the present simple tense

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.040
to talk about something that will happen in
the near future.

02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:07.680
Let's go to the next usage.

02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:12.241
Let's talk about a possible negative usage
for the present simple tense,

02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:14.800
and that is ‘do not’ and ‘does not’.

02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:18.560
The first example says,
‘Mike eats bread.’

02:24:19.359 --> 02:24:24.880
I put an ‘s’ at the end of ‘eat’ because
the subject is Mike which is a ‘he’.

02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:28.080
Now that's not a negative statement.

02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:31.519
What happens when I want to turn it into a
negative statement?

02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:35.440
Well I change it like this -
‘Mike doesn't eat bread.’

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.920
So you'll notice that I didn't move the ‘s’
here, okay.

02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:42.000
Instead I added ‘doesn't’.

02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:48.880
I took ‘does’ and ‘not’ and I turned
it into a contraction by combining the two

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.720
and making it ‘doesn't’.

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:54.320
So if the subject is ‘he’, ‘she’,
or ‘it’,

02:24:54.319 --> 02:24:57.840
we use ‘does not’ or ‘doesn't’ to
make it negative.

02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:00.240
‘You swim well.’

02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:05.520
In this case, I don't need to put an ‘s’
at the end of ‘swim’ because the subject

02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:06.000
is ‘you’.

02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.120
If I want to make this sentence negative,
I use ‘don't’.

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:13.600
‘You don't swim well.’

02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:17.679
I use the contraction for ‘do’ and ‘not’.

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:20.000
I combine them to make ‘don't’,

02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:24.640
so if the subject is ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’,
or ‘they’,

02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:27.360
we use ‘do not’ or ‘don't’.

02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:33.920
So to review ‘do not’ and ‘does not’
or ‘don't’ and ‘doesn't’

02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:37.600
is a possible usage for the negative for present
simple

02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:37.840
tense.

02:25:38.399 --> 02:25:39.359
Let's continue on.

02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:45.120
Now I'll talk about one possible question
form for the present simple tense

02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:48.399
and that is by using ‘do’ or ‘does’.

02:25:48.399 --> 02:25:51.920
So let's look at the example,
‘They live here.’

02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:53.520
That's not a question, right?

02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:55.040
'They live here’

02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:59.281
In order to turn it into a question, it's
really simple.

02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:04.479
All I have to do is add ‘do’ to the beginning
and add a question mark at the end.

02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:06.479
‘Do they live here?’

02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:11.040
So if the subject is ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’,
or ‘they’,

02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:14.880
simply add ‘do’ to the beginning of the
question.

02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:18.960
How about this one,
‘He plays soccer.’

02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:24.560
In this statement, the subject is ‘he’
and that's why you should know by now,

02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:27.040
I have an ‘s’ at the end of ‘play’.

02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:32.640
However, to turn this into a question, I add
‘does’ at the beginning.

02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:35.519
‘Does he play soccer?’

02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:41.840
What you'll notice here is that I no longer
have the ‘s’ at the end of play.

02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:45.040
Instead I just used ‘does’ at the beginning,

02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:49.760
so for ‘he’, ‘she’, or ‘it’, put
‘does’ at the beginning,

02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:54.320
and don't worry about putting an ‘s’ or
‘es’ at the end of the verb.

02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:01.120
So to review, one possible way of forming
a question for the present simple tense is

02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:03.599
using ‘do’ or ‘does’ at the beginning.

02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:05.359
Alright let's move on.

02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:08.240
Let's start with the first checkup.

02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:11.519
In this checkup, I want you to focus on the
‘be’ verbs.

02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:18.399
Remember ‘be’ verbs, in the present simple
tense, can be ‘is’, ‘am’, or ‘are’.

02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:21.519
Take a look at the first sentence.

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:24.560
It says, ‘She _ blank _ at school.’

02:27:25.439 --> 02:27:28.080
The subject of this sentence is ‘she’.

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:31.120
What ‘be’ verb do we use for ‘she’?

02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:34.400
The correct answer is ‘is’.

02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:39.120
Now if you were thinking of the negative,
the

02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:41.760
correct answer would be ‘she isn't’

02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:44.320
or ‘she is not’.

02:27:44.319 --> 02:27:45.599
That's correct as well.

02:27:46.479 --> 02:27:52.399
And if we want to use a contraction for ‘she
is’, we can say ‘she's at school’

02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:58.160
For the next one, it says,
‘They _ blank _ twenty years old.’

02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:01.439
The subject of this sentence is ‘they’.

02:28:02.399 --> 02:28:04.559
What ‘be’ verb do we use for ‘they’?

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:12.080
The correct answer is ‘are’.

02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:16.640
For the negative, you can also use ‘aren't’
or ‘are not’.

02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:22.720
Also if you want to use the contraction for
‘they are’, you can say,

02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:25.840
‘They're 20 years old.’

02:28:26.399 --> 02:28:30.240
The next sentence says,
‘His father _ blank_ busy.’

02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:34.479
The subject of this sentence is ‘his father’.

02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:38.479
What subject pronoun do we use for ‘his
father’?

02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:40.800
The correct answer is ‘he’.

02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:46.960
Remember for ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’,
the ‘be’ verb is ‘is’.

02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:52.720
For the negative, we can say ‘isn't’ or
‘is not’.

02:28:53.439 --> 02:28:59.120
And for a contraction, for ‘father’ and
‘is’, we can say, ‘His father's busy.’

02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:07.840
Now I want you to try to find the mistakes
in this sentence.

02:29:08.399 --> 02:29:10.399
‘We isn't good friends.’

02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:12.399
Did you find the mistake?

02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:17.440
This is the mistake.

02:29:17.439 --> 02:29:22.160
The subject is ‘we’ and the ‘be’ verb
is ‘are’.

02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:25.760
Therefore, the correct answer is ‘we are
not’,

02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:29.200
or the contraction, ‘we aren't good friends.’

02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:35.120
The next sentence.

02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:36.399
Can you find the mistake?

02:29:37.439 --> 02:29:39.040
‘Are John a teacher?’

02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:42.559
Think about the subject of this sentence.

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:45.599
The subject is ‘John’.

02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:49.840
And ‘John’, the subject pronoun is ‘he’.

02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:54.480
Therefore, we don't use ‘are’, we use
‘is’.

02:29:56.640 --> 02:30:00.480
‘Is John a teacher?’

02:30:00.479 --> 02:30:01.599
‘Is John a teacher?’

02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:04.640
And finally, ‘It am a puppy.’

02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:07.840
hmm
This one is a big mistake.

02:30:08.479 --> 02:30:10.160
The subject here is ‘it’.

02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:13.120
What ‘be’ verb do we use for ‘it’?

02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:15.840
The correct answer is ‘is’.

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:21.760
So we don't say, ‘It am a puppy,’ we say,
‘It is a puppy.’

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:23.760
Great job guys.

02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:25.840
Let's move on to the next checkup.

02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:30.640
For the next checkup, I want you to think
of some other verbs in the present simple

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:30.960
tense.

02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:33.760
Take a look at the first sentence.

02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:38.240
‘He __ blank __ …’, I want you to think
of the verb, ‘like his dinner’.

02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:43.439
What do we do to the verb when the subject
is ‘he’, ‘she’, or ‘it’?

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:45.840
Remember we add an ‘s’.

02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:50.241
‘He likes his dinner.’

02:30:50.960 --> 02:30:55.120
For the negative, you can also say, ‘He
doesn't like his dinner.’

02:30:56.240 --> 02:31:01.120
The next sentence says, ‘My students __
blank __…’, I want you to think of ‘need’,

02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:02.160
‘…books’.

02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:06.880
What is the subject pronoun for ‘my students’?

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:09.281
The correct answer is ‘they’.

02:31:10.319 --> 02:31:15.840
If the subject is ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’,
or ‘they’, in the present simple tense,

02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:19.120
we don't change the verb,
we keep it as is.

02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:24.640
So the correct answer is,
‘My students need books.’

02:31:25.359 --> 02:31:30.160
Now for the negative, you can say,
‘My students don't need books.’

02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:35.600
The next sentence says,
‘I __ blank __…’, think of the verb,

02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:37.440
‘…live in London.’

02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:39.920
What do we do here?

02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:46.080
Again the subject is ‘I’, therefore we
don't change the verb.

02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:49.840
The correct answer is,
‘I live in London.’

02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:51.600
What's the negative?

02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:54.319
‘I don't live in London.’

02:31:55.520 --> 02:32:00.480
For the next part, I would like for you to
try to find the mistake in the sentence.

02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:03.200
‘He doesn't likes math.’

02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:05.359
What's the error here?

02:32:06.319 --> 02:32:07.920
Well this is a negative.

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:11.201
‘He doesn't…’, that's correct.

02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:17.439
However, we do not add an ‘s’ when we
have ‘doesn't’ in front of ‘it’.

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:20.800
‘Do he eat candy?’

02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:24.080
Here we have a question.

02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:26.800
The subject of the sentence is ‘he’.

02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:33.281
For ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’, when we're
making a sentence in the present simple tense,

02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:36.800
we use ‘does’ not ‘do’.

02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:40.640
So the correct answer is,
‘Does he eat candy?’

02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:45.840
And finally, ‘Sam is play computer games.’

02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:50.960
There are two present simple verbs here and
we can't have that,

02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:56.880
so the correct way to fix this sentence is
to get rid of the ‘is’.

02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:04.319
So take that out and say,
‘Sam plays computer games.’

02:33:04.319 --> 02:33:08.639
Add an ‘s’ because the subject is ‘Sam’
which is a ‘he’.

02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:10.480
Great job!

02:33:10.479 --> 02:33:12.639
Let's move on to the next practice.

02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:16.241
For this next practice, we're taking a look
at routines.

02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:22.160
Remember the present simple tense can be used
to describe events that happen regularly.

02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:24.240
Let's take a look at the first sentence,

02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:28.080
‘We _ blank _ the bus every day.’

02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:30.240
And I want you to use the verb ‘take’.

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:35.840
Here we see the clue word ‘every day’
which shows that this is a routine.

02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:39.120
The subject of the sentence is ‘we’.

02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:41.920
In the present simple tense,

02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:47.040
remember if the subject is ‘I’, ‘you’,
‘we’, or ‘they’,

02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:48.880
we do not change the verb.

02:33:49.439 --> 02:33:55.439
Therefore the correct answer is,
‘We take the bus every day.’

02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:02.241
In the second sentence it says,
‘He _ blank _ to school every morning.’

02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:03.760
Again a routine.

02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:06.639
The subject here is ‘he’.

02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:11.041
What do we do if the subject is ‘he’,
‘she’, or ‘it’?

02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:14.720
We add ‘s’ or ‘es’ to the verb.

02:34:15.439 --> 02:34:20.639
In this example, the verb is ‘go’, so
we have to add ‘es’.

02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:25.120
‘He goes to school every morning.’

02:34:26.319 --> 02:34:31.920
In the next sentence, it says,
‘Lizzy not play (in parenthesis) tennis.’

02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:35.440
Here I want you to think about the negative
form.

02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:38.400
Lizzy is a ‘she’.

02:34:38.399 --> 02:34:43.040
The subject pronoun is ‘she’ so what do
we do for the negative?

02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:51.920
We say ‘does not’ or the contraction ‘doesn't
play tennis’.

02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:56.080
We do not add an ‘s’ or ‘es’ to the
end of the verb.

02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:59.840
Instead we say ‘doesn't’ or ‘does not’.

02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:04.560
Now I want you to find a mistake in the next
sentence.

02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.000
‘They watches TV at night.’

02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:11.840
Can you figure out what's wrong with the sentence?

02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:14.161
The subject is ‘they’.

02:35:15.359 --> 02:35:19.280
Therefore, remember, we do not change the
verb.

02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:22.161
We say ‘watch’.

02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:25.840
‘They watch TV at night’.

02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:32.400
In the next sentence, or question, it says,
‘Does he plays soccer every week?’

02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:35.600
The subject of the sentence is ‘he’.

02:35:36.399 --> 02:35:40.559
To make a sentence, putting ‘does’ at
the beginning is okay,

02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:45.840
However, we don't put an ‘s’ at the end
of ‘play’.

02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:49.680
Therefore, the correct answer is to simply
say,

02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:53.840
‘Does he play soccer every week?’

02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:58.800
And finally, ‘He always forget his book.’

02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:02.319
In this case, the subject is ‘he’.

02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:10.559
Remember, again, for he/she/it we add 's'
or 'es' to the end of the verb.

02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:12.400
What's the verb in the sentence?

02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:14.000
It's ‘forget’.

02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:21.840
Therefore we have to say,
‘He always forgets his book.’

02:36:22.399 --> 02:36:23.280
Great job.

02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:25.599
Let's move on to the next practice.

02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:31.281
In this checkup, we'll take a look at how
the present simple tense can be used to describe

02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:32.240
future events.

02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:35.599
Take a look at the first sentence.

02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:38.720
It says, ‘The airplane _ blank _ tonight.’

02:36:39.439 --> 02:36:41.599
And we're looking at the verb ‘leave’.

02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:44.960
What is the subject of the sentence?

02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:47.840
The correct answer is ‘airplane’.

02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:51.680
What subject pronoun do we use for ‘airplane’?

02:36:52.479 --> 02:36:53.120
It's ‘it’.

02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:59.840
Remember in the present simple tense, for
‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’, we add an ‘s’

02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:01.600
or ‘es’ to the verb.

02:37:02.319 --> 02:37:06.000
The verb here is ‘leave’ so we simply
add an ‘s’.

02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:11.360
The correct answer is,
‘The airplane leaves tonight.’

02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:18.161
In the second sentence, it says,
‘Does the movie _blank_ soon?’

02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:20.240
And we're using the verb ‘start’.

02:37:21.359 --> 02:37:23.679
What is the subject of this sentence?

02:37:24.399 --> 02:37:25.519
It’s ‘movie’.

02:37:26.319 --> 02:37:29.359
And what subject pronoun do we use for movie?

02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:30.640
It’s ‘it’.

02:37:31.359 --> 02:37:35.200
So it's like saying, ‘Does it _ blank _
soon?’

02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:42.240
Well this is a question, so we already have
the correct word in the front - ‘does’.

02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:47.760
For he/she/it, when we're asking a question,
we use ‘does’.

02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:54.241
Now all we have to do is use the same verb
in its base form,

02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:57.760
so ‘Does the movie start soon?’

02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:01.281
We do not add an ‘s’ or ‘es’ here.

02:38:02.399 --> 02:38:06.000
Finally, it says,
‘Viki _ blank _ tomorrow.’

02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:09.520
The subject of the sentence is ‘Vicki’.

02:38:10.399 --> 02:38:14.160
‘Vicki’ is a girl so the subject pronoun
is ‘she’.

02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:19.439
You'll remember now that for… in this case,
we put ‘works’.

02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:23.200
w-o-r-k-s ‘works’.

02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:25.680
‘Vicki works tomorrow.’

02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:29.760
Now let's find the mistakes in the sentence
below.

02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:33.600
‘He do leave at 3:30 p.m.’

02:38:34.319 --> 02:38:36.160
Actually there's only one mistake.

02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:37.520
Can you find it?

02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:42.000
‘He do leave at 3:30 p.m.’

02:38:43.359 --> 02:38:46.639
We do not need the ‘do’ here.

02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:50.880
We only use ‘do’ in a question or in the
negative form.

02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:55.041
But also the subject is ‘he’, so we would
use ‘does’.

02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:58.000
Either way we don't need this here.

02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:02.640
Well now we have the verb ‘leave’ with
the subject ‘he’.

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:04.560
Do you know what to do?

02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:10.080
We simply change this to ‘leaves’.

02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:12.319
Just like we did in the first sentence.

02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:15.680
‘He leaves at 3:30 p.m.’

02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:21.040
In the next sentence,
‘They don't start school today.’

02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:24.080
We have a negative sentence.

02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:26.640
‘They don't…’, that's correct.

02:39:27.359 --> 02:39:29.200
‘…do not’ is correct.

02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:30.639
For subject pronoun ‘they’.

02:39:31.439 --> 02:39:36.559
However, in the negative form, we don't have
to change the main verb at all.

02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:43.520
Therefore, all we will do is say,
‘They don't start school today.’

02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:44.320
No ‘s’.

02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:48.800
Finally, ‘Does we eat at noon?’

02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:50.480
Take a look.

02:39:50.479 --> 02:39:54.639
What is the subject or subject pronoun in
the sentence?

02:39:55.359 --> 02:39:56.960
The correct answer is ‘we’.

02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:00.480
Think about the question form.

02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:06.319
Do we say ‘do’ or ‘does’ in the question
form for the subject pronoun ‘we’?

02:40:07.439 --> 02:40:09.839
The correct answer is ‘do’.

02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:11.120
We say ‘do’.

02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:16.160
So the correct way to say this sentence or
question is,

02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:18.000
‘Do we eat at noon?’

02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:20.240
Great job guys.

02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:21.840
You're done with the practice.

02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:23.440
Thank you for your hard work.

02:40:23.439 --> 02:40:24.240
Let's move on.

02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:26.319
Good job guys.

02:40:26.319 --> 02:40:28.719
You put in a lot of practice today.

02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:33.760
The present simple tense is not easy,
and I'm really happy to see how hard you guys

02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:34.960
worked on mastering it.

02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:39.520
Be sure to check out my other videos and thank
you for watching this video.

02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:40.720
I'll see you next time.

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:47.840
Bye.

02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:51.520
Hi, everybody.
I'm Esther.

02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:56.480
I'm so excited to be teaching you the&nbsp;
present continuous tense in this video.

02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:01.040
This tense is used to describe:
an action that's happening right now,

02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:06.320
a longer action in progress ,
and something happening in the near future.

02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:10.240
There's a lot to learn, but don't worry I'll
guide you through it.

02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:11.200
Let's get started.

02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:20.400
The present continuous tense is used to talk&nbsp;
about actions that are happening right now.

02:41:20.399 --> 02:41:21.279
For example,

02:41:21.279 --> 02:41:25.279
‘I'm teaching English’ and
‘You are studying English.’

02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:28.000
Let's take a look at some more examples.

02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:32.400
The first sentence says, ‘He is watching a movie’.

02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:36.240
We start with the subject and a ‘be’ verb.

02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:38.960
In this case, the subject is ‘he’.

02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:43.840
For ‘he’ / ‘she’ and ‘it’,&nbsp;
we use the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:49.520
Then you'll notice I added an ‘-ing’&nbsp;
to the end of the verb ‘watch’.

02:41:50.319 --> 02:41:52.240
‘He is watching a movie.’

02:41:53.279 --> 02:41:57.359
The next sentence says,
‘Tim is playing a computer game.’

02:41:57.359 --> 02:41:59.040
He's doing that right now.

02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:05.680
Tim is a ‘he’, therefore, again&nbsp;
we use the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

02:42:06.319 --> 02:42:12.319
And again you'll notice I added&nbsp;
‘-ing’ to the end of the verb.

02:42:12.319 --> 02:42:13.840
The next sentence says,

02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:16.319
‘The machine is making a noise.’

02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:20.240
Now pay attention to the subject, ‘the machine’.

02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:22.880
What is the proper pronoun?

02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:28.241
The answer is ‘it’, therefore&nbsp;
we use the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:31.359
‘The machine is making a noise.’

02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:38.559
We can also say, ‘It is making a noise’.
Or the contraction, ‘It's making a noise’.

02:42:39.359 --> 02:42:43.040
And finally, ‘Tom and Ben are speaking English’.

02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:47.040
In this case, you'll notice&nbsp;
that we use the ‘be’ verb ‘are’.

02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:49.120
Can you figure out why?

02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:55.599
That's because Tom and Ben -
the subject pronoun for these two is ‘they’.

02:42:56.479 --> 02:42:58.319
‘They are speaking English.’

02:42:59.439 --> 02:43:01.439
Let's move on to the next usage.

02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:08.480
The present continuous tense is also used
to describe a longer action in progress.

02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:12.399
Even though you might not be&nbsp;
doing the action right now.

02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:14.880
Let's take a look at some examples.

02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:16.960
The first sentence says,

02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:19.760
‘I'm reading an interesting book these days.’

02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:24.880
In this case, the subject is&nbsp;
‘I’, so the ‘be’ verb is ‘am’.

02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:31.120
In this example, we use the contraction&nbsp;
‘I'm’ by putting ‘I’ and ‘am’ together.

02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:36.320
Again, you'll notice there's&nbsp;
an ‘-ing’ after the verb.

02:43:36.319 --> 02:43:38.000
The next sentence says,

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.960
‘You are studying to become an English teacher.’

02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:43.280
The subject here is ‘you’,

02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:46.399
therefore the ‘be’ verb is ‘are’.

02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:51.680
Next, ‘Steven is preparing for the IELTS exam.’

02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:56.080
The subject here is ‘Steven’ which is a ‘he’,

02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:59.200
therefore we use the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

02:44:00.399 --> 02:44:04.639
And finally,
‘John and June are working at a company.’

02:44:05.359 --> 02:44:10.479
If you look at the subject ‘John and June’,
the pronoun for that is ‘they’.

02:44:11.279 --> 02:44:13.359
That's why we use the ‘be’ verb ‘are’.

02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:16.240
‘They are working at a company.’

02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:18.960
Let's move on to the next usage.

02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:24.560
The present continuous is also used&nbsp;
to talk about near future plans.

02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:25.440
Let's take a look.

02:44:26.399 --> 02:44:28.479
‘She is meeting some friends tonight.’

02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:32.000
That's going to happen in the near future.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.080
You'll notice that we have 'she', so the ‘be’
verb is ‘is’.

02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:40.399
And then we added an ‘-ing’ to the end
of the verb ‘meet’.

02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:45.840
The next example says,
‘We are going on vacation in July.’

02:44:46.399 --> 02:44:50.719
The subject here is ‘we’, therefore we
use the ‘be’ verb ‘are’.

02:44:51.359 --> 02:44:57.200
We can also use a contraction and say,
‘We're going on vacation in July.’

02:44:57.200 --> 02:44:59.840
Again, another near future plan.

02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:02.241
The next example says,

02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:04.639
‘David is learning to drive tomorrow.’

02:45:05.279 --> 02:45:07.120
‘tomorrow’ is the near future.

02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:09.440
‘David’ is the subject.

02:45:10.319 --> 02:45:14.240
‘David’ is a ‘he’, so we use ‘is’.

02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:18.719
And lastly,
‘Vicki and I are teaching English next week.’

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.680
‘Vicky and I’…
If we think about the subject pronoun is ‘we’.

02:45:24.399 --> 02:45:28.000
That's why we used ‘are’.
‘We are teaching.’

02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:29.840
Let's move on.

02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:35.679
Now let's talk about the negative&nbsp;
form of the present continuous tense.

02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:37.760
I have some examples here.

02:45:38.479 --> 02:45:44.240
These two examples are for actions that are
happening right now, or longer actions.

02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:48.160
These last two are for near future plans.

02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:49.680
Let's take a look.

02:45:50.319 --> 02:45:53.599
The first sentence says,
‘I am not having fun.’

02:45:54.399 --> 02:45:57.759
Now that's not true for me because I am having
fun,

02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:00.800
but in this example I am not having fun.

02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:07.121
You'll notice that the word ‘not’ goes&nbsp;
between the ‘be’ verb and the ‘verb -ing’.

02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.479
In the second example it says,
‘Jane isn't doing her homework.’

02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:17.599
Here we use the contraction ‘isn't’ for ‘is not’,

02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:23.840
so just like the first sentence, we put ‘not’
between ‘is’ and ‘verb -ing’.

02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:28.081
The next sentence says,
‘You're not seeing him tonight.’

02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:31.680
Here we have a contraction for ‘you are’.

02:46:32.319 --> 02:46:34.719
‘You're not seeing him tonight.’

02:46:35.439 --> 02:46:39.040
And finally,
‘We are not running tomorrow morning.’

02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:43.920
Here we have the subject ‘we’, therefore,
we use the ‘be’ verb ‘are’.

02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:49.040
Don’t forget to add a ‘not’ after that
to make it negative.

02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:50.800
Let's move on.

02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:56.240
Now let's talk about how to form ‘be’ verb&nbsp;
questions in the present continuous tense.

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:58.960
The first example here says,

02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:02.319
‘Is he waiting for you?’

02:47:02.319 --> 02:47:03.040
or ‘Is he waiting for you?’

02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:04.560
We start with the ‘be’ verb.

02:47:05.359 --> 02:47:07.439
Take a look at the subject though.

02:47:07.439 --> 02:47:11.439
The subject is ‘he’ and that's why we
start with the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:13.200
‘Is he waiting for you?’

02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:18.399
You can answer, ‘Yes, he is.’ or ‘No he isn't.’

02:47:19.279 --> 02:47:20.960
The second sentence says,

02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:22.319
‘Are you coming to class?’

02:47:23.439 --> 02:47:27.359
The subject here is ‘you’ and&nbsp;
that's why we start with ‘are’.

02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:29.279
‘Are you coming to class?’

02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:33.840
You can answer, ‘Yes I am.’ or ‘No, I'm not.’

02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:39.279
The next question says,
‘Is he preparing to study in Canada?’

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:43.359
The subject is ‘he’, and so we start with ‘is’.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.600
The answer can be, ‘Yes, he is.’
or it can also be ‘No, he isn't.’

02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:54.560
Finally the last question says,
‘Are they going out tonight?’

02:47:55.359 --> 02:47:59.359
The subject here is ‘they’,
and so we start with ‘are’.

02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:05.279
The answer can be ‘Yes, they are.’
or ‘No, they aren't.’

02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:07.359
Let's move on.

02:48:07.359 --> 02:48:12.639
Now let's talk about the WH question&nbsp;
form for the present continuous tense.

02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:15.279
I have some examples here

02:48:15.279 --> 02:48:19.279
and you'll notice that we start with the
WH questions:

02:48:19.279 --> 02:48:23.920
what, where, when, who, why, and how.

02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:25.680
What comes after?

02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:32.800
You'll notice it's the ‘be’ verbs: ‘are’,
‘is’, and if the subject is ‘I’, ‘am’.

02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:38.960
So after that you have the subject and then
the verb -ing.

02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:41.840
Let's take a look at the first sentence.

02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:44.081
‘What are you doing?’

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:46.240
I'm asking about right now.

02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:48.559
For example, ‘I'm teaching English.’

02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:53.360
‘Where are you going?’
‘I'm going to the store.’

02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:58.560
‘When is it starting?’
‘It's starting at 3.’

02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:03.519
I can be talking about a movie a show anything
can be ‘it’.

02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:08.319
‘Who is she talking to?’
‘She's talking to Bob.’

02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:14.080
‘Why is she crying?’
‘She's crying because she's sad.’

02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:19.120
And finally, ‘How is it going?’
‘It's going well.’

02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:23.599
For this checkup of the present continuous tense,

02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:29.600
we'll look at how this tense can be used to&nbsp;
describe an action that's happening right now.

02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:31.520
Let's take a look at the first sentence.

02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:34.720
‘You -blank- learning English.’

02:49:35.359 --> 02:49:40.000
Remember for this tense, we start&nbsp;
with the subject and the ‘be’ verb

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:41.920
and then the verb ‘-ing’.

02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:47.120
We already have the verb ‘-ing’ here,
so we need the ‘be’ verb.

02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:50.319
The subject in the first sentence is ‘you’.

02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:55.359
For ‘you’, ‘we’, and ‘they’,&nbsp;
we use the ‘be’ verb - ‘are’,

02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:57.440
so the correct answer is,

02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:01.040
‘You are learning English’ right now.

02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:03.760
The next sentence says,

02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:06.880
‘She _blank_ not watching TV.’

02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:11.920
This is the negative form of&nbsp;
the present continuous tense.

02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:15.680
We have the word ‘not’ before the verb ‘-ing’,

02:50:16.399 --> 02:50:18.879
However, we're missing the ‘be’ verb again.

02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:22.960
What is the be verb to use&nbsp;
if the subject is ‘she’?

02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:25.840
the correct answer is ‘is’.

02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.760
‘She is not watching TV.’

02:50:31.439 --> 02:50:34.719
This one says, ‘I _blank_ studying now.’

02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:37.201
The subject here is ‘I’.

02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:42.000
Again think of the ‘be’ verb that goes
before the subject ‘I’.

02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:44.960
The ‘be’ verb is ‘am’.

02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:48.000
‘I am studying now.’

02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:53.200
We can also use a contraction and say,
‘I'm studying now’

02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:57.599
If we wanted to turn this into the negative form,

02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:00.960
we can also say, ‘I'm not studying now.’

02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:06.000
Now, take a look at the next&nbsp;
sentence and find the mistake.

02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:09.520
‘Layla is watch a movie.’

02:51:10.479 --> 02:51:15.200
Here we have the subject and the subject pronoun
for Layla would be ‘she’.

02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:18.640
We have the correct ‘be’ verb - ‘is’,

02:51:19.359 --> 02:51:25.120
However, you'll notice we forgot&nbsp;
the ‘-ing’ at the end of the verb.

02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:28.320
We need to say, ‘watching’.

02:51:29.279 --> 02:51:31.840
‘Layla is watching a movie.’

02:51:33.040 --> 02:51:34.479
The next sentence says,

02:51:34.479 --> 02:51:36.479
‘They playing soccer now.’

02:51:37.359 --> 02:51:38.160
What's missing?

02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:43.279
If you got it the correct answer is we need
the ‘be’ verb – ‘are’

02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:45.840
because the subject is ‘they’.

02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:49.360
‘They are playing soccer now.’

02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:53.040
And finally,
‘What do you do?’

02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:57.679
If you want to ask somebody&nbsp;
what they're doing right now,

02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:08.880
you say, 'what’... and the ‘be’ verb – ‘are...
you.. doing?’

02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:11.200
‘What are you doing?’

02:52:12.319 --> 02:52:13.840
Let's move on to the next practice.

02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:18.480
For this checkup we'll talk about the present
continuous tense

02:52:18.479 --> 02:52:24.399
and how it can be used to describe an action
that started in the past and continues today.

02:52:24.399 --> 02:52:25.839
It's a longer action.

02:52:26.399 --> 02:52:28.399
Let's take a look at the first sentence.

02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:32.640
‘He _blank_ studying economics.’

02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:38.480
Remember for this tense, we take the&nbsp;
subject, a ‘be’ verb, and then verb ‘-ing’.

02:52:39.279 --> 02:52:42.800
Here we already have the verb ‘-ing’, ‘studying’.

02:52:43.359 --> 02:52:44.960
So what are we missing?

02:52:44.960 --> 02:52:45.840
The ‘be’ verb.

02:52:46.399 --> 02:52:50.160
The correct ‘be’ verb for&nbsp;
the subject ‘he’ is ‘is’.

02:52:51.120 --> 02:52:54.080
So, ‘He is studying economics.’

02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:58.640
The next sentence says,
‘They're _blank_ for the fight.’

02:52:59.359 --> 02:53:01.679
The verb we want to use is ‘train’.

02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:05.680
Now we already have the 'be' verb here.

02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:09.840
It's in the contraction ‘there’&nbsp;
because it's ‘they are’.

02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:14.000
All we have to do now is add ‘-ing’ to the verb.

02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:20.080
‘They're training for the fight these days.’

02:53:20.800 --> 02:53:24.400
And ‘We _blank_ teaching at the school.’

02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:27.519
Again we're missing the ‘be’ verb.

02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:29.920
What is the ‘be’ verb for ‘we’?

02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:33.600
The correct answer is ‘are’.

02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:37.840
‘We are teaching at the school.’

02:53:38.399 --> 02:53:42.160
Now let's look for the&nbsp;
mistakes in the next sentence.

02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:46.240
‘Ben is study to become a doctor.’

02:53:47.279 --> 02:53:48.559
Can you find the error?

02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:54.160
Well we have the subject
and we have the proper ‘be verb’.

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:58.800
What we're missing is the ‘-ing’
at the end of ‘study’.

02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:06.160
The correct answer is,
‘Ben is studying to become a doctor’.

02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:07.840
Let's look at the next sentence.

02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:15.120
‘I don't reading that book.’

02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:15.202
hmm

02:54:15.202 --> 02:54:16.080
‘I don't reading that book.’

02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:21.840
To form the negative in the present continuous,
we don't use ‘do’ or ‘does’

02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:25.520
We use the ‘be’ verb.
What is the be verb for ‘I’?

02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:28.160
The correct answer is ‘am’.

02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:33.840
‘I am not reading that book.’

02:54:34.399 --> 02:54:37.120
There is no contraction for ‘am not’.

02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:42.000
Finally, ‘They are to learn English.’

02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:46.640
We have the subject and we have the correct
‘be’ verb,

02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:49.360
but remember we need verb ‘-ing’.

02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:52.880
Therefore, the correct answer is,

02:54:53.439 --> 02:54:56.799
‘They are learning English.’

02:54:57.680 --> 02:54:59.600
Let's move on to the next checkup.

02:55:00.479 --> 02:55:04.879
For this checkup we'll take a look at how
the present continuous tense

02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:07.840
can be used to talk about future plans.

02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:08.640
Let's take a look.

02:55:09.279 --> 02:55:13.920
The first sentence says,
‘They're play a game tonight.’

02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:16.160
The verb we want to use is ‘play’.

02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:20.880
Remember we start with the subject&nbsp;
and here we have it, ‘they’.

02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:24.000
Then we have the ‘be’ verb.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.960
In this case we used a contraction&nbsp;
for ‘they are – ‘they’re’.

02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:29.840
That's correct.

02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:35.520
After that we have to add ‘-ing’ to the
end of the verb,

02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:40.241
so the correct answer is,
‘They're playing a game tonight.’

02:55:41.359 --> 02:55:46.160
The next sentence says,
'We _blank_ not studying tomorrow.’

02:55:47.279 --> 02:55:49.679
Looks good but there's a word that's missing.

02:55:50.319 --> 02:55:53.519
This is the negative form because we have ‘not’.

02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:56.000
We simply need the ‘be’ verb for ‘we’.

02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:02.480
The correct ‘be’ verb is ‘are’.
‘We are not studying tomorrow.’

02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:08.000
The next sentence says,
‘Lynn is _blank_ out tonight.’

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.160
and we want to use the verb ‘go’.

02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:15.279
Remember 'Lynn' and then the ‘be’ verb – ‘is’.

02:56:15.279 --> 02:56:19.359
That's correct.
All we have to do is add ‘-ing’.

02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:24.081
‘Lynn is going out tonight.’

02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:27.120
To make this negative you can say,

02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:32.080
‘Lynn is not going out tonight.’ or
‘Lynn isn't going out tonight.’

02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:37.680
The next sentence says,
‘Laura isn't study this evening.’

02:56:38.479 --> 02:56:39.839
Can you find the mistake?

02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.920
Remember we have to add&nbsp;
‘-ing’ to the end of the verb,

02:56:46.479 --> 02:56:48.160
so we need to say,

02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:53.840
‘Laura isn't studying this evening.’

02:56:54.479 --> 02:56:56.080
The next sentence says,

02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:59.040
‘My sons will playing chess later.’

02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:02.400
We are talking about a future plan,

02:57:02.399 --> 02:57:06.799
so you might be tempted to use ‘well’
or ‘will’, I'm sorry.

02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:11.120
However, instead of saying ‘will’, we
use the ‘be’ verb.

02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:16.559
‘My sons are playing chess later.’

02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:22.161
And finally, ‘She's not to eating dinner tonight.’

02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:24.960
There's an extra word in here that we don't need.

02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:26.161
What is it?

02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:27.920
It's ‘to’.

02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:34.560
Remember, subject - ‘be’ verb, not verb ‘-ing’.

02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:37.360
We do not need ‘to’ in this sentence.

02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:41.040
All right well that's the end of this checkup.

02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:41.840
Let's move on.

02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:43.760
Good job, everyone.

02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:48.000
You just completed the lesson&nbsp;
on the present continuous tense.

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.200
This tense is not easy but you did a great job.

02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:53.279
And keep watching to learn more.

02:57:53.279 --> 02:57:58.160
I know English can be difficult but with practice
and effort you will improve.

02:57:58.160 --> 02:57:59.279
I promise.

02:57:59.279 --> 02:58:03.840
See you in the next video.

02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:10.640
Hi, everyone.

02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:11.760
I'm Esther.

02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:15.680
In this video, I'm going to introduce the
present perfect tense.

02:58:16.319 --> 02:58:21.120
This tense can be used to talk about an action
that happened in the past,

02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:25.279
but when it happened is not very important
or it’s unknown.

02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:32.000
It can also be used to talk about an action
that started in the past and continues in

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:32.640
the present.

02:58:33.279 --> 02:58:37.599
We really want to emphasize how long that
action has been happening.

02:58:38.319 --> 02:58:42.319
And finally, we use this tense to talk about
a recent action.

02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:47.439
There's a lot to learn and a lot of important
information, so keep watching.

02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:54.479
Let's talk about one usage of the present
perfect tense.

02:58:55.200 --> 02:59:00.240
This tense can be used to talk about an action
that happened in the past.

02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:04.559
But when it happened is not important or not
known.

02:59:05.439 --> 02:59:09.599
However, this action is&nbsp;
important to the conversation&nbsp;

02:59:09.600 --> 02:59:10.241
right now.

02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:12.640
Let's take a look at some examples.

02:59:13.359 --> 02:59:17.120
The first one says, ‘I have been to Canada.’

02:59:17.840 --> 02:59:21.120
What we do here is we start with the subject,
‘I’.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:26.080
For ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’, and ‘they’,
we follow with ‘have’.

02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:30.319
After that we use the past participle of the
verb.

02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:33.200
In this case, the verb is ‘be’.

02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:35.599
And so the past participle is ‘been’.

02:59:36.399 --> 02:59:38.399
‘I have been to Canada.’

02:59:39.279 --> 02:59:43.040
The next sentence says, ‘My cousins have
seen the movie.’

02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:45.680
My cousins is a ‘they’.

02:59:46.240 --> 02:59:48.800
And so again, we follow with ‘have’.

02:59:49.680 --> 02:59:53.201
And the past participle of see is ‘seen’.

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
‘They have seen the movie.’

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.560
Or ‘My cousins have seen the movie.’

02:59:59.920 --> 03:00:02.720
The next example says, ‘Chad has gone home.’

03:00:03.600 --> 03:00:05.040
Chad is a ‘he’.

03:00:05.920 --> 03:00:09.840
For ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’, we follow
with ‘has’.

03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:15.279
Then, the past participle ‘gone’ is for
the verb ‘go’.

03:00:16.160 --> 03:00:17.680
‘Chad has gone home.’

03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:21.600
And finally, ‘My phone has been fixed.’

03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:24.000
My phone is an ‘it’.

03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:26.560
Therefore, I use ‘has’.

03:00:27.279 --> 03:00:30.960
And then I need the past participle of ‘be’
– ‘been’.

03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:33.440
‘My phone has been fixed.’

03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:36.160
Let's move on to the next usage.

03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:42.640
The present perfect tense is also used to
describe an action that started in the past

03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:44.400
and continues in the present.

03:00:45.279 --> 03:00:50.319
‘for’ and since’ are common expressions
used with the present perfect tense.

03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:52.720
Let's take a look at these examples.

03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:56.720
‘I have worked there since 2002.’

03:00:57.520 --> 03:01:00.161
You'll notice we start with the subject.

03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:03.519
If it's ‘I’, ‘you’ or ‘we’, we
have ‘have’.

03:01:04.399 --> 03:01:07.359
Then the past participle of the verb.

03:01:07.359 --> 03:01:08.799
In this case - ‘worked’.

03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:13.920
What you'll notice here is that we also have
‘since 2002’.

03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:20.720
This shows when the action started, so with
the expression ‘since’, you need to use

03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:22.640
a specific point in time.

03:01:23.439 --> 03:01:25.439
The next example does the same thing.

03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:28.960
‘You have had a car since last year.’

03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:36.000
Again, we use ‘since’, so we have a specific
point in time - ‘last year’.

03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:38.720
Take a look at the next example.

03:01:39.439 --> 03:01:41.439
‘Anna has liked him for weeks.’

03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:44.479
In this case the subject is ‘Anna’.

03:01:44.479 --> 03:01:48.080
Which is a ‘she’, and so we use ‘has’.

03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:50.479
Then the past participle ‘liked’.

03:01:51.359 --> 03:01:56.160
However, at the end of the sentence, we see
‘for weeks’.

03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:57.599
Not ‘since weeks’.

03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:01.840
When we use ‘for’, we talk about the duration.

03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:05.200
We explain how long this action has been true.

03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:10.240
And finally, ‘We have eaten lunch here for
3 months.’

03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:14.880
Again, the sentence ends with ‘for 3 months’.

03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:16.720
So we show the duration.

03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:19.440
Let's move on to the next usage.

03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:26.640
In addition, the present perfect tense can
be used to describe an action that recently

03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:27.120
stopped.

03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:29.840
Let’s take a look at some examples.

03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:33.040
‘I have just been to the doctor,’

03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:37.680
So just like for all the other usages, we
start with the subject,

03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:41.360
‘have’ or ‘has’, and the past participle.

03:02:41.359 --> 03:02:47.359
But you'll notice here, I used the word ‘just’
between ‘have’ and the verb.

03:02:47.359 --> 03:02:49.679
‘I have just been to the doctor.’

03:02:50.319 --> 03:02:53.279
This shows that it happened very recently.

03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:58.960
The next example says, ‘James has just seen
his new baby.’

03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:04.560
Again, just goes in between ‘have’ or
‘has’ and the verb.

03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:07.920
Take a look at the next example.

03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:11.920
It says, ‘She has already been to China.’

03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:17.440
‘already’ is another word you can use
to show that this action recently happened.

03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:23.439
However, ‘already’ can also be moved to
the end of the sentence.

03:03:23.439 --> 03:03:28.399
So it's perfectly fine to say, ‘She has
been to China already.’

03:03:29.359 --> 03:03:33.759
And in the last example, ‘We have recently
visited Tom.’

03:03:34.479 --> 03:03:39.519
Again, you can put this word between ‘have’
or ‘has’ and the verb.

03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:43.201
Or you can also put it at the end of the sentence.

03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:45.519
‘We have visited Tom recently.’

03:03:46.319 --> 03:03:47.599
Let's move on.

03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:52.000
Let's take a look at the negative form of
the present perfect tense.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.080
Here are some examples.

03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:57.279
The first one says, ‘I have not been to
Europe.’

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:03.760
What you'll notice in the first sentence is
that we simply put a 'not' between ‘have’

03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:04.720
and ‘been’.

03:04:05.279 --> 03:04:07.840
‘I have not been to Europe.’

03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:13.600
You can also use a contraction and say ‘I
haven't been to Europe.’

03:04:14.479 --> 03:04:19.040
The next sentence says, ‘It has not rained
for 3 months.’

03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:24.160
Again, we put the ‘not’ between the ‘has’
and the verb.

03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:27.760
‘It has not rained for 3 months.’

03:04:28.399 --> 03:04:32.399
Here we have a time expression to show the
duration.

03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:38.241
The next example says, ‘Teddy hasn't driven
for 2 years.’

03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:43.040
We used the contraction here for ‘has’
and ‘not’ – ‘hasn't’.

03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:49.840
And then we use the time expression ‘for
2 years’ at the end of the sentence.

03:04:50.399 --> 03:04:57.120
And finally, the last sentence says, ‘My
sons haven't played soccer since 2010.’

03:04:57.760 --> 03:05:02.640
We see another contraction here for ‘have
not’ – ‘haven't’.

03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:06.960
‘My sons haven't played soccer since 2010.’

03:05:07.760 --> 03:05:10.480
This time expression uses ‘since’.

03:05:10.479 --> 03:05:13.599
And so we mention a specific point and time.

03:05:14.479 --> 03:05:15.279
Let's move on.

03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:21.279
Now let's take a look at the ‘have’ or
‘has’ question form of the present perfect

03:05:21.279 --> 03:05:21.679
tense.

03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:23.519
Take a look at the board.

03:05:24.319 --> 03:05:27.679
The first sentence says, ‘Mike has eaten
lunch.’

03:05:28.240 --> 03:05:29.599
That is a statement.

03:05:30.160 --> 03:05:33.040
Now to turn it into a question, it's quite
easy.

03:05:33.760 --> 03:05:36.640
All you have to do is put ‘has’ at the
beginning.

03:05:37.439 --> 03:05:42.319
Then you follow with the subject and then
the past participle.

03:05:42.319 --> 03:05:47.359
You'll notice that the placement of the past
participle doesn't change.

03:05:47.359 --> 03:05:50.799
We've simply changed the order of the first
2 words.

03:05:51.359 --> 03:05:53.040
‘Has Mike eaten lunch?’

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:55.600
‘Has Mike eaten lunch?’

03:05:56.240 --> 03:06:01.439
And you can answer by saying ‘Yes, he has.’
or ‘No, he hasn't.’

03:06:02.479 --> 03:06:05.919
The next sentence says, ‘They have watched
the video.’

03:06:06.800 --> 03:06:08.640
This is a statement.

03:06:08.640 --> 03:06:14.560
If we want to turn it into a question, again,
we change the order of the first two words.

03:06:15.279 --> 03:06:15.920
‘Have they…?’

03:06:16.640 --> 03:06:20.400
And the past participle verb stays in the
same place.

03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:25.760
‘Have they watched the video?’

03:06:25.760 --> 03:06:26.560
‘Have they watched the video?’

03:06:26.560 --> 03:06:30.400
You can answer this question by saying, ‘Yes,
they have.’

03:06:30.399 --> 03:06:32.160
or ‘No, they haven't.’

03:06:32.880 --> 03:06:34.080
Good job, guys.

03:06:34.080 --> 03:06:35.200
Let's move on.

03:06:35.200 --> 03:06:40.800
Now, I'll briefly introduce how to ask WH
questions in the present perfect tense.

03:06:41.439 --> 03:06:42.719
Take a look at the board.

03:06:43.279 --> 03:06:46.880
I have ‘where’, ‘what’, ‘who’,
and ‘how’.

03:06:47.439 --> 03:06:49.919
These go at the beginning of the question.

03:06:50.720 --> 03:06:52.720
Let's take a look at the first example.

03:06:53.439 --> 03:06:54.799
‘Where has Tim been?’

03:06:55.520 --> 03:07:00.480
You'll notice we followed the WH word with
‘has’ or ‘have’.

03:07:01.120 --> 03:07:06.720
In this case, I used ‘has’ because the
subject is ‘Tim’, and Tim is a ‘he’.

03:07:07.359 --> 03:07:11.519
And then we followed that with the past participle
of the verb.

03:07:12.160 --> 03:07:14.000
‘Where has Tim been?’

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:17.680
And I can answer by saying, ‘Tim has been
home.’

03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:20.480
or ‘Tim has been on vacation.’

03:07:20.479 --> 03:07:21.359
Something like that.

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:25.760
The next question says, what countries have
you visited?

03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:30.320
I can answer by saying, ‘I have visited
China.’

03:07:30.319 --> 03:07:32.240
or ‘I have visited Mexico.’

03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:35.600
You can also use the contraction ‘I’ve’.

03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:38.000
‘I've visited China.’

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:41.040
The next question says, ‘Who has she talked
to?’

03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:47.760
You can answer by saying, ‘She has talked
to her mom.’ or ‘She has talked to her

03:07:47.760 --> 03:07:48.160
teacher.’

03:07:49.279 --> 03:07:52.960
The next question says, ‘How long have you
been married?’

03:07:53.920 --> 03:07:55.920
‘I've been married for 3 years.’

03:07:56.479 --> 03:07:58.319
That's one answer that you can give.

03:07:59.040 --> 03:08:00.399
Great job, everybody.

03:08:00.399 --> 03:08:01.200
Let's move on.

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:05.840
For this checkup, we'll take a look at the
present perfect tense.

03:08:05.840 --> 03:08:08.560
Which describes an action that happened at

03:08:08.560 --> 03:08:12.081
an unknown or indefinite time in the past.

03:08:12.080 --> 03:08:13.680
Let's look at the first sentence.

03:08:14.319 --> 03:08:16.960
‘She _blank_ read that book.’

03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:20.161
The subject in this sentence is ‘she’.

03:08:20.800 --> 03:08:25.279
For he/she/it, in this tense we say, ‘has’.

03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:27.520
‘She has’.

03:08:28.240 --> 03:08:30.080
Now, take a look at the verb.

03:08:30.640 --> 03:08:32.320
It looks like ‘read’.

03:08:32.319 --> 03:08:36.719
But remember we need to use the past participle
of the verb.

03:08:36.720 --> 03:08:38.241
So It's actually ‘read’.

03:08:38.960 --> 03:08:41.040
‘read’ and ‘read’ are spelled the
same.

03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:43.760
‘She has read that book.’

03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:48.800
The second sentence says, ‘They _blank_
visit China.’

03:08:49.439 --> 03:08:52.080
‘visit’ is the verb that you want to use
here.

03:08:52.800 --> 03:08:57.040
For ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’ and ‘they’,
we use ‘have’.

03:08:57.600 --> 03:08:58.720
Not ‘has’.

03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:00.560
‘They have’

03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:04.000
Now, what's the past participle of visit?

03:09:04.560 --> 03:09:06.560
The answer is ‘visited’.

03:09:07.200 --> 03:09:10.319
‘They have visited China.’

03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:16.080
Next, ‘We _blank_ see that concert.’

03:09:16.080 --> 03:09:20.559
Again, for ‘I’, ‘you’, we’ and ‘they’
– we use ‘have’.

03:09:21.520 --> 03:09:22.320
‘We have’.

03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:26.960
Now, the past participle of ‘see’ is 'seen'.

03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:30.560
‘We have seen that concert.’

03:09:31.680 --> 03:09:34.960
Now, let's look for the mistake in the next
sentence.

03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:38.000
‘Rick have been to Cuba.’

03:09:38.640 --> 03:09:40.960
Take a look at the subject, ‘Rick’.

03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:43.120
Rick is a ‘he’.

03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:48.800
So instead of ‘have’, we need to change
this to ‘has’.

03:09:49.359 --> 03:09:51.599
‘Rick has been to Cuba.’

03:09:53.439 --> 03:09:56.399
‘Sally and I hasn't finished work.’

03:09:57.520 --> 03:10:00.800
The subject in this sentence is ‘Sally’
and ‘I’.

03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:03.920
The pronoun for that is ‘we’.

03:10:05.279 --> 03:10:07.200
‘We hasn't finished work.’

03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:09.680
That still sounds weird, right?

03:10:10.319 --> 03:10:17.200
We have to change this to ‘have not’ or
the contraction ‘haven't’.

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:21.439
And finally, ‘I did go to the doctor.’

03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:26.399
Now this sentence makes sense, but it's not
the present perfect tense.

03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:28.720
We have to change it.

03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:33.600
Remember, we use ‘have’ for the subject,
‘I’.

03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:35.359
But we're not done.

03:10:35.920 --> 03:10:40.480
What is the past participle of ‘go’?

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:43.359
It is ‘gone’.

03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:46.080
‘I have gone to the doctor.’

03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:47.760
Great job.

03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:49.520
Let's move on to the next checkup.

03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:53.840
In this checkup, we'll talk about the present
perfect tense

03:10:53.840 --> 03:10:59.600
and how it can be used to describe an action
that started in the past and is still true

03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:00.080
today.

03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:06.399
The first sentence says, ‘I _blank_ known
Carly since 1994.’

03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:08.399
The subject is ‘I’.

03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:13.279
And we already have the past participle of
the verb, ‘know’.

03:11:13.279 --> 03:11:14.559
Which is ‘known’.

03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:16.080
What are we missing?

03:11:16.720 --> 03:11:18.800
The correct answer is ‘have’.

03:11:19.359 --> 03:11:25.040
For ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’ and ‘they’,
we use ‘have’ after the subject.

03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:27.600
The next sentence says,

03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:30.720
‘He has been here _blank_ 2 p.m.’

03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:34.480
Now the first part is all there.

03:11:34.479 --> 03:11:35.839
‘He has been’.

03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:40.000
However, remember that for the present perfect
tense,

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:45.279
we use ‘for’ or ‘since’ to talk about
how long that action has been true.

03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:48.239
In this case, we use ‘since’.

03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:53.120
Because 2 p.m. is a specific period in time.

03:11:54.319 --> 03:11:58.799
Next it says, ‘She _blank_ liked Tom since
June.’

03:11:59.439 --> 03:12:01.599
The subject is ‘she’.

03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:06.640
And we have the past participle of the verb
‘like’, which is 'liked'.

03:12:07.279 --> 03:12:08.239
What are we missing?

03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:11.520
Again, we need ‘have’ or ‘has’.

03:12:12.239 --> 03:12:14.319
Because the subject is ‘she’...

03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:17.920
Can you figure out which one you need?

03:12:17.920 --> 03:12:19.920
The correct answer is ‘has’.

03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:23.840
‘She has liked Tom since June.’

03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:28.560
Now, I want you to find a mistake in the next
sentence.

03:12:29.279 --> 03:12:32.559
‘I have worked here six months ago.’

03:12:33.359 --> 03:12:34.799
Can you find a mistake here?

03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:38.320
‘I have worked’ - that's correct.

03:12:38.960 --> 03:12:43.439
However, in the present perfect tense, we
don't use ‘ago’.

03:12:44.479 --> 03:12:47.599
This is talking about more the past.

03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:51.280
We want to talk about ‘since’ or ‘for’
instead.

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:55.600
Now ‘six months’ is not a specific time.

03:12:55.600 --> 03:12:57.360
So we don't use ‘since’.

03:12:58.319 --> 03:13:01.200
Instead, we talk about the duration.

03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:02.639
So we need ‘for’.

03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:07.760
We'll say, ‘I have worked here for six months.’

03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:10.640
Let's take a look at the next sentence.

03:13:11.439 --> 03:13:14.319
‘Jen have a cold for two weeks.’

03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:18.720
At first glance, this doesn't seem that wrong.

03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:22.000
But remember, Jen is a ‘she’.

03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:23.760
So we need ‘has’.

03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:26.080
‘Jen has’.

03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:29.760
But wait a minute, ‘Jen has have a cold’?

03:13:30.319 --> 03:13:32.080
That's not right either.

03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:34.640
We need the past participle of ‘have’.

03:13:35.359 --> 03:13:37.120
What is the past participle?

03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:39.840
The correct answer is ‘had’.

03:13:40.720 --> 03:13:44.880
‘Jen has had a cold for two weeks.’

03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:50.080
And finally, ‘We haven't went home since
Friday.’

03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:52.880
This one is a little tricky.

03:13:52.880 --> 03:13:54.239
The subject is ‘we’.

03:13:55.040 --> 03:13:56.640
‘We have... have not’.

03:13:56.640 --> 03:13:57.840
That's correct.

03:13:57.840 --> 03:13:59.760
The contraction is ‘haven't’.

03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:00.560
‘We haven't’.

03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:04.639
Now the problem is, we have this verb ‘went’.

03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:07.599
That's in the past simple tense.

03:14:08.319 --> 03:14:11.040
We need the past participle of ‘go’.

03:14:12.479 --> 03:14:14.719
The correct answer is ‘gone’.

03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:19.760
‘We haven't gone home since Friday.’

03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:21.760
Good job, guys.

03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:23.920
Let's move on to the next checkup.

03:14:23.920 --> 03:14:27.840
In this checkup, we'll take a look at the
present perfect tense.

03:14:27.840 --> 03:14:31.840
And how it is used to describe an action that
finished recently.

03:14:32.479 --> 03:14:37.919
We'll be focusing on the words, ‘just’,
‘already’ and ‘recently’ to show this.

03:14:37.920 --> 03:14:39.920
Let's take a look at the first sentence.

03:14:40.560 --> 03:14:43.520
‘She has just _blank_ that book.’

03:14:43.520 --> 03:14:45.360
And we're using the verb, ‘read’.

03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:48.639
Remember, we take the subject, ‘she’.

03:14:49.279 --> 03:14:53.200
And for ‘he’, ‘she’ and ‘it’,
we say ‘has’.

03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:54.720
So that's correct.

03:14:54.720 --> 03:14:57.840
Now we need the past participle of ‘read’.

03:14:58.399 --> 03:14:59.679
And that is ‘read’.

03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:04.960
‘She has just read that book.’

03:15:05.520 --> 03:15:10.240
You'll notice I use the word, ‘just’ right
before the past participle.

03:15:11.359 --> 03:15:16.319
Next it says, ‘They have already’ and
the verb is ‘wake up’.

03:15:17.680 --> 03:15:21.920
If the subject is ‘he’, ‘she’, or
‘it’, we use ‘has’.

03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:28.161
But if the subject is ‘I’, ‘you’,
‘we’ or ‘they’, we use ‘have’.

03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:29.439
So that's correct.

03:15:29.439 --> 03:15:30.160
‘They have’.

03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:36.080
Also we have the word ‘already’ here
to show that it happened recently

03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:37.920
or that it finished recently.

03:15:38.479 --> 03:15:40.399
Now the verb is ‘wake up’.

03:15:40.960 --> 03:15:44.399
We need the past participle of ‘wake up’,

03:15:44.399 --> 03:15:47.839
and that is ‘woken up’.

03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:51.920
So the answer is,

03:15:51.920 --> 03:15:54.319
‘They have already woken up.’

03:15:55.279 --> 03:15:56.880
The next sentence says,

03:15:56.880 --> 03:15:59.600
‘We have recently _blank_ work.’

03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:02.000
And the verb is ‘finish’.

03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:05.120
‘We have’, that's correct.

03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:09.040
And we have the word 'recently' to show when
the action finished.

03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:13.279
And now we need to find the past participle
of the verb ‘finish’.

03:16:13.920 --> 03:16:15.680
The correct answer is.

03:16:15.680 --> 03:16:21.600
‘We have recently finished, -ed, work.’

03:16:22.560 --> 03:16:26.400
Now try to find the mistake in the next sentence.

03:16:27.439 --> 03:16:29.839
‘Morty has eaten just.’

03:16:30.560 --> 03:16:32.560
This sounds a little strange, right?

03:16:33.279 --> 03:16:37.519
That's because ‘just’ needs to come before
the verb.

03:16:38.800 --> 03:16:42.560
Therefore, the answer is ‘Morty has just
eaten.’

03:16:43.760 --> 03:16:48.480
The next sentence says, ‘Karen has recently
be sick.’

03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:51.040
Karen is a ‘she’.

03:16:51.760 --> 03:16:53.680
So ‘has’ is correct.

03:16:54.239 --> 03:16:56.239
And there we have ‘recently’.

03:16:56.960 --> 03:17:00.239
Now we need the past participle of the verb.

03:17:01.520 --> 03:17:06.081
‘be’ is our verb and the past participle
of ‘be’ is ‘been’.

03:17:07.200 --> 03:17:09.760
‘Karen has recently been sick.’

03:17:10.720 --> 03:17:14.960
And finally, ‘I have gone already to the
dentist.’

03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:19.121
This is similar to another question we looked
at just before.

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.880
‘I have gone already to the dentist.’

03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:28.000
The placement of ‘already’ is a little
awkward.

03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:32.880
So we can say, ‘I have already gone.’

03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:35.920
So we can put ‘already’ before the verb,

03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:38.720
‘I have already gone to the dentist’

03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:41.280
Or we can put this at the end,

03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:44.880
‘I have gone to the dentist already.’

03:17:45.520 --> 03:17:47.121
Both of those are correct.

03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:49.200
Now, good job.

03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:50.960
That is the end of the checkup.

03:17:50.960 --> 03:17:51.760
Let's move on.

03:17:52.720 --> 03:17:54.240
Excellent job, everyone.

03:17:54.239 --> 03:17:57.359
You just learned about the present perfect
tense.

03:17:57.359 --> 03:18:00.239
There was a lot to learn, but you did a wonderful
job.

03:18:00.800 --> 03:18:02.160
Keep studying English.

03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:07.200
I know that It's hard, but you will get better
with time, effort and practice.

03:18:07.200 --> 03:18:08.639
I'll see you in the next video.

03:18:17.200 --> 03:18:18.160
Hi, everyone.

03:18:18.160 --> 03:18:19.359
Welcome to the video.

03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:24.640
In this video, I’ll introduce the Present
Perfect Continuous English Tense.

03:18:25.359 --> 03:18:28.399
This tense can be used to talk about an action

03:18:28.399 --> 03:18:31.759
that started in the past and continues in
the present.

03:18:32.319 --> 03:18:37.279
It can also be used to talk about an action
that hasn't happened recently.

03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:42.960
And finally, it can also be used to talk about
an action that recently stopped.

03:18:43.520 --> 03:18:45.760
There's a lot to learn, so keep watching.

03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:52.640
You can use the present perfect continuous
tense

03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:57.680
to talk about an action that started in the
past and continues in the present.

03:18:58.319 --> 03:19:00.639
We want to emphasize duration

03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:05.201
and you can do that by using ‘for’ or
‘since’ in your sentence.

03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:07.040
Let's take a look at some examples.

03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:11.439
‘Charles has been studying English for an
hour.’

03:19:12.319 --> 03:19:14.719
Take a look at the subject, ‘Charles’.

03:19:15.279 --> 03:19:17.840
The subject pronoun for Charles is ‘he’.

03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:20.320
And that's why we say ‘has’.

03:19:21.200 --> 03:19:25.760
After that, we add ‘been’ and then verb
‘-ing’.

03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:27.360
In this case, ‘studying.’

03:19:28.319 --> 03:19:32.719
You'll also notice that at the end of the
sentence we have for an hour.

03:19:33.359 --> 03:19:36.639
That shows how long this&nbsp;
action has been happening.

03:19:37.279 --> 03:19:42.239
When you use ‘for’, you emphasize the
duration. ‘for an hour’.

03:19:42.960 --> 03:19:46.160
‘Charles has been studying English for an
hour.’

03:19:47.279 --> 03:19:49.279
Let's take a look at the next sentence.

03:19:50.080 --> 03:19:53.439
‘Lily has been playing the piano for 2 years.’

03:19:54.080 --> 03:20:00.080
In this case, Lily is a ‘she’ and that's
why, again, we say ‘has’.

03:20:00.080 --> 03:20:04.160
You'll notice again, we have ‘been’ and
then verb ‘-ing’.

03:20:04.720 --> 03:20:06.080
In this case, ‘playing’.

03:20:07.040 --> 03:20:10.160
At the end of this sentence, we also used
‘for’.

03:20:10.800 --> 03:20:12.880
and then ‘two years’.

03:20:12.880 --> 03:20:16.720
So again, we're showing how long this has
been happening.

03:20:17.760 --> 03:20:19.840
The next sentence is a little different.

03:20:20.479 --> 03:20:22.799
‘It has been growing since June.’

03:20:23.359 --> 03:20:26.000
So it can be something like a plant.

03:20:26.640 --> 03:20:30.720
The plant or it has been growing since June.

03:20:31.520 --> 03:20:34.320
Here we use ‘since’, not ‘for’.

03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:36.080
What's the difference?

03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:39.840
We use a specific point in time with since.

03:20:40.399 --> 03:20:43.120
We don't say ‘Since two hours’.

03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:47.120
No, we say ‘When the action started since
June.’

03:20:47.920 --> 03:20:52.800
And finally, ‘Dan and I have been working
since 6 a.m.’

03:20:53.680 --> 03:20:56.560
The subject pronoun for ‘Dan and I’ is
‘We’.

03:20:57.279 --> 03:20:58.800
Therefore we use ‘have’.

03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:03.840
At the end of the sentence, we have ‘since
6 a.m.’

03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:10.081
Remember that with ‘since’, we talked
about a specific point in time when the action

03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:10.559
started.

03:21:11.279 --> 03:21:12.080
Let's move on.

03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:18.160
The present perfect continuous can also be
used without emphasizing duration.

03:21:18.880 --> 03:21:21.520
In this case, we mean ‘lately’.

03:21:21.520 --> 03:21:23.840
This action has been happening ‘lately’,

03:21:24.560 --> 03:21:29.520
and so we can use the word ‘lately’ or
‘recently’ to explain this.

03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:31.920
Let's take a look at some examples.

03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:35.840
‘You have been missing many classes lately.’

03:21:36.399 --> 03:21:40.879
You'll notice that at the end of the sentence
I use the word ‘lately'

03:21:40.880 --> 03:21:43.760
to describe when this action has been happening.

03:21:44.399 --> 03:21:48.080
You can also use lately at the beginning of
the sentence.

03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:52.399
For example, ‘Lately, you have been missing
many classes.’

03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:58.480
The next example says, ‘Recently, Toby has
been running every day.’

03:21:59.279 --> 03:22:02.800
In this sentence, we used ‘recently’ at
the beginning

03:22:02.800 --> 03:22:06.080
to show when does action has been happening.

03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:09.760
You can also use ‘recently’ at the end
of the sentence.

03:22:09.760 --> 03:22:12.480
‘Toby has been running everyday recently.’

03:22:13.439 --> 03:22:19.439
In this example, the subject is Toby and so
we use ‘has’ after Toby.

03:22:19.439 --> 03:22:21.439
Because Toby is a ‘he’.

03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:26.800
The next example says, ‘Lately, Dana has
been swimming a lot.’

03:22:27.439 --> 03:22:31.359
Again, we use ‘lately’ at the beginning
of this sentence,

03:22:31.359 --> 03:22:33.839
but you can also use it at the end.

03:22:34.479 --> 03:22:38.719
Dana is a ‘she’ and so we followed this
subject with ‘has’.

03:22:39.760 --> 03:22:44.720
And finally, ‘We've been practicing English
together recently.’

03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:49.280
‘We’ is the subject of this sentence and
so we use ‘have’.

03:22:49.920 --> 03:22:53.440
Here, we use the contraction ‘We’ve’.

03:22:53.439 --> 03:22:56.239
‘We have’ become ‘We've’.

03:22:56.240 --> 03:22:59.680
‘We've been practicing English together
recently.’

03:22:59.680 --> 03:23:02.080
We can put ‘recently’ at the end,

03:23:02.080 --> 03:23:06.880
or we can say ‘Recently we've been practicing
English together.’

03:23:07.680 --> 03:23:08.480
Let's move on.

03:23:09.600 --> 03:23:15.520
The present perfect continuous tense and also
be used to talk about an action that recently

03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:18.000
stopped and has a present result.

03:23:18.640 --> 03:23:20.400
Let's take a look at the example.

03:23:21.120 --> 03:23:24.000
‘I'm tired because I have been running.’

03:23:24.640 --> 03:23:27.440
The second part of the sentence, ‘I have
been running’

03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:30.880
is using the present perfect continuous tense.

03:23:31.439 --> 03:23:34.239
This is the action that recently stopped.

03:23:34.239 --> 03:23:37.279
And as a result, ‘I'm tired’.

03:23:37.279 --> 03:23:39.519
This is the present result.

03:23:39.520 --> 03:23:42.161
What's happening now, because of this.

03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:44.160
‘I'm tired.’.

03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:48.960
The next example says, ‘The street is wet
because it has been raining.’

03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:52.560
This is very similar to the first sentence.

03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:55.121
Here, we know that it has been raining.

03:23:55.120 --> 03:23:58.080
And this action recently stopped.

03:23:58.080 --> 03:24:02.239
As a result, in the present, The street is
wet.

03:24:02.239 --> 03:24:06.160
The street is wet right now because of this
action.

03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:13.201
The next example says, ‘You don't understand
because you haven't been listening.’

03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:16.880
You'll notice here that we use the negative.

03:24:16.880 --> 03:24:20.160
Here's the contractions, ‘haven't’ or
‘have not’

03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:24.480
because of this action,&nbsp;
you haven't been listening,

03:24:24.479 --> 03:24:26.879
now you don't understand.

03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:31.040
In the last example, we switch the order a
little bit.

03:24:31.760 --> 03:24:33.920
‘I've been studying all night.’

03:24:34.479 --> 03:24:37.679
There is the present perfect continuous tense.

03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:39.840
This is the action that stopped recently.

03:24:40.399 --> 03:24:42.239
And here is the result.

03:24:42.239 --> 03:24:44.239
‘Now, I'm exhausted.’

03:24:44.960 --> 03:24:46.239
Great job, everyone.

03:24:46.239 --> 03:24:47.040
Let's move on.

03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:52.720
Let's take a look at the negative form of
the present perfect continuous tense.

03:24:52.720 --> 03:24:53.840
Here are some examples.

03:24:54.960 --> 03:24:57.760
‘I have not been feeling well these days.’

03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:04.000
At the end of the sentence we have ‘these
days’ to show that this is an action that's

03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:05.520
been happening recently.

03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:09.279
In the negative form, we have to have ‘not’.

03:25:10.080 --> 03:25:13.680
The ‘not’ goes after have or has.

03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:17.520
In this case, the subject is ‘I’, so I
use ‘have’.

03:25:18.239 --> 03:25:22.080
‘I have not been feeling well these days.’

03:25:22.080 --> 03:25:26.239
We can also use a contraction ‘haven't’
or ‘have not’.

03:25:26.239 --> 03:25:29.200
‘I haven't been feeling well these days.’

03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:34.000
The next sentence says, ‘Sue has not been
cooking lately.’

03:25:34.720 --> 03:25:37.920
We have ‘lately’ at the end of this sentence,

03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:41.200
We can also put ‘lately’ at the beginning
of the sentence.

03:25:41.760 --> 03:25:45.920
The important part of this sentence is to
put ‘not’ after ‘has’.

03:25:46.640 --> 03:25:48.320
Why did we use ‘has’?

03:25:48.319 --> 03:25:51.840
Because the subject is ‘Sue’ which is
a 'she'.

03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:54.480
For ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’, we use
‘has’.

03:25:55.120 --> 03:25:59.279
Again, we can use a contraction ‘hasn't’
for has not.

03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:02.560
‘Sue hasn't been cooking lately.’

03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:09.121
The next sentence says, ‘Jeff hasn't been
eating healthy food recently.’

03:26:09.760 --> 03:26:15.120
Again, the ‘recently’ can be used at the
beginning or end of this sentence.

03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:18.960
We have the contestant ‘hasn't’ here for
you.

03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:22.240
‘hasn't’ is a contraction for ‘has not’.

03:26:22.800 --> 03:26:26.880
We have ‘has’ because the subject is Jeff
which is ‘he’.

03:26:27.680 --> 03:26:32.320
And finally, ‘They haven't been speaking
for over a year.’

03:26:33.120 --> 03:26:36.640
In this case, ‘for over a year’ shows
duration.

03:26:37.279 --> 03:26:41.679
Remember with ‘for’, you show how long
something has been happening.

03:26:42.319 --> 03:26:46.399
In this case, we have a contraction ‘haven't’
or ‘have not’.

03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:48.559
Great job, everybody.

03:26:48.560 --> 03:26:49.920
let's move on.

03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:54.160
Now, let's take a look at how to form the
‘have’ or ‘has’ question

03:26:54.160 --> 03:26:56.559
for the present perfect continuous tense.

03:26:57.359 --> 03:27:01.359
The first sentence says, ‘He has been reading
for an hour,’

03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.720
Now, to turn this into a question,

03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:08.720
all we have to do is change the order of the
first two words.

03:27:09.279 --> 03:27:12.319
So ‘He has’ becomes ‘Has he’.

03:27:13.200 --> 03:27:15.439
‘Has he been reading for an hour?’

03:27:16.239 --> 03:27:19.920
You'll notice that the second part of the
sentence doesn't change.

03:27:20.640 --> 03:27:22.640
‘Has he been reading for an hour?’

03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:28.640
To answer, you can simply say, ‘Yes, he
has.’ or ‘No, he hasn't.’

03:27:29.359 --> 03:27:33.279
The next sentence says, ‘They have been
sleeping since 8 p.m.’

03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:38.000
Again, the second part of the sentence stays
the same,

03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:41.120
and in the beginning, we just switch the first
two words.

03:27:41.680 --> 03:27:43.840
‘They have’ become ‘Have they’.

03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:46.640
‘Have they been sleeping since 8 p.m.?’

03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:51.041
To answer, you can say, ‘Yes, they have.’

03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:53.040
or ‘No. they haven't.’

03:27:53.840 --> 03:27:55.120
Great job, everybody.

03:27:55.120 --> 03:27:55.840
Let's move on.

03:27:56.640 --> 03:28:02.800
Now, let's take a look at how to form WH questions
in the present perfect continuous tense.

03:28:03.439 --> 03:28:06.719
Here, we have some WH question words.

03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:10.080
‘what’, ‘where’, ‘why’ and ‘how’.

03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:12.000
Let's take a look at the first question.

03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:14.640
‘What have you been doing lately?’

03:28:15.439 --> 03:28:18.639
I can answer by saying,
‘I have been working.’

03:28:18.640 --> 03:28:20.800
or ‘I have been studying.’

03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:23.147
I can also use the contraction ‘I've’.

03:28:23.146 --> 03:28:25.359
‘I've been working.’

03:28:25.359 --> 03:28:26.399
‘I've been studying.’

03:28:27.120 --> 03:28:30.319
The next question says, ‘Where have you
been traveling?’

03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:33.359
‘I have been traveling in Europe.’

03:28:33.359 --> 03:28:35.759
or ‘I've been traveling in Europe.’

03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:39.359
‘Why has he been feeling sad?’

03:28:40.080 --> 03:28:43.760
You can answer by saying, ‘He's been feeling
sad.’

03:28:43.760 --> 03:28:49.440
That's the contraction ‘he has’, he's
been feeling sad because his pet died.

03:28:50.319 --> 03:28:55.200
or ‘He has been feeling sad because he broke
up with his girlfriend.’

03:28:55.200 --> 03:28:56.080
Something like that.

03:28:56.640 --> 03:28:58.880
And ‘How has she been doing?’

03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:01.360
‘How has she been doing?’

03:29:01.359 --> 03:29:03.679
I can say, ‘She's been doing well.’

03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:07.120
‘She's’ is a contraction for ‘she has’.

03:29:07.920 --> 03:29:09.200
Great job, everyone.

03:29:09.200 --> 03:29:10.000
Let's move on.

03:29:10.560 --> 03:29:15.040
In this checkup, we will talk about the present
perfect continuous tense.

03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:18.960
This tense can be used to describe an event

03:29:18.960 --> 03:29:22.319
that started in the past and continues in
the present.

03:29:22.880 --> 03:29:23.680
Let's take a look.

03:29:24.479 --> 03:29:26.080
The first sentence says,

03:29:26.080 --> 03:29:28.640
‘He has _blank_ all week,’

03:29:28.640 --> 03:29:30.000
And the verb is ‘sleep’.

03:29:30.800 --> 03:29:35.120
For this tense, what we do is we first look
at the subject, ‘he’.

03:29:35.920 --> 03:29:39.440
For ‘he’, ‘she’ and ‘it’, we put
‘has’.

03:29:40.960 --> 03:29:44.720
Then, we add ‘been’.
‘has been’.

03:29:45.600 --> 03:29:48.640
Finally we add ‘-ing’ to the end.

03:29:49.359 --> 03:29:53.599
‘He has been sleeping all week.’

03:29:54.479 --> 03:29:58.719
The next sentence says,
‘You haven't _blank_ for a year.’

03:29:59.359 --> 03:30:01.920
and the verb is ‘travel’.

03:30:01.920 --> 03:30:04.319
Now, this is the negative form.

03:30:04.319 --> 03:30:06.719
So you see the contraction - ‘haven't’.

03:30:06.720 --> 03:30:09.280
‘You have not’ or ‘You haven't’.

03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:13.279
Again, what we do after that is add ‘been’.

03:30:15.520 --> 03:30:17.600
Then, do you remember what to do?

03:30:18.399 --> 03:30:20.479
Add ‘-ing’ to the verb.

03:30:25.520 --> 03:30:28.240
‘You haven't been traveling for a year.’

03:30:29.600 --> 03:30:33.600
Next, it says ‘They _blank_ working all
day.’

03:30:34.319 --> 03:30:38.160
So the verb ‘-ing’ has already been provided
for you.

03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:41.680
Now, take a look at the subject.

03:30:41.680 --> 03:30:44.000
The subject is ‘they’.

03:30:44.000 --> 03:30:46.960
Should we use ‘have’?
or should we use ‘has’?

03:30:47.680 --> 03:30:49.760
The correct answer is ‘have’.

03:30:51.359 --> 03:30:52.319
Then what do you put?

03:30:53.200 --> 03:30:55.120
Remember, we put ‘been’.

03:30:57.040 --> 03:30:59.279
‘They have been working all day.’

03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:03.040
Now if you want to make this negative,
you can say,

03:31:03.040 --> 03:31:05.359
‘They haven't been working all day.’

03:31:06.399 --> 03:31:09.120
Now find the mistake in the next sentence.

03:31:09.760 --> 03:31:16.480
‘My friends have been watch TV.’

03:31:16.479 --> 03:31:17.120
‘My friends have been watch TV.’

03:31:17.120 --> 03:31:18.080
What's the mistake?

03:31:19.040 --> 03:31:24.239
Remember, we need to add ‘-ing’ to the
end of the verb.

03:31:24.800 --> 03:31:27.440
So we should say,

03:31:27.439 --> 03:31:30.000
‘My friends have been watching TV.’

03:31:31.600 --> 03:31:35.440
Next, ‘Sal did talking for 10 minutes.’

03:31:36.200 --> 03:31:37.200
Hmm..

03:31:37.200 --> 03:31:38.399
Sal is a ‘he'.

03:31:39.279 --> 03:31:42.080
And ‘talking’ is already there for you.

03:31:42.080 --> 03:31:45.200
So what's in the middle of those two words
is the mistake.

03:31:47.680 --> 03:31:49.520
For ‘he’, we use ‘has’.

03:31:50.160 --> 03:31:54.080
So we say ‘has been’.

03:31:54.080 --> 03:31:56.559
‘Sal has been talking for 10 minutes.’

03:31:57.600 --> 03:31:58.800
And finally,

03:31:58.800 --> 03:32:01.840
‘He has been to eat for an hour.’

03:32:02.680 --> 03:32:03.680
Hmm..

03:32:03.680 --> 03:32:06.720
‘He has been’
That's correct.

03:32:06.720 --> 03:32:12.240
However, in this sentence, the base form of
the verb ‘eat’ was used.

03:32:12.239 --> 03:32:14.960
Instead, remember we need ‘-ing’.

03:32:19.840 --> 03:32:22.160
This is the correct answer.

03:32:22.160 --> 03:32:24.639
‘He has been eating for an hour.’

03:32:25.600 --> 03:32:28.640
All right, good job.
and let's move on to the next practice.

03:32:29.680 --> 03:32:34.400
In this practice, we'll take a look at the
present perfect continuous tense,

03:32:34.399 --> 03:32:39.759
And see how it expresses an action that has
been happening recently or lately.

03:32:39.760 --> 03:32:41.680
Let's take a look at the first sentence.

03:32:42.560 --> 03:32:46.081
‘She has _blank_ bad lately.’

03:32:46.080 --> 03:32:47.680
And the verb is ‘feel’.

03:32:48.479 --> 03:32:51.679
Remember for ‘she’, we use ‘has’.

03:32:52.560 --> 03:32:56.320
Then don't forget we need to have ‘been’.

03:32:56.960 --> 03:32:57.920
‘She has been’

03:32:58.800 --> 03:33:03.840
After that, we add ‘-ing’ to the verb.

03:33:05.760 --> 03:33:07.680
The correct sentence is,

03:33:07.680 --> 03:33:10.160
‘She has been feeling bad lately.’

03:33:11.040 --> 03:33:12.720
The next sentence says,

03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:16.080
‘We haven't _blank_ much recently.’

03:33:16.080 --> 03:33:17.840
And the verb is ‘cook’.

03:33:18.479 --> 03:33:20.479
This is a negative sentence.

03:33:20.479 --> 03:33:24.639
So we say, ‘We have not’ or the contraction
- ‘haven't’.

03:33:25.200 --> 03:33:31.840
‘We haven't’
Don't forget ‘been’, and then verb ‘-ing’.

03:33:32.479 --> 03:33:36.959
‘We haven't been cooking much recently.’

03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:41.600
Finally, we move on, let's try to find the
mistake.

03:33:43.120 --> 03:33:46.319
‘We has been riding bikes to school recently.’

03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:49.040
What's the mistake in this sentence?

03:33:50.399 --> 03:33:51.920
The subject here is ‘We’.

03:33:52.720 --> 03:33:58.880
For ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’ and ‘they’,
we have to say ‘have been’, not ‘has

03:33:58.880 --> 03:33:59.840
been’.

03:34:02.960 --> 03:34:06.000
‘We have been riding bikes to school recently.’

03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:08.399
And for the last one,

03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:11.840
‘Jenny lately hasn't been helping me.’

03:34:13.120 --> 03:34:16.239
The lately is placed wrong in this sentence.

03:34:16.800 --> 03:34:17.840
We have to say,

03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:23.200
‘Lately, Jenny hasn't been helping me.’

03:34:23.760 --> 03:34:28.000
or we can also say,

03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:30.640
‘Jenny hasn't been helping me lately.’

03:34:31.520 --> 03:34:33.840
Let's move on to the next checkup.

03:34:33.840 --> 03:34:38.480
In this checkup, we'll talk about the present
perfect continuous tense

03:34:38.479 --> 03:34:42.080
and how it expresses an action that stopped
recently

03:34:42.080 --> 03:34:43.840
but has a present result.

03:34:44.720 --> 03:34:46.080
The first sentence says,

03:34:46.080 --> 03:34:49.359
‘I _blank_ . That's why I'm so sweaty.’

03:34:50.399 --> 03:34:52.639
The verb here is ‘exercise’.

03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:54.161
And the subject is ‘I’.

03:34:54.960 --> 03:34:58.239
Do we use ‘has’ or ‘have’ for the
subject ‘I’?

03:34:58.880 --> 03:35:00.800
The correct answer is ‘have’.

03:35:03.359 --> 03:35:09.839
Then, we put ‘been’ and then verb ‘-ing’.

03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:16.880
Okay, so the correct answer is,

03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:19.120
‘I have been exercising.

03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:21.120
That's why I'm so sweaty.’

03:35:21.120 --> 03:35:22.160
That's the result.

03:35:22.960 --> 03:35:24.480
The next sentence says,

03:35:24.479 --> 03:35:28.000
‘I'm covered in flour because I _blank_.’

03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:29.439
And the verb is ‘bake’.

03:35:30.640 --> 03:35:31.201
Take a look.

03:35:31.840 --> 03:35:35.600
I have ‘I'm covered in flour because’

03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:38.320
So this first part is the result.

03:35:38.319 --> 03:35:44.000
I need to show the action that stopped recently
in the present perfect continuous tense.

03:35:44.640 --> 03:35:46.880
Again, the subject is ‘I’.

03:35:46.880 --> 03:35:48.800
So we use ‘have been’.

03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:55.439
Then, all we do is add ‘-ing’ to the end
of baking.

03:35:59.120 --> 03:36:00.640
‘I have been baking.’

03:36:00.640 --> 03:36:01.520
So again,

03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:06.000
‘I'm covered in flour because
I have been baking.’

03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:08.720
And we can use the contraction and say,

03:36:08.720 --> 03:36:10.240
‘I've been baking.’

03:36:11.439 --> 03:36:14.160
Now, find the mistake in the next sentence.

03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:20.240
‘She has think a lot, so she has a headache.’

03:36:21.200 --> 03:36:21.840
Take a look.

03:36:23.279 --> 03:36:26.239
The result is that ‘she has a headache.’

03:36:26.239 --> 03:36:30.559
So we need to use the present perfect continuous
for the first part.

03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:33.201
‘She has’ is correct.

03:36:33.760 --> 03:36:34.480
What's missing?

03:36:35.359 --> 03:36:36.880
Don't forget the ‘been’.

03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:42.880
Also don't forget that we need to add ‘-ing’
to the verb.

03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:49.760
‘She has been thinking a lot, so she has
a headache.’

03:36:50.399 --> 03:36:52.799
Look at the next sentence and find the mistake.

03:36:54.080 --> 03:36:57.920
‘I'm so hungry because I have been diet.’

03:36:59.120 --> 03:37:05.680
The only mistake here is that someone forgot
to put the ‘-ing’ at the end of the verb, ‘diet’.

03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:10.400
The correct answer is,

03:37:10.399 --> 03:37:14.080
‘I'm so hungry because I have been dieting.’

03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:15.840
Great job, everyone.

03:37:16.399 --> 03:37:17.200
Let's move on.

03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:21.920
Thank you so much for watching this&nbsp;
grammar course on the present tense.&nbsp;

03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:26.640
Now, I want you to watch the next&nbsp;
grammar course on the past tense.&nbsp;

03:37:26.640 --> 03:37:29.840
I’ll see you there.

03:37:36.080 --> 03:37:37.359
Hi, everyone.

03:37:37.359 --> 03:37:41.679
In this video, I will introduce the past simple
English tense.

03:37:42.479 --> 03:37:48.879
This grammar tense can help you explain a
past general state, action, or habit.

03:37:49.439 --> 03:37:53.919
There's a lot to learn and it's a very important
tense, so keep watching.

03:37:57.680 --> 03:38:00.720
In this video, I will talk about the 'be'
verb

03:38:00.720 --> 03:38:02.320
in the past simple tense.

03:38:02.960 --> 03:38:08.640
The 'be' verb in the past simple tense can
be used to describe a past general state.

03:38:09.279 --> 03:38:13.599
We use the 'be' verbs, ‘was’ and ‘were’
in this tense.

03:38:14.239 --> 03:38:15.840
Take a look at the examples.

03:38:16.479 --> 03:38:17.839
‘I was scared.’

03:38:18.640 --> 03:38:21.680
‘James', or he 'was a teacher.’

03:38:22.720 --> 03:38:24.080
‘She was sad.’

03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:27.439
‘My dog was hungry.’

03:38:27.439 --> 03:38:28.879
‘My dog’ can be ‘it’.

03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:36.161
So for ‘I’, ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’,
we use the past tense 'be' verb, ‘was’.

03:38:37.199 --> 03:38:41.920
However, for ‘you’, ‘we’ and ‘they’,
we use ‘were’.

03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:44.560
‘You were a good student.’

03:38:45.359 --> 03:38:54.160
‘Your parents, or they were at the park.’
and ‘We were at home for two hours.’

03:38:54.160 --> 03:38:58.160
In this last sentence, you see that the duration
is emphasized.

03:38:58.720 --> 03:38:59.600
Great job.

03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:00.400
Let's move on.

03:39:01.439 --> 03:39:05.599
Now I will talk about regular verbs in the
past simple tense.

03:39:06.160 --> 03:39:07.840
Take a look at these examples.

03:39:08.800 --> 03:39:10.560
‘Liam played a game.’

03:39:11.439 --> 03:39:12.879
Liam is a ‘he’,

03:39:13.520 --> 03:39:18.320
but really it doesn't matter for regular verbs
in the past simple tense.

03:39:18.319 --> 03:39:24.719
Because no matter what the subject is, all
we have to do is add ‘d’ or ‘ed’

03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:26.080
to the end of the verb.

03:39:26.800 --> 03:39:30.239
Here the verb is ‘play’, so I added ‘-ed’.

03:39:30.880 --> 03:39:32.800
‘Liam played a game.’

03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:37.279
‘The car, or it needed gas.’

03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:39.920
The verb here is ‘need’.

03:39:39.920 --> 03:39:42.720
For the past simple tense, I added ‘-ed’.

03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:45.760
‘We watched a movie.’

03:39:46.319 --> 03:39:49.840
Again, an ‘ed’ at the of ‘watch’.

03:39:50.479 --> 03:39:52.879
‘You exercised for an hour.’

03:39:53.600 --> 03:39:56.240
In this case, the verb is ‘exercise’.

03:39:56.239 --> 03:40:00.000
I only need to add a ‘d’ to make it the
past tense.

03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:03.840
And finally, ‘They usually worked after
school.’

03:40:04.880 --> 03:40:06.400
The verb is ‘work’.

03:40:06.399 --> 03:40:09.920
And I added an ‘ed’
to make it in the past tense.

03:40:10.479 --> 03:40:14.639
The word ‘usually’ shows that this was
a habit.

03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:19.760
Remember, the past simple tense can be used
to show past habits.

03:40:20.479 --> 03:40:21.679
Let's move on.

03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:25.920
Now, I'll talk about irregular verbs in the
past simple tense.

03:40:26.479 --> 03:40:32.959
Remember, for regular verbs, we only add ‘d’
or ‘ed’ to make a verb into the past tense.

03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:38.480
However, for irregular verbs, we have to change
the verb in a different way.

03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:41.120
Let's take a look at some examples.

03:40:42.160 --> 03:40:43.920
‘I ate with my friend.’

03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:46.560
The verb here is ‘ate’.

03:40:47.279 --> 03:40:50.479
‘ate’ is the past simple tense of ‘eat’.

03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:55.041
The next example says, ‘Nara wrote a story.’

03:40:55.600 --> 03:40:57.600
The verb is ‘write’.

03:40:57.600 --> 03:41:03.920
And because it's irregular to change it into
the past tense, we change the verb to ‘wrote’.

03:41:05.199 --> 03:41:07.439
‘You often came home late.’

03:41:08.239 --> 03:41:12.719
The verb here is ‘come’ and it's been
changed to ‘came’.

03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:17.680
You'll notice that we had the word ‘often’
to show a habit.

03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:20.640
‘We bought a camera.’

03:41:21.439 --> 03:41:27.839
The verb here is ‘buy’ and it's been changed
to ‘bought’ to show the past simple tense.

03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:32.880
And finally, ‘My parents sent me money for
a year.’

03:41:33.600 --> 03:41:38.000
Here the verb ‘sent’ is the past tense
of ‘send’.

03:41:38.960 --> 03:41:43.520
Here we also see ‘for a year’, this shows
duration.

03:41:44.479 --> 03:41:45.679
Let's move on.

03:41:45.680 --> 03:41:51.520
Now I will talk about the negative form for
the 'be' verb in the past simple tense.

03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:52.960
Here are some examples.

03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:56.800
The first one says, ‘I was not hungry.’

03:41:57.840 --> 03:42:01.360
For the past simple tense, the negative 'be'
verb

03:42:01.359 --> 03:42:07.120
I f the subject is ‘I’, ‘he’, ‘she’
or ‘it’, we say ‘was not’.

03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:14.640
For example, ‘I was not’ or ‘she was
not’ or the contraction ‘wasn't’.

03:42:14.640 --> 03:42:16.161
‘I wasn't’.

03:42:16.160 --> 03:42:17.199
‘She wasn't’.

03:42:17.760 --> 03:42:21.280
So let's look again, ‘I was not hungry.’

03:42:22.399 --> 03:42:24.399
‘She wasn't home today.’

03:42:25.359 --> 03:42:29.439
Now, if the subject is ‘you’, ‘we’
or ‘they’,

03:42:29.439 --> 03:42:32.960
We say ‘were not’ or the contraction ‘weren't’.

03:42:33.760 --> 03:42:37.840
‘The children, or they were not quiet.’

03:42:38.640 --> 03:42:41.520
‘The children were not quiet.’

03:42:42.319 --> 03:42:48.559
And then, ‘The dog', or it was not, or 'wasn't
playful.’

03:42:49.439 --> 03:42:50.719
Let's move on.

03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:56.880
Now, let's talk about how to form the negative
in the past simple tense for non-'be' verbs,

03:42:56.880 --> 03:42:59.279
regular or irregular.

03:42:59.279 --> 03:43:00.719
Here are some examples.

03:43:01.359 --> 03:43:03.359
‘I did not like him.’

03:43:04.160 --> 03:43:10.239
What we do for non-'be' verbs is simply put
‘did not’ after the subject.

03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:15.520
And you'll notice that for the verb, we don't
make any changes.

03:43:15.520 --> 03:43:17.360
We keep the base verb.

03:43:18.479 --> 03:43:20.399
‘He didn't catch the ball.’

03:43:21.120 --> 03:43:26.319
Again, it's ‘he did not’,
but here we used a contraction,

03:43:26.319 --> 03:43:28.239
‘He didn't catch the ball.’

03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:31.680
‘They didn't dance.’

03:43:31.680 --> 03:43:34.560
Again, here's the contraction for ‘did not’.

03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:39.120
And you'll notice that for the verb, we didn't
change it at all.

03:43:39.760 --> 03:43:45.440
Here's an irregular verb, and here's a regular
verb, we keep them in the base form.

03:43:46.160 --> 03:43:49.760
And finally, ‘We didn't think about that.’

03:43:49.760 --> 03:43:53.360
Again, we simply say ‘did not’ or ‘didn't’.

03:43:54.080 --> 03:43:55.120
Let's move on.

03:43:55.120 --> 03:44:00.319
Now I will introduce two ways to form questions
for the past simple tense.

03:44:00.880 --> 03:44:02.720
Take a look at the first example.

03:44:03.520 --> 03:44:05.041
‘He was angry.’

03:44:05.920 --> 03:44:09.040
In this first sentence, we see the 'be' verb
‘was’.

03:44:09.840 --> 03:44:11.279
It's quite easy.

03:44:11.279 --> 03:44:16.719
All you have to do to turn this into a question
is switch the order the first two words.

03:44:17.279 --> 03:44:18.479
‘Was he angry?’

03:44:19.199 --> 03:44:24.239
You can answer by saying ‘Yes, he was.’
or ‘No, he wasn't.’

03:44:25.040 --> 03:44:28.239
The next sentence also has a 'be' verb.

03:44:28.239 --> 03:44:30.319
‘They were comfortable.’

03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:33.600
So again, switch the first two words.

03:44:34.239 --> 03:44:35.519
‘Were they comfortable?’

03:44:36.160 --> 03:44:39.120
The answers can be, ‘Yes, they were.’

03:44:39.120 --> 03:44:40.800
or ‘No, they weren't.’

03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:43.840
However, look at the third sentence.

03:44:44.399 --> 03:44:45.679
‘Sam lived here.’

03:44:46.319 --> 03:44:49.279
There is no 'be' verb in this sentence.

03:44:49.279 --> 03:44:52.239
Instead, we see the action verb ‘lived’.

03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:56.320
So what we do is no matter what the subject,

03:44:56.319 --> 03:44:58.239
we start the question with ‘did’.

03:44:59.120 --> 03:45:01.439
‘Did Sam live here?’

03:45:01.439 --> 03:45:06.160
You'll notice that the verb no longer is in
the past tense.

03:45:06.160 --> 03:45:08.399
We use the base form of the verb.

03:45:09.040 --> 03:45:10.880
‘Did Sam live here?’

03:45:11.520 --> 03:45:14.000
You can say ‘Yes, he did.’

03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:15.760
or ‘No, he didn't.’

03:45:16.640 --> 03:45:18.800
The last sentence is similar.

03:45:18.800 --> 03:45:21.120
‘They won the contest last year.’

03:45:21.840 --> 03:45:26.160
The verb here is ‘won’, that's not a 'be'
verb.

03:45:26.160 --> 03:45:29.519
So again, we start the question with ‘did’
.

03:45:29.520 --> 03:45:36.161
And then the subject ‘they’, we use the
base form of the verb and that's ‘win’.

03:45:36.880 --> 03:45:39.840
‘Did they win the contest last year?’

03:45:39.840 --> 03:45:42.000
You can say, ‘Yes, they did.’

03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:43.600
or ‘No, they didn't.’

03:45:44.319 --> 03:45:45.439
Let's move on.

03:45:45.439 --> 03:45:52.080
Now I'll introduce how to create an answer
WH questions in the past simple tense.

03:45:52.640 --> 03:45:54.320
Take a look at the board.

03:45:54.319 --> 03:45:56.559
We have some WH words here.

03:45:57.279 --> 03:45:58.479
‘What’
‘When’

03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:00.160
‘Where’
and ‘Why’

03:46:00.960 --> 03:46:05.199
You'll notice that after each WH word comes
the word ‘did’.

03:46:05.840 --> 03:46:08.160
‘What did’
‘When did’

03:46:08.160 --> 03:46:10.160
‘Where did’
and ‘Why did’.

03:46:11.040 --> 03:46:16.720
What comes after that the subject and then
the base form of the verb.

03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:18.320
So, let's take a look.

03:46:19.120 --> 03:46:21.840
‘What did you do last night?’

03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:24.000
‘What did you do last night?’

03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:28.960
I can answer by saying something like, ‘I
watched a movie.’

03:46:28.960 --> 03:46:30.480
Or ‘I read a book.’

03:46:31.199 --> 03:46:36.080
You'll notice that the answer is in the past
simple tense.

03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:37.840
‘When did you get home last night?’

03:46:38.560 --> 03:46:40.560
‘I got home at 10 p.m.’

03:46:42.080 --> 03:46:44.160
‘Where did they eat lunch?’

03:46:44.160 --> 03:46:46.000
‘They ate lunch at home.’

03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:50.161
Again, ‘ate’ is the past tense of ‘eat’.

03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:52.319
Answer in the past simple tense.

03:46:52.880 --> 03:46:56.080
And finally, ‘Why did the company hire him?’

03:46:56.880 --> 03:47:00.560
‘The company hired him because he's a hard
worker.’

03:47:01.439 --> 03:47:02.239
Let's move on.

03:47:02.800 --> 03:47:05.440
In this first checkup, we'll take a look at

03:47:05.439 --> 03:47:09.439
practice questions
using the 'be' verb in the past simple tense.

03:47:10.160 --> 03:47:15.120
Remember the 'be' verbs in the past simple
tense are ‘was’ or ‘were’.

03:47:15.680 --> 03:47:18.240
Let's take a look at the first sentence.

03:47:18.239 --> 03:47:20.559
‘He __ at work earlier.’

03:47:21.199 --> 03:47:22.720
The subject here is ‘we’.

03:47:23.359 --> 03:47:26.319
So do we use ‘was’ or ‘were’?

03:47:26.319 --> 03:47:28.639
The correct answer is ‘was’.

03:47:29.439 --> 03:47:32.239
‘He was at work earlier.’

03:47:32.880 --> 03:47:34.400
The next sentence says,

03:47:34.399 --> 03:47:37.439
‘We _____ very happy yesterday.’

03:47:38.080 --> 03:47:42.479
If the subject is ‘we’, remember the be
verb is ‘were’.

03:47:44.880 --> 03:47:47.520
‘We were very happy yesterday.’

03:47:48.399 --> 03:47:53.439
Next, ‘My parents or they __ worried about
me.’

03:47:54.479 --> 03:47:58.319
If it's 'they', remember we have to say ‘were’.

03:47:59.279 --> 03:48:01.519
‘My parents were worried about me.’

03:48:02.239 --> 03:48:07.760
If I want to use the negative, I can also
say ‘My parents weren't worried about me.’

03:48:07.760 --> 03:48:08.800
And that's possible.

03:48:09.600 --> 03:48:13.840
Now I want you to find the mistake in the
next sentence.

03:48:14.720 --> 03:48:16.720
‘We wasn't good students.’

03:48:17.680 --> 03:48:19.520
We wasn't good students.

03:48:20.160 --> 03:48:21.760
Can you figure out what's wrong?

03:48:22.640 --> 03:48:27.200
The subject here is ‘we’, so we don't
say ‘was not’.

03:48:27.199 --> 03:48:31.359
We need to say ‘were not’ or the contraction
‘weren't’.

03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:38.640
‘We weren't good students,’ is the correct
answer.

03:48:39.279 --> 03:48:41.840
The next one says, ‘Were she a teacher?’

03:48:42.960 --> 03:48:47.120
Now, this is a question so the be verb comes
at the beginning.

03:48:47.120 --> 03:48:50.559
That's correct, but the subject here is ‘she’.

03:48:51.359 --> 03:48:54.719
Therefore, we need to start with ‘was’.

03:48:55.439 --> 03:48:56.799
‘Was she a teacher?’

03:48:57.920 --> 03:48:58.720
And finally,

03:48:59.279 --> 03:49:01.120
‘They wasn't at school.’

03:49:02.080 --> 03:49:10.080
The subject is ‘they’, so the answer is

03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:12.640
‘They weren't at school.’

03:49:12.640 --> 03:49:16.240
You can use the contraction ‘weren't’
or ‘were not’.

03:49:16.960 --> 03:49:18.720
Let's move on to the next checkup.

03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:24.720
Now, let's practice regular verbs in the past
simple tense.

03:49:24.720 --> 03:49:26.480
Take a look at the first sentence.

03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:28.720
‘He ____ at home.’

03:49:29.359 --> 03:49:31.040
The verb is ‘study’.

03:49:31.840 --> 03:49:34.800
Remember, when changing a regular verb into

03:49:34.800 --> 03:49:39.040
the past tense,
we add ‘d’ or ‘ed’ to the end of the

03:49:39.040 --> 03:49:39.359
verb.

03:49:39.920 --> 03:49:44.319
However, there's a separate rule for words
that end in ‘y’.

03:49:44.319 --> 03:49:45.599
Such as, ‘study’.

03:49:46.160 --> 03:49:49.359
We drop the ‘y’ and we add ‘ied’.

03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:52.080
So the correct answer is,

03:49:52.080 --> 03:49:56.080
‘He studied at home.’

03:49:57.040 --> 03:50:00.399
The next sentence says, ‘We __ pencils.’

03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:04.720
We want to use negative because it says ‘not
use’.

03:50:05.520 --> 03:50:11.440
Remember for the negative, we always use ‘did
not’, no matter what the subject.

03:50:15.040 --> 03:50:17.519
You can also use the contraction ‘didn't’.

03:50:18.319 --> 03:50:20.719
Now, what do we do to the verb?

03:50:20.720 --> 03:50:22.640
We keep it as ‘is’.

03:50:22.640 --> 03:50:24.080
We do not change it.

03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:28.960
‘We didn't’ or ‘We did not’ use pencils.

03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:35.600
The next sentence says, ‘His friends or
they walk to the gym.’

03:50:36.479 --> 03:50:38.479
What's the past tense of ‘walk’?

03:50:39.040 --> 03:50:43.359
We simply have to add ‘ed’ because it's
a regular verb.

03:50:47.439 --> 03:50:49.599
‘His friends walked to the gym.’

03:50:50.640 --> 03:50:53.440
Now, find a mistake in the next sentence.

03:50:56.239 --> 03:50:58.479
‘She didn't likes math.’

03:50:59.520 --> 03:51:01.200
‘didn't’ is correct.

03:51:01.760 --> 03:51:07.040
However, remember we keep the verb as ‘is’
in the base form.

03:51:07.040 --> 03:51:09.279
So we don't say ‘likes’.

03:51:09.279 --> 03:51:10.719
We say ‘like’.

03:51:11.439 --> 03:51:12.960
‘She didn't like math.’

03:51:13.840 --> 03:51:17.279
The next sentence says, ‘Did it rained this
morning?’

03:51:17.840 --> 03:51:19.279
Now this is a question.

03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:23.359
In a question, it’s right to start the sentence
with ‘Did’.

03:51:24.319 --> 03:51:25.279
‘Did it rained?’

03:51:26.160 --> 03:51:27.439
Do you notice the mistake?

03:51:28.319 --> 03:51:34.000
Remember, we do not use the past tense form
in the question.

03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:36.640
We use the base form of the verb.

03:51:36.640 --> 03:51:38.161
‘Did it rain this morning?’

03:51:39.040 --> 03:51:42.479
And finally, ‘They not play the piano.’

03:51:43.279 --> 03:51:45.599
The verb is an action verb.

03:51:45.600 --> 03:51:48.640
So we need a ‘did’ in front of ‘not’.

03:51:50.560 --> 03:51:53.200
‘They did not play the piano.’

03:51:54.080 --> 03:51:55.920
Let's move on to the next checkup.

03:51:56.640 --> 03:52:01.280
Now, I'll talk about irregular verbs in the
past simple tense.

03:52:01.279 --> 03:52:03.120
Take a look at the first sentence.

03:52:03.680 --> 03:52:05.360
‘He __ to school.’

03:52:06.000 --> 03:52:07.359
And the verb is ‘run’.

03:52:08.239 --> 03:52:13.199
‘run’ is an irregular verb, so the past
tense form is ‘ran’.

03:52:15.199 --> 03:52:16.960
‘He ran to school.’

03:52:18.080 --> 03:52:21.279
The next sentence says, ‘We __ flowers.’

03:52:21.840 --> 03:52:25.840
We want to use the negative because here it
says ‘not grow’.

03:52:26.479 --> 03:52:30.719
Remember, no matter what the subject in the
negative form,

03:52:30.720 --> 03:52:32.240
we say ‘did not’

03:52:35.680 --> 03:52:36.960
or ‘didn't’.

03:52:37.920 --> 03:52:41.040
Then we keep the verb in its base form.

03:52:44.239 --> 03:52:48.399
‘We did not grow’ or ‘We didn't grow
flowers.’

03:52:49.279 --> 03:52:54.319
The next sentence says, ‘Where __ you teach
last year?’

03:52:54.319 --> 03:52:55.679
This is a question.

03:52:56.399 --> 03:53:00.399
Again, all we need to put is ‘did’.

03:53:01.199 --> 03:53:03.679
‘Where did you teach last year?’

03:53:03.680 --> 03:53:06.160
It doesn't matter what the subject is.

03:53:06.160 --> 03:53:08.000
We always go with ‘did’.

03:53:09.040 --> 03:53:12.319
Next, try to find the mistake in the next
sentence.

03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:15.120
‘He didn't sold newspapers.’

03:53:16.399 --> 03:53:22.239
Remember, in the negative, ‘didn't’ is
correct for whatever subject there is.

03:53:22.960 --> 03:53:26.480
However, we need to keep the verb in its base
form.

03:53:27.439 --> 03:53:32.080
So the correct answer is, ‘He didn't sell
newspapers.’

03:53:32.960 --> 03:53:36.560
The next sentence says, ‘Did she sing a
song?’

03:53:37.279 --> 03:53:39.840
You'll notice it's a similar problem here.

03:53:40.640 --> 03:53:44.080
‘sang’ is the irregular past tense form
of ‘sing’.

03:53:44.720 --> 03:53:48.400
But in a question, if it starts with ‘did’,

03:53:48.399 --> 03:53:49.839
we use the base form.

03:53:50.640 --> 03:53:53.600
‘Did she sing a song?’

03:53:54.720 --> 03:53:57.520
And finally, ‘We taked it home.’

03:53:58.479 --> 03:53:59.679
Does that sound right?

03:54:00.640 --> 03:54:02.560
‘taked’ is not correct.

03:54:03.120 --> 03:54:07.120
The past tense of ‘take’ is ‘took’.

03:54:08.160 --> 03:54:09.840
‘We took it home.’

03:54:10.720 --> 03:54:12.080
Great job, everyone.

03:54:12.080 --> 03:54:13.199
Let's move on.

03:54:13.199 --> 03:54:16.080
Wow, we learned a lot in this video.

03:54:16.720 --> 03:54:20.320
Keep studying and reviewing the past simple
tense.

03:54:20.319 --> 03:54:24.239
It's an essential tense that will help you
talk about the past.

03:54:24.880 --> 03:54:28.239
Keep studying English and I'll see you in
the next video.

03:54:28.239 --> 03:54:31.840
Bye.&nbsp;

03:54:37.680 --> 03:54:38.800
Hi, everybody.

03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:40.080
I'm Esther.

03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:41.199
In this video.

03:54:41.199 --> 03:54:44.000
I will introduce the past continuous
tense.

03:54:44.720 --> 03:54:49.760
This tense can be used to describe an action
that was ongoing in the past.

03:54:50.319 --> 03:54:55.920
It can also be used to describe two actions
happening at the same time in the past.

03:54:56.560 --> 03:54:59.840
There's a lot to learn so let's get started.

03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:06.880
Let's take a look at the first usage of the
past continuous tense.

03:55:07.680 --> 03:55:12.720
This tense can be used to describe an action
that was ongoing in the past.

03:55:13.279 --> 03:55:15.199
Let's take a look at these examples.

03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:18.960
‘I was walking in the park in the evening.’

03:55:19.920 --> 03:55:22.640
So first we start with the subject, ‘I’.

03:55:23.600 --> 03:55:28.240
For I, he, she, and it, we follow with ‘was’.

03:55:28.960 --> 03:55:29.760
‘I was’

03:55:30.479 --> 03:55:34.319
And then we add an ‘ING’ to the end of
the verb.

03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:36.480
‘I was walking’

03:55:37.279 --> 03:55:39.199
Now take a look at the whole sentence.

03:55:39.840 --> 03:55:42.640
‘I was walking in the park in the evening.’

03:55:43.359 --> 03:55:48.960
You can see that this was an ongoing action
and it happened in the past.

03:55:50.080 --> 03:55:51.840
Let's look at the next example.

03:55:52.720 --> 03:55:56.160
‘She was living here last year.’

03:55:56.160 --> 03:55:58.080
Here, the subject is ‘she’.

03:55:58.080 --> 03:56:01.840
So again we use ‘was’ and then ‘verb-ing’.

03:56:02.800 --> 03:56:09.840
Here we have another expression that shows
that this action was happening in the past.

03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:15.120
‘The dog,’ or ‘it’, ‘was eating
dinner five minutes ago.’

03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:21.359
The subject here is ‘the dog’ which can
be replaced by the pronoun ‘it’.

03:56:21.359 --> 03:56:23.839
And so we follow with ‘was’.

03:56:24.479 --> 03:56:29.839
And finally, ‘Andy and Jim,’ we can replace
this with ‘they’.

03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:34.960
For ‘you’, ‘we’ and ‘they’, we
use ‘were’.

03:56:35.760 --> 03:56:40.880
‘They were’, or ‘Andy and Jim were working
at 9:00 p.m.’

03:56:42.080 --> 03:56:42.800
Let's move on.

03:56:43.359 --> 03:56:47.920
The past continuous tense is also used to
describe an ongoing

03:56:47.920 --> 03:56:51.840
action in the past that was interrupted by
another action.

03:56:52.640 --> 03:56:57.920
This interrupting action is used in the past
simple tense with the word ‘when’.

03:56:58.720 --> 03:57:00.400
Let's take a look at this example.

03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:03.599
‘I was playing cards when you called.’

03:57:04.479 --> 03:57:08.639
Again we start with the subject ‘was’
or ‘were’,

03:57:08.640 --> 03:57:10.240
and then ‘verb-ing’,

03:57:11.199 --> 03:57:15.439
so this is the action that was ongoing in
the past,

03:57:15.439 --> 03:57:16.799
‘I was playing cards’

03:57:17.439 --> 03:57:21.599
The interrupting action in this sentence is
‘you called’.

03:57:22.239 --> 03:57:27.040
You'll notice I use the word ‘when’ to
show the interrupting action’

03:57:27.040 --> 03:57:30.640
And I used it in the past simple tense, ‘called’.

03:57:32.080 --> 03:57:33.840
Let's take a look at the next sentence.

03:57:34.479 --> 03:57:38.959
‘The cat' or 'it' was eating when Eric came
home.’

03:57:39.920 --> 03:57:44.480
Again the action in progress is ‘the cat
was eating’.

03:57:45.199 --> 03:57:50.000
And ‘Eric came home’, you'll notice the
past simple tense.

03:57:50.000 --> 03:57:53.840
This is the interrupting action used with
the word ‘when’.

03:57:55.279 --> 03:57:57.759
‘We were sleeping when Anne arrived.’

03:57:58.479 --> 03:58:01.839
Again we have the ongoing action in the past.

03:58:02.560 --> 03:58:04.161
The subject here is ‘we’.

03:58:04.160 --> 03:58:08.639
And so we used ‘were’ and then ‘verb-ing’.

03:58:09.760 --> 03:58:12.960
‘When Anne arrived’ is the interrupting
action.

03:58:13.840 --> 03:58:20.400
And finally, ‘Alicia and I’, or ‘We'
were walking when we saw Mark.’

03:58:21.439 --> 03:58:27.120
‘When we saw Mark’ is the interrupting
action that interrupted the ongoing ‘Alicia

03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:28.559
and I were walking’.

03:58:29.359 --> 03:58:35.279
It's also important to note that we can also
switch the order of the sentence around and

03:58:35.279 --> 03:58:35.840
say,

03:58:35.840 --> 03:58:38.960
‘When you called, I was playing cards,’

03:58:38.960 --> 03:58:42.560
or ‘When Eric came home, the cat was eating.’

03:58:43.520 --> 03:58:44.320
Let's move on.

03:58:45.199 --> 03:58:50.720
Another usage for the past continuous tense
is to talk about two actions that were

03:58:50.720 --> 03:58:53.199
happening at the same time in the past.

03:58:53.920 --> 03:58:58.880
We use the past continuous tense for both
actions with the word ‘while’.

03:58:59.760 --> 03:59:01.680
Let's take a look at some examples.

03:59:02.560 --> 03:59:07.520
The first sentence says,
‘While I was playing soccer, she was watching

03:59:07.520 --> 03:59:07.680
me.’

03:59:08.399 --> 03:59:12.879
You'll notice that both actions are in the
past continuous tense.

03:59:13.439 --> 03:59:16.799
‘I was playing soccer’ and ‘She was
watching me’.

03:59:17.520 --> 03:59:23.200
The word ‘while’ at the beginning shows
that these actions were happening at the sametime.

03:59:24.800 --> 03:59:28.000
‘While you were reading, I was preparing
dinner.’

03:59:28.800 --> 03:59:33.360
Again both actions are expressed in the past
continuous tense.

03:59:34.080 --> 03:59:38.000
The word ‘while’ shows that they were
happening at the same time.

03:59:39.600 --> 03:59:43.040
‘While Her husband’ or ‘he’, ‘was
driving

03:59:43.680 --> 03:59:45.520
she was taking pictures.’

03:59:46.479 --> 03:59:49.679
Both actions are in the past continuous tense.

03:59:50.399 --> 03:59:51.120
And finally,

03:59:51.760 --> 03:59:55.040
‘While we were eating, the music was playing.’

03:59:56.000 --> 03:59:58.800
Both actions were happening at the same time.

03:59:59.840 --> 04:00:05.440
Now, you'll notice that in my examples the
word ‘while’ comes at the beginning,

04:00:06.080 --> 04:00:11.199
however, it's important to note that you can
move the word ‘while’ around in several

04:00:11.199 --> 04:00:11.599
ways.

04:00:12.239 --> 04:00:15.120
For example, instead of saying this,

04:00:15.120 --> 04:00:18.479
‘While I was playing soccer, she was watching
me.’

04:00:18.479 --> 04:00:21.120
I can move ‘while’ to the middle of the
sentence.

04:00:21.760 --> 04:00:24.880
‘I was playing soccer while she was watching
me.’

04:00:25.600 --> 04:00:28.240
I can put the ‘while’ between the two
actions.

04:00:29.040 --> 04:00:32.720
Or I can also change the sentence around and
say,

04:00:32.720 --> 04:00:35.840
‘While she was watching me, I was playing
soccer.’

04:00:36.479 --> 04:00:41.519
So it doesn't matter which action comes first
with the ‘while’ if you put it in the

04:00:41.520 --> 04:00:42.000
beginning.

04:00:42.960 --> 04:00:43.760
Let's move on.

04:00:44.319 --> 04:00:49.519
Now let's talk about the negative form of
the past continuous tense.

04:00:49.520 --> 04:00:50.960
Here are some examples.

04:00:51.520 --> 04:00:53.840
‘She was not reading last night.’

04:00:54.560 --> 04:00:57.920
The subject is ‘she’ and so we use ‘was’.

04:00:58.800 --> 04:01:02.880
However, before the ‘verb-ing’, we add
‘not’.

04:01:03.439 --> 04:01:05.839
‘She was not reading last night.’

04:01:06.479 --> 04:01:09.040
I can use a contraction and say,

04:01:09.040 --> 04:01:11.359
‘She wasn't reading last night.’

04:01:12.720 --> 04:01:27.600
‘We were not listening to music this morning.’

04:01:27.600 --> 04:01:27.848
In this case, the subject is ‘we’ and
so we use ‘were’.

04:01:27.847 --> 04:01:28.039
Again ‘not’ comes before the ‘verb-ing’.

04:01:28.039 --> 04:01:28.239
‘We were not listening to music this morning.’

04:01:28.239 --> 04:01:31.120
Again I can use a contraction and say,

04:01:31.120 --> 04:01:33.760
‘We weren't listening to music this morning.’

04:01:34.720 --> 04:01:39.760
And the next one says,
‘He wasn't watching TV when his dad came

04:01:39.760 --> 04:01:40.000
home.’

04:01:40.960 --> 04:01:44.800
In this example, the contraction is already
there for you,

04:01:44.800 --> 04:01:46.400
‘He wasn't watching TV’.

04:01:47.279 --> 04:01:48.960
You'll notice the word ‘when’.

04:01:49.920 --> 04:01:55.760
Remember ‘when’ + ‘a past simple tense
verb’ shows an interrupting action,

04:01:56.319 --> 04:02:00.239
so, ‘When his dad came home he wasn't watching
TV.’

04:02:00.880 --> 04:02:02.160
He was doing something else.

04:02:03.040 --> 04:02:04.239
And finally,

04:02:04.239 --> 04:02:07.199
‘They weren't talking while the game was
playing.’

04:02:08.000 --> 04:02:10.880
The word ‘while’ is in this sentence.

04:02:10.880 --> 04:02:17.279
Remember that shows 2 past ongoing actions
happening at the same time,

04:02:17.279 --> 04:02:21.040
so ‘While the game was playing they weren't
talking’.

04:02:21.040 --> 04:02:22.319
They were doing something else.

04:02:23.120 --> 04:02:25.120
Let's move on now.

04:02:25.120 --> 04:02:30.080
Let's talk about how to form ‘be’ verb
questions for the past continuous tense.

04:02:30.720 --> 04:02:32.880
Take a look at the first statement.

04:02:32.880 --> 04:02:34.000
It says,

04:02:34.000 --> 04:02:35.600
‘It was raining this morning.’

04:02:36.399 --> 04:02:40.000
In order to turn this into a question, it's
quite easy,

04:02:40.560 --> 04:02:44.240
all we have to do is change the order of the
first two words.

04:02:44.800 --> 04:02:49.760
Instead of ‘It was’, I now say ‘Was
it’ to make it a question.

04:02:50.399 --> 04:02:54.160
You'll notice that the rest of the words stay
in the same place.

04:02:54.960 --> 04:02:56.560
‘Was it raining this morning?’

04:02:57.359 --> 04:03:01.920
You can answer by saying,
‘Yes, it was.’ or ‘No, it wasn't.’

04:03:02.960 --> 04:03:04.640
The next statement says,

04:03:04.640 --> 04:03:07.280
‘They were living there when the fire happened.’

04:03:07.920 --> 04:03:14.000
To turn this into a big question, again we
just switched the order of the first two words.

04:03:14.560 --> 04:03:17.440
Instead of ‘They were’, we say ‘Were
they’.

04:03:18.239 --> 04:03:21.920
And again, the rest of the words can stay
in the same place.

04:03:22.720 --> 04:03:25.280
‘Were they living there when the fire happened?’

04:03:26.000 --> 04:03:27.600
And you can answer by saying,

04:03:27.600 --> 04:03:30.400
‘Yes, they were’ or ‘No, they weren't.’

04:03:31.040 --> 04:03:32.080
Let's continue on.

04:03:33.120 --> 04:03:38.720
Now I'll go into how to make WH questions
for the past continuous tense.

04:03:39.279 --> 04:03:44.559
You'll notice that the examples here all begin
with some WH words.

04:03:44.560 --> 04:03:49.280
For example,
‘what’, ‘where’, ‘why’, and ‘who’.

04:03:50.080 --> 04:03:51.840
Let's take a look at the first question.

04:03:52.800 --> 04:03:54.720
‘What were they doing last night?”

04:03:55.600 --> 04:03:58.240
The subject of this sentence is ‘they’.

04:03:59.199 --> 04:04:04.720
So what you do is after the WH word you put
the proper ‘be’ verb.

04:04:04.720 --> 04:04:06.080
In this case, ‘were’.

04:04:06.960 --> 04:04:08.880
‘What were they doing last night?’

04:04:09.520 --> 04:04:13.200
You'll notice that after the subject comes
the ‘verb-ing’.

04:04:14.160 --> 04:04:16.000
‘What were they doing last night?’

04:04:16.720 --> 04:04:20.800
I can answer by saying,
‘They were playing games’ or

04:04:20.800 --> 04:04:22.080
‘They were reading a book’.

04:04:23.120 --> 04:04:24.399
The next question says,

04:04:25.040 --> 04:04:36.560
‘Where was he working last week?’

04:04:45.920 --> 04:04:49.024
In this case the subject is ‘he’ and so
the be verb to use is ‘was’.

04:04:49.024 --> 04:04:49.061
‘Where was he working last week?’

04:04:49.061 --> 04:04:49.103
I can say, ‘He was working in Canada.’

04:04:49.103 --> 04:04:49.154
‘Why was she crying when she finished the
book?’

04:04:49.154 --> 04:04:51.439
In this case, the subject is ‘she’ and
so I put ‘was’ after ‘why’.

04:04:52.479 --> 04:04:55.199
‘Why was she crying when she finished the
book?’

04:04:55.920 --> 04:05:00.319
I can say, ‘She was crying because the ending
was sad.’

04:05:01.199 --> 04:05:01.840
And finally,

04:05:02.479 --> 04:05:06.639
‘Who were the children staying with while
their mom was working?’

04:05:07.359 --> 04:05:11.199
In this case, ‘the children’ is a ‘they’

04:05:11.199 --> 04:05:13.519
so we follow 'who' with ‘were’.

04:05:14.160 --> 04:05:16.399
‘Who were they’ or

04:05:16.399 --> 04:05:20.639
‘Who were the children staying with while
their mom was working?’

04:05:21.520 --> 04:05:24.720
To answer, I can say, ‘The children’ or

04:05:24.720 --> 04:05:27.040
‘They were staying with their dad.’

04:05:27.840 --> 04:05:28.640
Let's move on.

04:05:29.199 --> 04:05:33.519
In this section, let's do a checkup for the
past continuous tense.

04:05:34.399 --> 04:05:36.239
Take a look at the first sentence.

04:05:37.120 --> 04:05:40.080
‘Last night they were blank at school.’

04:05:40.960 --> 04:05:45.680
I want you to try to fill in the blank with
the negative for the verb ‘stay’.

04:05:46.239 --> 04:05:46.960
‘not stay’

04:05:47.760 --> 04:05:48.880
What do you think it is?

04:05:50.000 --> 04:05:53.279
Remember, for the negative of the past continuous,

04:05:53.840 --> 04:05:59.760
all you have to do is put ‘not’ and then
‘verb-ing’ after the 'be' verb.

04:06:00.479 --> 04:06:09.799
‘They were not staying at school last.’

04:06:09.800 --> 04:06:12.480
‘Last night, they were not staying at school.’

04:06:13.600 --> 04:06:14.800
The next sentence says,

04:06:15.439 --> 04:06:18.639
‘Two days ago you blank soccer.’

04:06:19.359 --> 04:06:22.559
Again try the negative for the verb ‘play’.

04:06:23.840 --> 04:06:27.840
‘Two days ago blank not play soccer.’

04:06:28.640 --> 04:06:32.480
In this case, the first thing that's missing
is the ‘be’ verb.

04:06:33.120 --> 04:06:38.479
If the subject is ‘you’, can you think
of which be verb needs to be put in there?

04:06:39.359 --> 04:06:41.519
The correct answer is ‘were’.

04:06:42.560 --> 04:06:44.800
And then, we say ‘not’.

04:06:45.920 --> 04:06:47.199
What happens after that?

04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:50.079
Remember, ‘verb-ing’.

04:06:51.040 --> 04:06:54.479
So ‘you were not playing’

04:06:55.359 --> 04:06:58.479
‘two days ago, you were not playing soccer’

04:06:59.040 --> 04:07:01.359
You can also use a contraction and say,

04:07:01.359 --> 04:07:03.199
‘You weren't playing soccer.’

04:07:04.080 --> 04:07:08.000
Now try to find the mistake in the next sentence.

04:07:08.000 --> 04:07:10.720
‘Yesterday, she were reading at home.’

04:07:11.800 --> 04:07:12.800
hmmm

04:07:12.800 --> 04:07:19.840
The subject of this sentence is ‘she’
so the ‘be’ verb to use is not ‘were’.

04:07:19.840 --> 04:07:21.840
It's 'was'.

04:07:22.399 --> 04:07:25.279
‘Yesterday, she was reading at home.’

04:07:26.399 --> 04:07:31.279
In the next sentence it says, ‘Tomorrow,
they were seeing their friends.’

04:07:32.600 --> 04:07:33.600
hmmm

04:07:33.600 --> 04:07:35.200
‘They’ and ‘were’

04:07:35.199 --> 04:07:35.840
That's correct.

04:07:36.399 --> 04:07:38.559
And we have the ‘verb-ing’

04:07:39.279 --> 04:07:40.479
So what's the mistake?

04:07:41.279 --> 04:07:44.800
Remember the past continuous is for the past.

04:07:45.359 --> 04:07:48.159
‘Tomorrow’ is not the past.

04:07:48.159 --> 04:07:52.800
So instead, we need to put a word that shows
the past.

04:07:52.800 --> 04:07:55.920
For example, I can say, ‘yesterday’.

04:07:58.080 --> 04:08:00.559
‘Yesterday, they were seeing their friends.’

04:08:01.520 --> 04:08:02.320
Let's move on.

04:08:02.960 --> 04:08:06.319
Now, let's start a checkup of the ‘when’
usage

04:08:06.319 --> 04:08:08.159
of the past continuous tense.

04:08:08.720 --> 04:08:10.480
Take a look at the first example.

04:08:11.120 --> 04:08:16.159
It says, ‘Andrea and John’ blank when
they bank hurt.’

04:08:17.040 --> 04:08:21.120
Remember ‘when’ shows an interrupting
action.

04:08:21.120 --> 04:08:24.479
It needs to be used with the past simple tense.

04:08:24.479 --> 04:08:27.359
So let's first look at the second blank.

04:08:27.359 --> 04:08:29.120
‘When they blank hurt’

04:08:29.840 --> 04:08:32.159
What's the past tense of the verb ‘get’?

04:08:32.800 --> 04:08:34.960
The answer is ‘got’.

04:08:36.319 --> 04:08:41.040
Now let's take a look at the action that was
in progress in the past.

04:08:41.680 --> 04:08:44.000
‘Andrea and John’ or ‘they’

04:08:44.880 --> 04:08:46.480
Well what comes after ‘they’?

04:08:47.520 --> 04:08:48.000
‘were’.

04:08:48.960 --> 04:08:50.800
‘Andrea and John were’

04:08:51.600 --> 04:08:54.960
Then remember we need to add -ing to the verb.

04:08:56.239 --> 04:09:03.040
‘They were skiing’ or ‘Andrea and John
were skiing when they got hurt’.

04:09:04.000 --> 04:09:09.199
The next example says, ‘It blank not raining
when the game blank’.

04:09:09.760 --> 04:09:13.440
And I want you to use the verb ‘start’
for the second blank.

04:09:14.479 --> 04:09:19.199
Take a look ‘when the game blank’ what's
the past tense of ‘start’?

04:09:20.960 --> 04:09:21.600
‘started’

04:09:22.800 --> 04:09:26.239
Now let's look at the first part of the sentence.

04:09:26.239 --> 04:09:27.840
The subject is ‘it’.

04:09:28.960 --> 04:09:31.760
So what ‘be’ verb do we use for 'it'?

04:09:33.520 --> 04:09:33.840
‘was’

04:09:34.640 --> 04:09:37.360
‘It was not raining when the game started.’

04:09:38.159 --> 04:09:41.840
Now find the mistake in the next sentence.

04:09:44.000 --> 04:09:48.000
‘I wasn't study at the library yesterday’.

04:09:48.720 --> 04:09:53.840
The subject here is ‘I’ and so the ‘be’
verb ‘was’ is correct.

04:09:54.560 --> 04:09:59.200
Here there's a contraction, ‘I wasn't’
for ‘I was not’.

04:10:00.159 --> 04:10:02.399
Now the problem is with the verb.

04:10:02.960 --> 04:10:08.159
Remember we need to put ‘–ing’ at the
end of the verb.

04:10:08.159 --> 04:10:11.599
‘I wasn't studying at the library yesterday.’

04:10:12.319 --> 04:10:17.120
And finally,
‘We did meet our friends last weekend.’

04:10:18.159 --> 04:10:24.000
That sounds right, but remember we're doing
the past continuous tense.

04:10:24.000 --> 04:10:24.960
Take a look again.

04:10:25.600 --> 04:10:27.121
The subject is ‘we’.

04:10:27.920 --> 04:10:29.120
We need a ‘be’ verb.

04:10:29.840 --> 04:10:30.319
‘were’

04:10:32.080 --> 04:10:33.040
Then what happens?

04:10:33.760 --> 04:10:38.640
Remember, we need to add an ‘-ing’ to
the end of the verb,

04:10:39.199 --> 04:10:44.239
so we take out ‘did’ and say,
‘We were meeting our friends last weekend.’

04:10:45.040 --> 04:10:46.159
Let's move on.

04:10:46.159 --> 04:10:51.840
Now, for this checkup, we'll look at the ‘while’
usage of the past continuous tense.

04:10:52.479 --> 04:10:54.239
Take a look at the first example.

04:10:54.800 --> 04:10:58.159
‘While I blank someone blank my bike.’

04:10:58.960 --> 04:11:02.640
When we use ‘while’ in the past continuous
tense,

04:11:02.640 --> 04:11:07.280
we're showing that two actions happened at
the same time in the past

04:11:07.279 --> 04:11:10.880
or they were happening at the same time in
the past.

04:11:10.880 --> 04:11:15.359
So we need to use the past continuous for
both actions.

04:11:16.479 --> 04:11:18.239
‘While I blank’

04:11:18.800 --> 04:11:21.600
I want you to use ‘shop’ in the first
blank.

04:11:22.239 --> 04:11:27.679
Remember, the subject here is ‘I’ so I
need to use the ‘be’ verb ‘was’.

04:11:29.600 --> 04:11:33.680
Then ‘verb-ing’.

04:11:35.760 --> 04:11:37.199
‘While I was shopping’

04:11:38.239 --> 04:11:41.199
Now ‘someone’ can be a ‘he’ or ‘she’.

04:11:41.840 --> 04:11:44.400
Therefore, again we need to use ‘was’

04:11:46.399 --> 04:11:50.080
and then the ‘verb-ing’ of ‘steal’.

04:11:51.120 --> 04:11:54.720
‘While I was shopping, someone was stealing
my bike.’

04:11:55.760 --> 04:11:57.120
The next sentence says,

04:11:57.680 --> 04:11:59.120
‘While he blank’

04:11:59.920 --> 04:12:02.080
I want you to use the verb ‘cook’.

04:12:03.040 --> 04:12:08.640
The subject is ‘he’ and so I need to use
‘was cooking’.

04:12:10.720 --> 04:12:18.960
‘While he was cooking, his girlfriend was
cleaning.’

04:12:20.080 --> 04:12:20.880
Did you get that?

04:12:22.080 --> 04:12:22.880
Let's move on.

04:12:23.439 --> 04:12:26.080
Try to find the mistake in the next sentence.

04:12:29.199 --> 04:12:33.519
‘Jane was looking for us while we get off
the plane.’

04:12:34.720 --> 04:12:37.199
The first part of the sentence is correct.

04:12:37.760 --> 04:12:39.120
‘Jane was looking’

04:12:40.319 --> 04:12:43.120
Now the second part of the sentence.

04:12:43.120 --> 04:12:46.159
Notice it's not in the past continuous tense.

04:12:46.800 --> 04:12:49.279
‘While we get off the plane’

04:12:49.279 --> 04:12:54.319
So what we need to do is say, ‘were getting’.

04:12:56.640 --> 04:13:00.800
‘Jane was looking for us while we were getting
off the plane.’

04:13:02.000 --> 04:13:07.520
The next sentence says, 'I was watching TV
while my wife sleep’

04:13:08.800 --> 04:13:13.760
Again this part of the sentence did not use
the past continuous tense.

04:13:14.560 --> 04:13:22.720
My wife is a ‘she’ and so I need to say
‘was sleeping’.

04:13:23.279 --> 04:13:26.639
‘I was watching TV while my wife was sleeping.’

04:13:27.520 --> 04:13:28.800
Great job, everyone.

04:13:28.800 --> 04:13:29.600
Let's move on.

04:13:30.560 --> 04:13:33.121
Good job, everybody in learning the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

04:13:33.120 --> 04:13:34.159
continuous
tense.

04:13:34.800 --> 04:13:38.720
This tense can be a little difficult and a
little tricky.

04:13:39.279 --> 04:13:42.559
Especially when it comes to the ‘when’
and ‘while’ usage.

04:13:43.120 --> 04:13:46.880
It'll take some practice to really master
it, but I know you can do it.

04:13:47.439 --> 04:13:53.839
Keep studying English and I'll see you in
the next video.&nbsp;

04:13:59.120 --> 04:14:00.080
Hi, everybody.

04:14:00.080 --> 04:14:01.279
I'm Esther.

04:14:01.279 --> 04:14:04.800
In this video, I will introduce the past perfect
tense.

04:14:05.439 --> 04:14:11.359
This tense is used to describe an action that
took place at a specific time in the past.

04:14:12.080 --> 04:14:16.960
This tense can be a little tricky,
but don't worry I will guide you through it.

04:14:16.960 --> 04:14:20.159
There's so much to learn and it's a very important
tense.

04:14:20.159 --> 04:14:21.840
So keep watching.

04:14:24.560 --> 04:14:28.400
Let's take a look at the first usage of the
past perfect tense.

04:14:29.120 --> 04:14:32.960
This tense can be used to describe an action
in the past

04:14:32.960 --> 04:14:35.840
that happened before another action in the
past.

04:14:36.479 --> 04:14:37.759
Here are some examples.

04:14:38.640 --> 04:14:41.600
‘I have visited China before I moved there.’

04:14:42.399 --> 04:14:45.679
No matter what the subject you follow with
‘had’,

04:14:45.680 --> 04:14:46.640
So that's easy.

04:14:47.199 --> 04:14:49.679
‘I had’
‘Steve had’

04:14:49.680 --> 04:14:51.840
‘The plane had’
and ‘We had’.

04:14:52.800 --> 04:14:56.239
Then, we follow with the past participle of
the verb.

04:14:56.800 --> 04:14:58.560
In this case, it's ‘visited’.

04:14:59.359 --> 04:15:00.960
‘I had visited China.’

04:15:01.680 --> 04:15:06.080
Now you'll notice that the second verb is
in the past simple tense.

04:15:06.080 --> 04:15:07.199
‘I moved there.’

04:15:07.760 --> 04:15:10.640
And I'll talk about that a little bit more
later on.

04:15:11.760 --> 04:15:13.199
‘Steve had bought the book.’

04:15:13.760 --> 04:15:18.080
Again, ‘subject’, ‘had’ and ‘past
participle’.

04:15:18.080 --> 04:15:19.840
In this case, the verb is ‘buy’.

04:15:20.800 --> 04:15:24.320
‘Steve had bought the book before he read
it.’

04:15:25.040 --> 04:15:28.880
Again, we have the simple tense of ‘read’
which is ‘read’.

04:15:29.920 --> 04:15:34.720
And finally, ‘The plane had left by the
time I got to the airport.’

04:15:35.359 --> 04:15:40.239
Again, the first part of this sentence is
in the past perfect tense.

04:15:40.239 --> 04:15:41.679
‘The plane had left’.

04:15:42.319 --> 04:15:45.040
This is the past participle of ‘leave’.

04:15:45.760 --> 04:15:49.360
The second verb says, ‘I got to the airport.’

04:15:49.359 --> 04:15:51.759
‘got’ is the past tense of ‘get’.

04:15:52.640 --> 04:15:58.560
Now what these three sentences have in common
is that you'll see, ‘before’.

04:15:59.359 --> 04:16:01.199
‘before’ or ‘by the time’.

04:16:01.760 --> 04:16:03.280
They all mean the same thing.

04:16:04.399 --> 04:16:08.559
The verb that is in the past perfect tense
happened first.

04:16:09.359 --> 04:16:12.719
The verb that's in the past simple tense happen
after.

04:16:13.359 --> 04:16:16.000
So again, for the first example.

04:16:16.000 --> 04:16:19.520
‘before I move there’
That happened later.

04:16:20.239 --> 04:16:23.359
Before that, ‘I had already visited China.’

04:16:24.000 --> 04:16:25.520
Do you understand how that works?

04:16:26.239 --> 04:16:28.319
Let's take a look at the last example.

04:16:29.040 --> 04:16:32.479
‘When they arrived, we had already started
the game.’

04:16:33.120 --> 04:16:36.239
So maybe they were late or something had happened.

04:16:36.239 --> 04:16:40.719
But ‘When they arrived’, this is the past
simple tense.

04:16:40.720 --> 04:16:43.199
So this happened second.

04:16:43.199 --> 04:16:45.439
‘We had already started the game.’

04:16:46.319 --> 04:16:49.279
This action had already started.

04:16:49.279 --> 04:16:51.679
It started before this action.

04:16:52.720 --> 04:16:53.520
Let's move on.

04:16:54.080 --> 04:16:59.519
Earlier I mentioned that the past perfect
tense can be used to describe an action

04:16:59.520 --> 04:17:03.520
that happened in the past before another action
in the past.

04:17:04.080 --> 04:17:08.399
We can do the same thing but also emphasize
the duration.

04:17:08.399 --> 04:17:10.719
How long that first action happened.

04:17:11.279 --> 04:17:14.479
We do this by using four and a duration.

04:17:15.120 --> 04:17:16.000
Let's take a look.

04:17:16.960 --> 04:17:21.199
‘I had owned my computer for two months
before it broke.’

04:17:22.000 --> 04:17:24.479
This is very similar to the first usage.

04:17:25.359 --> 04:17:29.519
‘I had’ and the past participle of the
verb.

04:17:30.399 --> 04:17:34.159
This part shows the action that happened earlier
in the past.

04:17:34.880 --> 04:17:36.880
The second part, ‘it broke’.

04:17:37.520 --> 04:17:41.600
The past simple tense verb shows the action
in the past

04:17:41.600 --> 04:17:44.080
that happened later than the first action.

04:17:44.960 --> 04:17:50.080
However, you'll notice that this sentence
has a duration, ‘for two months’.

04:17:50.800 --> 04:17:54.640
‘I had owned my computer for two months
before it broke.’

04:17:55.439 --> 04:18:00.399
All I'm doing here is showing how long the
first action had been true.

04:18:01.120 --> 04:18:03.199
Let's take a look at the next example.

04:18:04.080 --> 04:18:08.880
‘Jim had been lonely for a long time until
he got a puppy.’

04:18:09.600 --> 04:18:14.480
Again, we have subject ‘had’, past participle.

04:18:14.479 --> 04:18:18.879
And then we have the past simple ‘he got
a puppy’.

04:18:19.760 --> 04:18:25.040
All we're doing here is emphasizing
how long first action had been true.

04:18:25.600 --> 04:18:28.400
He had been lonely for a long time.

04:18:29.120 --> 04:18:34.000
That is until the later action, ‘he got
a puppy.’

04:18:34.000 --> 04:18:40.239
And finally, ‘She and I had been friends
for many years before she became my wife.’

04:18:41.520 --> 04:18:44.960
The first part of the sentence is the past
perfect.

04:18:44.960 --> 04:18:48.399
It happened before she became my wife.

04:18:49.120 --> 04:18:54.000
But I want to explain how long that had been
true for many years.

04:18:54.800 --> 04:18:56.000
Let's move on.

04:18:56.000 --> 04:19:00.800
Now I'll introduce how to form the negative
in the past perfect tense.

04:19:01.359 --> 04:19:02.399
Take a look at the board.

04:19:03.040 --> 04:19:09.120
The first sentence says, ‘I had not eaten
at the restaurant before I went yesterday.’

04:19:09.840 --> 04:19:16.239
Again, we have the past perfect tense here
and the past simple tense here.

04:19:16.239 --> 04:19:20.080
This one is the action that happened earlier
in the past

04:19:20.080 --> 04:19:24.720
And this one over here is the action that
happened later in the past.

04:19:25.439 --> 04:19:31.599
However, because this is the negative,
what I'm going to do is add a 'not' between

04:19:31.600 --> 04:19:35.040
the ‘had’ and the past participle of the
verb.

04:19:35.760 --> 04:19:38.640
So I say, ‘I have not eaten’.

04:19:39.199 --> 04:19:41.279
Or I can use the contraction

04:19:41.279 --> 04:19:46.479
and say, ‘I hadn't eaten at the restaurant
before I went yesterday.’

04:19:47.199 --> 04:19:49.279
The next sentence is very similar.’

04:19:49.840 --> 04:19:53.920
‘She had not been to the circus before she
went last week.’

04:19:54.720 --> 04:19:58.320
Here's the action that happened earlier in
the past,

04:19:58.319 --> 04:20:02.000
and here's the action that happened later
in the past.

04:20:02.560 --> 04:20:05.680
However, again, because it's negative,

04:20:05.680 --> 04:20:10.800
I put a 'not' between ‘had’ and the past
participle of the verb.

04:20:11.520 --> 04:20:16.800
Also, I can use the contraction and say,
‘She hadn't been to the circus.’

04:20:18.159 --> 04:20:19.680
The next sentence says,

04:20:19.680 --> 04:20:24.800
‘The cat hadn't chased the bird for very
long before it flew away.’

04:20:25.520 --> 04:20:28.000
Remember, we can show duration,

04:20:28.000 --> 04:20:30.960
or how long the first action was true.

04:20:30.960 --> 04:20:33.439
by using 'for' and a duration.

04:20:34.399 --> 04:20:36.639
Because this is the negative form,

04:20:36.640 --> 04:20:43.920
again, I use 'had not' after the subject and
before the past participle of the verb

04:20:43.920 --> 04:20:47.920
In this case, the contraction ‘hadn't’
is already there for you.

04:20:49.040 --> 04:20:53.840
‘We hadn't known each other for three months
before we married.’

04:20:54.399 --> 04:20:56.319
That's a pretty short time.

04:20:56.319 --> 04:21:00.080
It shows the duration by saying ‘for’,
How long?

04:21:00.080 --> 04:21:00.880
‘three months’

04:21:01.680 --> 04:21:02.480
Let's move on.

04:21:03.120 --> 04:21:08.239
Now, let's take a look at questions using
‘had’ in the past perfect tense.

04:21:08.880 --> 04:21:11.040
Take a look at the first sentence.

04:21:11.040 --> 04:21:14.399
It says, ‘She had eaten lunch by noon.’

04:21:15.199 --> 04:21:18.960
Now, to turn this into a question is quite
easy.

04:21:18.960 --> 04:21:22.399
All you have to do is change the order of
the first two words.

04:21:22.960 --> 04:21:26.319
So instead of ‘she had’, we say ‘Had
she’.

04:21:27.040 --> 04:21:29.040
‘Had she eaten lunch by noon?’

04:21:30.000 --> 04:21:32.319
You can say,
‘Yes, she had.’

04:21:32.319 --> 04:21:34.000
or ‘No, she hadn't.’

04:21:34.880 --> 04:21:38.560
The next sentence says,
‘It had rained before they left.’

04:21:39.279 --> 04:21:43.599
Again simply switched the order of the first
two words.

04:21:43.600 --> 04:21:47.520
Instead of ‘It had’, say ‘Had it’
to make a question.

04:21:48.399 --> 04:21:50.319
‘Had it rained before they left?’

04:21:51.199 --> 04:21:54.479
To reply you can say,
‘Yes, it had.’

04:21:54.479 --> 04:21:56.399
or ‘No, it hadn't.’

04:21:57.120 --> 04:21:59.199
Let's move on now.

04:21:59.199 --> 04:22:03.840
I'll go into how to form ‘WH’ questions
in the past perfect tense.

04:22:04.399 --> 04:22:05.199
Let's take a look.

04:22:06.239 --> 04:22:10.639
Here we see at the beginning
of each question a 'WH' word.

04:22:11.359 --> 04:22:15.040
‘where’, ‘who’, ‘what’,
and ‘how’.

04:22:16.399 --> 04:22:18.399
Let's take a look at the first question.

04:22:19.359 --> 04:22:21.599
‘Where had he traveled before?’

04:22:22.399 --> 04:22:26.799
You'll notice that after each ‘WH’ word,
we have ‘had’.

04:22:27.760 --> 04:22:32.720
And then the subject and then the
past participle of the verb.

04:22:33.439 --> 04:22:35.599
‘Where had he traveled before?’

04:22:36.880 --> 04:22:40.800
The next question says,
‘Who had she talked to before?’

04:22:41.600 --> 04:22:44.800
This is the same thing the ‘WH’ word

04:22:45.359 --> 04:22:48.239
‘had she’ and then the past participle.

04:22:49.040 --> 04:22:55.439
You'll notice here that we have the word ‘before’,
but we didn't write a specific point in time.

04:22:56.239 --> 04:22:59.840
If you see that it simply means before now.

04:23:00.399 --> 04:23:04.799
The next question says,
‘What had he eaten before lunch?’

04:23:05.760 --> 04:23:11.280
Again we follow the same formula, however,
here it says ‘lunch for you'.

04:23:12.239 --> 04:23:13.679
The last one says,

04:23:13.680 --> 04:23:17.600
‘How long had she known him before she dated
him?’

04:23:18.560 --> 04:23:24.640
Again how long ‘had’ + ‘subject’ and
then the past participle.

04:23:25.439 --> 04:23:27.839
Let's take a look at how&nbsp;
to answer these questions.

04:23:29.359 --> 04:23:31.359
‘Where had he traveled before?’

04:23:32.239 --> 04:23:34.399
‘He had traveled to Europe.’

04:23:34.399 --> 04:23:35.839
is one possible answer.

04:23:37.199 --> 04:23:39.279
‘Who had she talked to before?’

04:23:40.159 --> 04:23:43.599
Here I can say, ‘She had talked to her brother.’

04:23:45.199 --> 04:23:47.599
‘What had he eaten before lunch?’

04:23:48.479 --> 04:23:51.040
‘He had eaten sushi before lunch.’

04:23:51.760 --> 04:23:56.560
And finally, ‘How long had she known him
before she dated him?’

04:23:57.279 --> 04:23:59.840
‘She had known him for three years.’

04:23:59.840 --> 04:24:01.680
That is one possible answer.

04:24:02.399 --> 04:24:03.279
Let's move on.

04:24:04.239 --> 04:24:10.479
Now let's take a look at some practice exercises
for the basic usage of the past perfect tense.

04:24:11.040 --> 04:24:12.720
Take a look at the first sentence.

04:24:13.359 --> 04:24:17.279
‘I blank for six hours before I had a break.’

04:24:17.920 --> 04:24:19.600
The verb here is ‘work’.

04:24:20.399 --> 04:24:23.519
Remember, we need to say ‘I had’.

04:24:23.520 --> 04:24:26.240
No matter what the subject is, say ‘had’.

04:24:28.720 --> 04:24:32.080
And then, you take the past participle of
the verb.

04:24:32.640 --> 04:24:38.080
In this case, we would say ‘worked’.

04:24:38.080 --> 04:24:41.920
‘I had worked for six hours before I had
a break.’

04:24:42.720 --> 04:24:46.080
For the next sentence, I want you to try the
negative form.

04:24:47.120 --> 04:24:51.840
‘We blank TV before we listened to the radio.’

04:24:53.040 --> 04:24:56.880
Remember, for the negative form, we say ‘had
not’

04:24:56.880 --> 04:24:59.199
or we use the contraction, ‘hadn't’.

04:25:01.359 --> 04:25:02.479
‘We hadn’t’.

04:25:03.199 --> 04:25:05.840
And then, we need the past participle.

04:25:08.960 --> 04:25:13.600
‘We hadn't watched TV before we listened
to the radio.’

04:25:14.479 --> 04:25:17.120
Now find the mistake in the next sentence.

04:25:19.680 --> 04:25:24.159
‘Reggie had it be to Mexico before he went
to Peru.’

04:25:24.880 --> 04:25:30.400
Well, we have the subject here
and for the negative, ‘hadn't’ is correct.

04:25:31.120 --> 04:25:35.760
However, we need the past participle of the
verb ‘be’.

04:25:36.560 --> 04:25:38.320
So the correct answer is,

04:25:38.319 --> 04:25:42.559
‘Reggie hadn't been to Mexico before he
went to Peru.’

04:25:43.520 --> 04:25:49.520
And finally, ‘Sally and Jan or they had
do their job.’

04:25:50.040 --> 04:25:51.040
Hmm.

04:25:51.040 --> 04:25:53.519
Remember, we need the past participle.

04:25:54.159 --> 04:25:55.599
We don't say do.

04:25:55.600 --> 04:25:56.880
We say ‘done’.

04:25:57.920 --> 04:26:02.480
‘Sally and Jan had done their job before
they watched TV.’

04:26:03.520 --> 04:26:04.560
Let's move on.

04:26:04.560 --> 04:26:08.400
In this checkup, we'll take a look at some
practice exercises

04:26:08.399 --> 04:26:12.319
for the past perfect tense that describes
how long.

04:26:12.319 --> 04:26:14.239
Let's take a look at the first sentence.

04:26:15.040 --> 04:26:19.760
‘You blank at the park for three hours before
you came home.’

04:26:20.720 --> 04:26:23.760
Remember, we start with the subject and then
‘had’.

04:26:24.560 --> 04:26:26.240
So I'm going to add that here,

04:26:27.040 --> 04:26:30.479
then we need the past participle of the verb
‘be’.

04:26:31.279 --> 04:26:32.719
And that is ‘been’.

04:26:34.159 --> 04:26:38.479
‘You had been at the park for three hours
before you came home.’

04:26:39.520 --> 04:26:40.720
The next sentence says,

04:26:41.279 --> 04:26:45.199
‘They blank for six hours before they took
a break.’

04:26:46.080 --> 04:26:51.519
Again, no matter what the subject,
we have ‘had’ and then the past participle.

04:26:52.080 --> 04:26:54.239
So the answer is,

04:26:54.239 --> 04:27:00.080
‘They had studied for six hours before they
took a break.’

04:27:00.960 --> 04:27:04.080
Now, find the mistake in the next sentence.

04:27:04.080 --> 04:27:06.960
It's a little bit longer so it might take
you a while.

04:27:08.640 --> 04:27:14.000
‘They had been known each other for ten
years before they had their first fight.’

04:27:14.960 --> 04:27:16.239
Can you find the mistake?

04:27:17.199 --> 04:27:21.120
Well, we have the subject and ‘had’,
but check this out.

04:27:21.120 --> 04:27:24.000
There are two past participles here.

04:27:24.000 --> 04:27:25.840
We need to get rid of one of them.

04:27:27.279 --> 04:27:33.599
We can take out this verb and say,
‘They had known each other for ten years

04:27:33.600 --> 04:27:35.520
before they had their first fight.’

04:27:36.800 --> 04:27:43.360
The next sentence says, ‘I have played soccer
for many years before I scored my first goal.’

04:27:44.560 --> 04:27:47.920
This sentence doesn't look wrong at first.

04:27:47.920 --> 04:27:51.760
But remember, in the past perfect tense, we
need to say ‘had’.

04:27:52.479 --> 04:27:59.040
‘I had played soccer for many years before
I scored my first goal.’

04:28:00.080 --> 04:28:01.279
Good job, everybody.

04:28:01.279 --> 04:28:02.479
Let's move on.

04:28:02.479 --> 04:28:04.000
Great job, everyone.

04:28:04.000 --> 04:28:08.319
Now you have a better understanding of the
past perfect tense.

04:28:08.319 --> 04:28:11.519
I know it can be a little difficult but keep
studying,

04:28:11.520 --> 04:28:13.760
and keep practicing,
and you will get better.

04:28:14.479 --> 04:28:18.559
I know studying English is not easy but with
time and effort,

04:28:18.560 --> 04:28:20.240
I know you'll master it.

04:28:20.239 --> 04:28:23.359
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next video.

04:28:31.840 --> 04:28:32.880
Hi, everybody.

04:28:32.880 --> 04:28:34.159
I'm Esther.

04:28:34.159 --> 04:28:38.479
In this video, I will introduce the past perfect
continuous tense.

04:28:39.040 --> 04:28:42.800
It's a great tense that helps you express
an ongoing action

04:28:42.800 --> 04:28:46.720
in the past continuing up to another point
in the past.

04:28:46.720 --> 04:28:49.840
There's a lot to learn, so keep watching.

04:28:52.319 --> 04:28:58.639
One usage of the past perfect continuous tense
is to talk about an ongoing action in the

04:28:58.640 --> 04:29:01.920
past
that continued up to another point in the

04:29:01.920 --> 04:29:02.319
past.

04:29:02.880 --> 04:29:06.480
You can use ‘for’ and a duration to talk
about

04:29:06.479 --> 04:29:08.879
how long that action was in progress.

04:29:09.439 --> 04:29:10.719
Here are some examples.

04:29:11.359 --> 04:29:16.159
‘I had been waiting for the bus for two
hours before it arrived.’

04:29:16.800 --> 04:29:18.640
You'll notice that at the beginning.

04:29:18.640 --> 04:29:23.040
It doesn't matter what the subject is, we
follow with ‘had been’.

04:29:23.600 --> 04:29:27.520
For example, ‘I had been’,
‘Chuck had been’,

04:29:27.520 --> 04:29:29.680
And ‘Tom and Kim had been.’

04:29:30.479 --> 04:29:33.199
And then we follow with the verb ‘-ing’.

04:29:33.920 --> 04:29:34.399
‘waiting’.

04:29:35.040 --> 04:29:36.880
‘I had been waiting.’

04:29:36.880 --> 04:29:40.319
Now this is the ongoing action that happened
first.

04:29:41.040 --> 04:29:44.880
Again, four and two hours shows the duration.

04:29:45.680 --> 04:29:48.720
The second part says, ‘it arrived’.

04:29:48.720 --> 04:29:51.680
This verb is in the past simple tense.

04:29:51.680 --> 04:29:54.240
Therefore, that is the second action.

04:29:54.239 --> 04:30:00.960
It's the action that this first action happened
until this action happened,

04:30:00.960 --> 04:30:04.399
so again,
‘I had been waiting for the bus,’ happened

04:30:04.399 --> 04:30:05.279
first.

04:30:05.279 --> 04:30:08.880
And then, it happened until the bus arrived.

04:30:10.399 --> 04:30:14.639
‘Chuck had been cooking,’
Again, that part's easy.

04:30:14.640 --> 04:30:19.360
No matter what’s the subject, we say ‘had
been’ and then verb ‘-ing’.

04:30:20.239 --> 04:30:26.800
Again, I can show how long Chuck had been
cooking by saying ‘for an hour’, showing

04:30:26.800 --> 04:30:28.320
the
duration.

04:30:28.319 --> 04:30:32.000
And then, I finished by saying, ‘before
he finished’.

04:30:32.000 --> 04:30:35.760
He had been cooking up to this point in the
past.

04:30:36.880 --> 04:30:43.120
Finally, ‘Tom and Kim had been walking,’
This part should be familiar to you by now,

04:30:43.760 --> 04:30:46.880
‘for an hour’
Again, that shows duration.

04:30:47.439 --> 04:30:48.879
‘before they rested.’

04:30:49.439 --> 04:30:55.040
So they had been walking for an hour before
they took a break.

04:30:55.040 --> 04:30:56.399
Before they rested.

04:30:56.960 --> 04:30:57.760
Let's move on.

04:30:58.640 --> 04:31:04.800
The past perfect continuous tense is also
used to express cause and effect in the

04:31:04.800 --> 04:31:05.279
past.

04:31:05.920 --> 04:31:10.880
The verb that's in the past perfect continuous
tense shows the cause,

04:31:10.880 --> 04:31:12.239
why something happened.

04:31:12.800 --> 04:31:17.840
We can use ‘because’ or ‘so’ to show
the cause and effect.

04:31:17.840 --> 04:31:18.960
Here, I'll explain.

04:31:19.840 --> 04:31:23.840
‘Jason was tired because he had been jogging.’

04:31:24.560 --> 04:31:27.760
The first part of the sentence is in the past
tense.

04:31:28.399 --> 04:31:33.040
‘Jason was tired,’
However, we see ‘why?’

04:31:33.040 --> 04:31:36.640
Well, because, ‘he had been jogging’.

04:31:36.640 --> 04:31:41.120
The second part of this sentence is in the
past perfect continuous tense.

04:31:41.680 --> 04:31:45.040
‘he had been’, remember no matter what
the subject,

04:31:45.040 --> 04:31:49.519
we follow with ‘had been’ and jogging
– ‘verb -ing’.

04:31:50.159 --> 04:31:55.359
‘he had been jogging’
This shows why Jason was tired.

04:31:56.319 --> 04:32:01.840
The next sentence says,
‘The pavement’ or it ‘was wet because

04:32:01.840 --> 04:32:02.960
it had been raining.’

04:32:03.840 --> 04:32:09.120
Similar to the first sentence, ‘it had been
raining’ shows the cause.

04:32:09.120 --> 04:32:10.800
Why was the pavement wet?

04:32:11.439 --> 04:32:15.359
‘The pavement was wet because it had been
raining.’

04:32:16.640 --> 04:32:19.520
In this sentence, we see a little difference.

04:32:19.520 --> 04:32:25.200
‘The children had been playing’
Again, this is the past perfect continuous

04:32:25.199 --> 04:32:25.519
tense.

04:32:26.239 --> 04:32:31.439
‘had been playing’
The second part says, ‘the room was a mess’.

04:32:31.439 --> 04:32:35.679
So here, instead of ‘because’ like the
first two sentences,

04:32:35.680 --> 04:32:37.200
I used ‘so’.

04:32:37.199 --> 04:32:40.960
So the order has been changed but the meaning
is the same.

04:32:41.840 --> 04:32:47.920
This, ‘the children had been playing’
is why the room was a mess.

04:32:47.920 --> 04:32:51.680
This is the cause and this is the effect.

04:32:52.479 --> 04:32:53.279
Let's move on.

04:32:54.319 --> 04:32:59.120
Now let's go into the negative form of the
past perfect continuous tense.

04:32:59.760 --> 04:33:01.920
Here are some examples.

04:33:01.920 --> 04:33:05.520
‘I had not been working for a day before
I quit.’

04:33:06.240 --> 04:33:11.119
So no matter what the subject ‘I’, ‘you’,
‘she’, or ‘it’,

04:33:11.760 --> 04:33:18.000
just like in the affirmative, we say ‘had’,
but after the ‘had’, in the negative form,

04:33:18.000 --> 04:33:20.320
we add ‘not’.
‘had not’

04:33:20.879 --> 04:33:25.359
‘had not’
or you can use the contraction ‘hadn't’.

04:33:25.359 --> 04:33:28.638
Which is a combination of ‘had’ and ‘not’
together.

04:33:29.680 --> 04:33:34.401
‘I had not been working’
The rest of the sentence is the same.

04:33:34.400 --> 04:33:40.240
‘been + verb -ing’
‘I had not been working for a day before

04:33:40.240 --> 04:33:40.799
I quit.’

04:33:41.920 --> 04:33:46.799
The next sentence says,
‘You had not been cutting onions for long

04:33:46.799 --> 04:33:47.920
before you cried.’

04:33:48.561 --> 04:33:52.081
Again, the ‘not’ goes between ‘had’
and ‘been’.

04:33:53.520 --> 04:33:57.920
‘She hadn't been studying for long when
she fell asleep.’

04:33:57.920 --> 04:33:59.600
Here, we have the contraction.

04:34:00.719 --> 04:34:04.160
And finally,
‘It hadn't been snowing for long when it

04:34:04.160 --> 04:34:04.560
stopped.’

04:34:05.199 --> 04:34:08.240
Again, we have the contraction for ‘had
not’ here.

04:34:09.039 --> 04:34:12.639
You'll notice that in the first two sentences,
I used ‘before’.

04:34:13.199 --> 04:34:15.279
And in the last two, I used ‘when’.

04:34:16.240 --> 04:34:20.400
Either one can be used to show when the first
action stopped.

04:34:21.119 --> 04:34:21.920
Let's move on.

04:34:22.639 --> 04:34:28.639
Now let's go into how to form basic questions
in the past perfect continuous tense.

04:34:29.279 --> 04:34:30.879
Here is the first example.

04:34:31.680 --> 04:34:35.280
‘He had been driving all day before he arrived.’

04:34:35.840 --> 04:34:41.520
Now, to turn this into a question, all we
have to do is change the order of the first

04:34:41.520 --> 04:34:42.241
two words.

04:34:42.799 --> 04:34:48.401
Instead of ‘He had’, now I can say, ‘Had
he’, in order to form a question.

04:34:49.199 --> 04:34:53.840
‘Had he been driving all day before he arrived?’

04:34:53.840 --> 04:34:58.639
The next sentence says,
‘The dog had been barking because it was

04:34:58.639 --> 04:34:59.119
scared.’

04:34:59.840 --> 04:35:02.401
In this case, the subject is ‘The dog’.

04:35:03.199 --> 04:35:04.879
And then we follow with ‘had’.

04:35:05.680 --> 04:35:09.520
To turn this into a question, again, we switch
the order.

04:35:10.240 --> 04:35:14.000
‘Had the dog been barking because it was
scared?’

04:35:14.639 --> 04:35:20.080
You'll notice that in the question, the rest
of the words stay in the same place.

04:35:20.959 --> 04:35:26.160
Now, in the first question, we're asking how
long an action happened,

04:35:26.160 --> 04:35:28.879
or how long it was ongoing in the past.

04:35:29.439 --> 04:35:33.119
And in this question, we ask about cause and
effect.

04:35:33.760 --> 04:35:34.561
Let's move on.

04:35:35.279 --> 04:35:41.519
Now, I'll introduce how to form WH questions
in the past perfect continuous tense.

04:35:42.080 --> 04:35:44.240
Take a look at these examples.

04:35:44.240 --> 04:35:47.519
You'll notice that they all start with a WH
word.

04:35:48.080 --> 04:35:51.279
Why, where, what, and who.

04:35:52.160 --> 04:35:55.760
You might also have noticed that after we
have ‘had’.

04:35:56.400 --> 04:35:58.718
‘Why had’
‘Where had’

04:35:58.719 --> 04:36:00.719
‘What had’
and ‘Who had’

04:36:01.680 --> 04:36:05.520
In the first question, after that comes the
subject.

04:36:06.240 --> 04:36:10.799
‘Why had you’
And then ‘been + verb -ing’

04:36:11.520 --> 04:36:15.200
And that's the same pattern we follow for
all of these sentences.

04:36:15.760 --> 04:36:19.280
So ‘Why had you been studying so much?’

04:36:19.279 --> 04:36:24.080
I can answer by saying,
‘I had been studying so much because I have

04:36:24.080 --> 04:36:24.560
a test.’

04:36:26.080 --> 04:36:29.359
‘Where had you been traveling before you
came here?’

04:36:30.160 --> 04:36:33.680
I can say,
‘I had been traveling through Asia.’

04:36:35.279 --> 04:36:39.039
‘What had they been playing before they
played soccer?’

04:36:39.760 --> 04:36:42.879
I can answer, ‘They had been playing baseball.’

04:36:43.600 --> 04:36:48.321
And finally,
‘Who had she been talking to before she

04:36:48.320 --> 04:36:49.039
left home?’

04:36:49.680 --> 04:36:53.200
I can answer, ‘She had been talking to her
boyfriend.’

04:36:54.000 --> 04:36:54.799
Let's move on.

04:36:55.600 --> 04:36:59.920
Let's start a checkup for the past perfect
continuous tense.

04:36:59.920 --> 04:37:02.080
Take a look at the first sentence.

04:37:02.080 --> 04:37:07.039
It says, ‘They __ for a long time before
they went home.’

04:37:07.920 --> 04:37:11.760
Try to fill in the blank with the verb ‘work’
in this tense.

04:37:13.520 --> 04:37:18.799
Remember, no matter what the subject,
we follow the subject with ‘had been’.

04:37:19.840 --> 04:37:22.719
So we say, ‘They had been’.

04:37:23.840 --> 04:37:25.199
What happens to the verb?

04:37:25.760 --> 04:37:27.840
Remember, we add ‘-ing’.

04:37:30.400 --> 04:37:36.798
So the sentence is, ‘They had been working
for a long time before they went home.’

04:37:37.840 --> 04:37:40.401
Now, take a look at the second sentence.

04:37:40.959 --> 04:37:42.959
I want you to use the negative.

04:37:43.760 --> 04:37:48.561
‘I __ TV for a year before I started again.’

04:37:49.680 --> 04:37:54.321
Remember, the negative form for this tense
starts with the subject

04:37:54.320 --> 04:37:56.320
and then ‘had not been’.

04:37:59.039 --> 04:38:01.439
Or I can use the contraction ‘hadn't’.

04:38:02.080 --> 04:38:07.840
‘I hadn't been’
And then again, verb ‘-ing’.

04:38:09.039 --> 04:38:14.160
‘I hadn't been watching TV for a year before
I started again.’

04:38:15.119 --> 04:38:18.639
Now, try to find the mistake in this next
sentence.

04:38:21.279 --> 04:38:26.400
‘Gina and I hadn't been do any work before
we started.’

04:38:27.359 --> 04:38:28.240
What's the error?

04:38:29.279 --> 04:38:33.119
You'll notice that the verb does not have
an ‘-ing’.

04:38:36.719 --> 04:38:42.401
To make the sentence correct,
we must say, ‘Gina and I hadn't been doing

04:38:42.400 --> 04:38:44.480
any work before we started.’

04:38:45.439 --> 04:38:47.199
Now, find the mistake here.

04:38:48.320 --> 04:38:53.279
‘He had be watching YouTube because he had
some free time.’

04:38:55.279 --> 04:39:01.519
‘He had’, that's correct, but we need
to change ‘be’ to been’.

04:39:02.400 --> 04:39:04.000
And ‘watching’ is correct.

04:39:04.000 --> 04:39:09.279
So, ‘He had been watching YouTube because
he had some free time.’

04:39:10.000 --> 04:39:10.799
Let's move on.

04:39:11.600 --> 04:39:16.561
Now, let's move on to another checkup of the
past perfect continuous tense.

04:39:17.119 --> 04:39:18.959
Take a look at the first example.

04:39:19.600 --> 04:39:24.241
It says, ‘The company __ employees because
they worked hard.’

04:39:25.039 --> 04:39:29.279
Use the verb ‘promote’ in the past perfect
continuous tense.

04:39:30.480 --> 04:39:34.959
Remember, no matter what the subject, we follow
with ‘had been’.

04:39:35.680 --> 04:39:43.520
So we say, ‘The company had been’ and
then verb ‘-ing’, so ‘promoting’.

04:39:46.959 --> 04:39:51.520
‘The company had been promoting employees
because they worked hard.’

04:39:52.320 --> 04:39:58.638
The next example says, ‘I __ your emails
for a while because they went to the spam

04:39:58.639 --> 04:39:59.119
folder.’

04:39:59.840 --> 04:40:03.440
Here, try to use the negative form with the
verb ‘get’.

04:40:05.199 --> 04:40:10.080
Remember, in the negative form, we say ‘had
not been getting’

04:40:10.959 --> 04:40:15.840
Or the contraction ‘hadn't been getting’.

04:40:17.520 --> 04:40:23.360
‘I hadn't been getting your emails for a
while because they went to the spam folder.’

04:40:24.240 --> 04:40:27.119
Now look for the mistake in the next sentence.

04:40:29.840 --> 04:40:33.840
‘I had been work a lot because I needed
the money.’

04:40:34.480 --> 04:40:35.519
What's the mistake?

04:40:36.240 --> 04:40:41.439
Remember, we need to add ‘-ing’ to the
verb.

04:40:42.400 --> 04:40:46.160
‘I had been working a lot because I needed
the money.’

04:40:47.039 --> 04:40:52.560
The last sentence says,
‘He has been smoking because he was stressed.’

04:40:53.439 --> 04:40:54.638
Can you find the mistake?

04:40:55.920 --> 04:40:59.440
Remember, we're practicing the past perfect
continuous.

04:41:00.000 --> 04:41:05.359
In this case, we need ‘had’ after the
subject, not ‘has’.

04:41:06.240 --> 04:41:07.519
Great job, everyone.

04:41:07.520 --> 04:41:08.719
Let's move on.

04:41:08.719 --> 04:41:12.879
Thank you so much for watching this&nbsp;
grammar course on the past tense.&nbsp;

04:41:12.879 --> 04:41:17.119
Now, if you haven’t had a chance to check&nbsp;
out my grammar course on the present tense&nbsp;&nbsp;

04:41:17.119 --> 04:41:22.080
or the future tense, make sure you do that now.
Thank you again for watching and I will see you&nbsp;&nbsp;

04:41:22.080 --> 04:41:25.840
next time.
Bye.&nbsp;

04:41:32.240 --> 04:41:33.119
Hi, everyone.

04:41:33.119 --> 04:41:34.320
I'm Esther.

04:41:34.320 --> 04:41:37.679
In this video, I will introduce the future
simple tense

04:41:37.680 --> 04:41:39.840
using 'will' and 'be going to'.

04:41:40.561 --> 04:41:46.161
This is a very important tense that will help
you express future actions and plans.

04:41:46.160 --> 04:41:48.480
There's a lot to learn, so let's get started.

04:41:51.920 --> 04:41:55.840
The future simple tense can be used to express
a future action.

04:41:56.400 --> 04:41:58.160
Let's take a look at some examples.

04:41:58.959 --> 04:41:59.840
‘I'm cold.’

04:42:00.400 --> 04:42:01.599
Well that's right now.

04:42:02.480 --> 04:42:04.080
‘I will close the window.’

04:42:04.879 --> 04:42:07.680
We start with the subject ‘will’.

04:42:07.680 --> 04:42:09.520
And then, the base verb.

04:42:09.520 --> 04:42:10.879
‘I will close the window.’

04:42:11.600 --> 04:42:16.080
In this example, I'm making a sudden decision
because how I feel right now.

04:42:17.199 --> 04:42:22.000
I will close the window because I'm cold right
now.

04:42:22.000 --> 04:42:24.561
‘I will be at the library tomorrow.’

04:42:25.359 --> 04:42:28.480
Again, you start with the subject and then
‘will’.

04:42:29.439 --> 04:42:31.599
After that, you have the base verb.

04:42:32.320 --> 04:42:35.840
You can use the ‘be’ verb to talk about
a confirmed plan.

04:42:36.639 --> 04:42:39.039
‘I will be at the library tomorrow.’

04:42:40.320 --> 04:42:43.199
The economy will get better next year.

04:42:43.920 --> 04:42:46.639
In this case, the subject is ‘the economy’.

04:42:47.439 --> 04:42:50.959
Again, we follow with ‘will’ and the base
verb ‘get’.

04:42:51.680 --> 04:42:54.719
‘The economy will get better next year.’

04:42:54.719 --> 04:42:58.879
I'm making a prediction here about something
that will happen in the future.

04:42:59.680 --> 04:43:02.719
And finally, ‘I will help you with your
homework.’

04:43:03.439 --> 04:43:05.839
I'm making a future plan to help you.

04:43:06.561 --> 04:43:09.360
‘I will help you with your homework.’

04:43:09.359 --> 04:43:12.879
It doesn't say when but I am talking about
the future.

04:43:13.439 --> 04:43:14.240
Let's move on.

04:43:15.119 --> 04:43:20.000
You can also use ‘be going to’ to express
a future action.

04:43:20.000 --> 04:43:22.080
It's almost the same as ‘will’.

04:43:22.639 --> 04:43:24.000
Here are some examples.

04:43:24.879 --> 04:43:26.080
‘There's no milk.

04:43:26.719 --> 04:43:28.401
I'm going to buy some.’

04:43:29.119 --> 04:43:33.599
So what you see here is the subject and then
the ‘be’ verb - ‘am’.

04:43:34.320 --> 04:43:35.119
‘I am’

04:43:35.840 --> 04:43:39.119
And then here we used a contraction
‘I'm’.

04:43:39.920 --> 04:43:42.000
‘I'm going to buy some.’

04:43:42.000 --> 04:43:45.840
I made a decision to buy some because there's
no milk.

04:43:46.561 --> 04:43:51.120
The next sentence says,
‘It looks like it's going to snow tomorrow.’

04:43:51.920 --> 04:43:56.535
Here the subject is ‘it’ and so I use
the ‘be’ verb – ‘is’.

04:43:56.535 --> 04:43:56.879
‘it is’

04:43:57.439 --> 04:44:00.638
‘It's’ is the contraction.

04:44:01.520 --> 04:44:05.600
‘It's going to’
And then we use the base verb ‘snow’.

04:44:06.719 --> 04:44:10.639
The word ‘tomorrow’ shows that this is
a future action.

04:44:12.080 --> 04:44:14.879
‘He's going to take a trip in the summer.’

04:44:15.840 --> 04:44:20.160
Because the subject is ‘he’, we use the
‘be’ verb – is.

04:44:20.160 --> 04:44:26.560
And we can use the contraction ‘he's’.
‘he is’ or ‘he's’ going to

04:44:26.561 --> 04:44:28.481
And then the base verb ‘take’

04:44:29.199 --> 04:44:31.519
‘take a trip in the summer’

04:44:31.520 --> 04:44:34.321
Again an action happening in the future.

04:44:34.879 --> 04:44:35.680
Let's move on.

04:44:36.320 --> 04:44:39.279
Now, let's take a look at the negative form
of

04:44:39.279 --> 04:44:40.718
the future simple tense.

04:44:41.359 --> 04:44:45.920
The first example says,
‘Stan will not like his English score.’

04:44:46.561 --> 04:44:51.680
No matter what the subject is,
we follow with ‘will not’ and then the

04:44:51.680 --> 04:44:52.959
base form of the verb.

04:44:53.680 --> 04:44:56.799
‘Stan will not like his English score.’

04:44:58.000 --> 04:45:00.639
‘We won't give you money anymore.’

04:45:01.199 --> 04:45:03.840
In this case, the subject is ‘we’.

04:45:03.840 --> 04:45:06.320
And we follow with the contraction ‘won't’.

04:45:07.039 --> 04:45:10.959
It sounds really different and it's different
from other contractions,

04:45:10.959 --> 04:45:14.080
but ‘won't’ is the contraction for ‘will
not’

04:45:14.639 --> 04:45:18.799
so you can say ‘we will not’ or ‘we
won't’.

04:45:18.799 --> 04:45:19.520
They're the same.

04:45:20.320 --> 04:45:22.560
‘We won't give you money anymore.’

04:45:23.119 --> 04:45:26.959
Again, you notice the base verb ‘give’
after ‘not’.

04:45:28.320 --> 04:45:31.840
‘He is not going to fly until next week.’

04:45:32.719 --> 04:45:35.039
This sentence uses ‘be going to’.

04:45:35.840 --> 04:45:38.160
The subject is ‘he’.

04:45:38.160 --> 04:45:41.119
And therefore the ‘be’ verb we use is
– ‘is’

04:45:42.080 --> 04:45:45.600
However we put a ‘not’ after the ‘be’
verb.

04:45:46.320 --> 04:45:50.638
‘He is not going to …’
And then the base verb.

04:45:51.680 --> 04:45:55.600
‘He is not going to fly until next week.’

04:45:56.561 --> 04:46:01.760
The last sentence says,
‘You are not going to go to the party tonight.’

04:46:02.719 --> 04:46:06.561
The subject is ‘you’ and so we use the
‘be’ verb – ‘are’.

04:46:07.279 --> 04:46:11.359
‘You are not going to go …’
That's the base verb.

04:46:11.359 --> 04:46:13.039
‘… to the party tonight.’

04:46:13.840 --> 04:46:14.959
Let's move on.

04:46:14.959 --> 04:46:20.080
Now let's take a look at how to form basic
questions in the future simple tense.

04:46:21.119 --> 04:46:23.760
The first sentence says,
‘He will play with us.’

04:46:24.879 --> 04:46:29.520
To turn this into a question,
all we have to do is change the order of the

04:46:29.520 --> 04:46:30.481
first two words.

04:46:31.039 --> 04:46:34.240
So ‘He will becomes ‘Will he’.

04:46:34.240 --> 04:46:35.599
‘Will he play with us?’

04:46:36.959 --> 04:46:40.400
‘The next sentence says,
‘He is going to play with us.’

04:46:41.199 --> 04:46:43.119
This one uses ‘be going to’.

04:46:43.840 --> 04:46:45.760
The subject is ‘he’.

04:46:45.760 --> 04:46:48.481
And so the ‘be’ verb to use is – ‘is’.

04:46:49.439 --> 04:46:52.560
Then we have ‘going to’ and then the base
verb.

04:46:53.199 --> 04:46:54.799
‘He is going to play with us.’

04:46:55.760 --> 04:47:00.959
When I make a question, I simply again change
the order of the first two words.

04:47:01.680 --> 04:47:03.840
‘Is he going to play with us?’

04:47:04.719 --> 04:47:09.199
Now if the subject were to be ‘you’ or
‘we’ or ‘they’,

04:47:09.199 --> 04:47:11.039
we would say ‘they are’.

04:47:11.039 --> 04:47:13.600
And so the question would say,
‘Are they'.

04:47:14.400 --> 04:47:16.638
'Are they going to play with them?’

04:47:16.639 --> 04:47:17.440
for example.

04:47:18.240 --> 04:47:23.039
So again, remember, for ‘will’ in the
future simple tense,

04:47:23.039 --> 04:47:27.359
just say ‘will’ subject and then the base
form of the verb.

04:47:28.080 --> 04:47:34.160
However for ‘be going to’ questions,
make sure that you pay attention to the proper

04:47:34.160 --> 04:47:36.959
'be' verb to use
at the beginning of the question.

04:47:37.760 --> 04:47:41.280
To answer the first question,
‘Will he play with us?’

04:47:41.279 --> 04:47:45.199
You can say ‘Yes, he will’ or ‘No, he
won't’.

04:47:46.400 --> 04:47:48.400
‘Is he going to play with us?’

04:47:48.400 --> 04:47:53.439
You can say, ‘Yes, he's going to’ or ‘No,
he isn't going to’.

04:47:54.320 --> 04:47:55.599
Let's move on.

04:47:55.600 --> 04:48:00.481
Let's look at how to form ‘WH’ questions
in the future simple tense.

04:48:01.439 --> 04:48:05.839
If you notice each question begins with a
‘WH’ word.

04:48:05.840 --> 04:48:06.160
Who

04:48:06.799 --> 04:48:07.119
When

04:48:07.680 --> 04:48:08.321
Where

04:48:08.320 --> 04:48:08.959
And What

04:48:10.080 --> 04:48:14.400
The first two sentences use ‘will’ for
the future simple tense.

04:48:15.039 --> 04:48:16.240
‘Who will win the game?’

04:48:17.199 --> 04:48:20.400
To answer I can say,
‘My team will win the game.’

04:48:21.680 --> 04:48:23.360
‘When will they arrive?’

04:48:24.240 --> 04:48:26.240
‘They will arrive in two hours.’

04:48:27.840 --> 04:48:31.279
Now these two sentences have ‘be going to’.

04:48:32.400 --> 04:48:34.400
‘Where is he going to study?’

04:48:35.119 --> 04:48:39.840
In this case, I have the ‘be’ verb – ‘is’
because the subject is ‘he’.

04:48:40.561 --> 04:48:42.481
‘Where is he going to study?’

04:48:43.119 --> 04:48:46.560
I can say, ‘He is going to study at the
library.’

04:48:47.119 --> 04:48:50.400
And finally,
‘What are you going to do?’

04:48:51.119 --> 04:48:55.599
In this case, I use the ‘be’ verb – ‘are’
because the subject is ‘you’.

04:48:56.400 --> 04:48:57.759
‘What are you going to do?’

04:48:58.639 --> 04:49:00.481
‘I am going to take a shower.’

04:49:01.279 --> 04:49:02.080
Let's move on.

04:49:02.639 --> 04:49:07.840
For this checkup let's take a look at the
will usage for the future simple tense.

04:49:08.561 --> 04:49:13.600
The first example says,
‘Jen and Paul [blank] home soon’

04:49:13.600 --> 04:49:14.799
with the verb ‘go’.

04:49:15.760 --> 04:49:19.760
Remember, when using ‘will’ for the future
simple tense,

04:49:19.760 --> 04:49:22.401
it doesn't matter what the subject is.

04:49:22.400 --> 04:49:25.359
We say ‘will’ and then the base verb.

04:49:25.359 --> 04:49:31.759
So here we can say, ‘Jen and Paul’ or
‘They will go home soon’.

04:49:33.119 --> 04:49:36.320
‘I [blank] a scientist after I graduate.’

04:49:37.359 --> 04:49:39.199
Try filling in the blank with ‘be’.

04:49:40.320 --> 04:49:43.679
Again, we simply say ‘will be’.

04:49:44.719 --> 04:49:48.160
‘I will be a scientist after I graduate.’

04:49:49.199 --> 04:49:55.119
Now try this one,
‘We [blank] that because it smells bad.’

04:49:55.119 --> 04:49:58.560
I want you to use the negative form with the
verb ‘eat’.

04:50:00.879 --> 04:50:09.520
Here we say, ‘will not eat’ or remember
we can use the contraction ‘won't’.

04:50:10.400 --> 04:50:16.080
‘We will not eat that’ or ‘We won't
eat that because it smells bad’.

04:50:17.119 --> 04:50:19.840
Now look for the mistake in this sentence.

04:50:22.719 --> 04:50:25.440
‘I will eat a pizza for lunch.’

04:50:26.480 --> 04:50:29.599
Remember, we need the base form of the verb.

04:50:30.320 --> 04:50:33.599
‘I will eat a pizza for lunch.’

04:50:34.879 --> 04:50:37.760
‘Angie and I will playing a game.’

04:50:38.719 --> 04:50:41.760
Again we need the base form of the verb.

04:50:42.480 --> 04:50:46.560
Angie and I will play a game.’

04:50:46.561 --> 04:50:49.840
And finally, ‘Will she be cook dinner?’

04:50:50.719 --> 04:50:51.840
This is a question.

04:50:52.719 --> 04:50:58.719
However we need to say,
‘Will she cook dinner.’

04:50:58.719 --> 04:51:00.879
We do not need a ‘be’ verb here.

04:51:01.600 --> 04:51:02.401
Let's move on.

04:51:03.199 --> 04:51:07.599
Let's practice the ‘be going to’ usage
of the future simple tense.

04:51:08.639 --> 04:51:11.920
‘We [blank] going to _blank_ soccer.’

04:51:12.561 --> 04:51:14.639
I want you to use the verb ‘watch’.

04:51:15.680 --> 04:51:19.680
Remember, for ‘be going to’ in the future
simple tense,

04:51:19.680 --> 04:51:22.719
we start with the subject and then the ‘be’
verb.

04:51:23.439 --> 04:51:25.359
The subject here is ‘we’.

04:51:25.359 --> 04:51:27.359
So we need the ‘be’ verb – ‘are’.

04:51:28.160 --> 04:51:32.879
‘We are going to’ and then the base verb
‘watch’.

04:51:35.199 --> 04:51:37.599
‘We are going to watch soccer.’

04:51:38.879 --> 04:51:41.920
‘I [blank] going to [blank].’

04:51:41.920 --> 04:51:43.440
The verb is ‘talk’.

04:51:43.439 --> 04:51:45.759
And I want you to use the negative form.

04:51:47.039 --> 04:51:49.439
In this case, the subject is ‘I’.

04:51:49.439 --> 04:51:51.679
And so I use the ‘be’ verb – ‘am’.

04:51:52.959 --> 04:51:55.840
‘I am’ and then we need ‘not’.

04:51:56.799 --> 04:51:58.401
‘I am not going to’

04:52:00.799 --> 04:52:02.719
Then the base verb ‘talk’.

04:52:04.160 --> 04:52:06.639
‘Why [blank] you going to [blank]?’

04:52:07.199 --> 04:52:08.560
The verb here is ‘go’.

04:52:09.680 --> 04:52:15.440
In a question, especially a ‘WH’ question,
we start with the ‘WH’ word,

04:52:15.439 --> 04:52:16.718
and then the ‘be’ verb.

04:52:17.680 --> 04:52:21.039
‘are’ is the correct ‘be’ verb because
the subject is ‘you’.

04:52:21.920 --> 04:52:24.240
Then we have ‘going to’.

04:52:24.240 --> 04:52:27.199
And again, the base form of the verb.

04:52:27.840 --> 04:52:29.360
‘Why are you going to go?’

04:52:30.480 --> 04:52:33.519
Now try to find the mistake in the next sentence.

04:52:35.439 --> 04:52:37.839
‘You are going to studying at home.’

04:52:38.799 --> 04:52:40.080
Can you find the mistake?

04:52:41.359 --> 04:52:44.400
‘You are going to’ that's correct.

04:52:44.400 --> 04:52:46.798
But we need the base form of the verb.

04:52:48.000 --> 04:52:51.840
‘You are going to study at home.’

04:52:52.639 --> 04:52:55.360
‘You will be going to learn English.’

04:52:56.879 --> 04:52:58.320
‘You will be going’

04:52:59.600 --> 04:53:01.039
That sounds a little strange.

04:53:01.840 --> 04:53:04.401
Remember, we don't need the ‘will’ here.

04:53:04.400 --> 04:53:10.959
We're using ‘be going to’ and we need
to change the ‘be’ verb to match the subject.

04:53:12.080 --> 04:53:15.039
‘You are going to learn English’.

04:53:15.039 --> 04:53:20.320
Or remember, you can also say,
‘You will learn English.

04:53:20.320 --> 04:53:24.320
and finally
‘Is he going to do play soccer.’

04:53:25.119 --> 04:53:27.439
uh-oh
We have two verbs here.

04:53:28.000 --> 04:53:30.799
‘Is he going to’ - that's correct.

04:53:30.799 --> 04:53:33.279
But we have ‘do’ and ‘play’.

04:53:33.279 --> 04:53:38.638
We don't need both, so we say,
‘Is he going to play soccer?’

04:53:39.520 --> 04:53:40.879
Great job everybody.

04:53:40.879 --> 04:53:42.160
Let's move on.

04:53:42.160 --> 04:53:43.359
Great job, everyone.

04:53:43.359 --> 04:53:47.759
You now have a better understanding of the
future simple tense.

04:53:47.760 --> 04:53:52.719
There's still a lot of practice you need to
do because this tense is so important.

04:53:52.719 --> 04:54:01.840
Keep studying and I'll see you in the next
video.&nbsp;

04:54:03.680 --> 04:54:04.639
Hi, everybody.

04:54:04.639 --> 04:54:06.000
I'm Esther.

04:54:06.000 --> 04:54:10.719
In this video, I will introduce the future
continuous English grammar tense.

04:54:11.439 --> 04:54:15.839
This tense can be used to express an ongoing
action in the future.

04:54:16.561 --> 04:54:19.040
I'll go over the basics of this lesson.

04:54:19.039 --> 04:54:23.840
And by the end you'll have a better idea of
when to use this tense.

04:54:23.840 --> 04:54:26.000
There's a lot to learn, so let's get started.

04:54:29.439 --> 04:54:32.480
One usage of the future continuous tense

04:54:32.480 --> 04:54:36.718
is to talk about an ongoing action that will
happen in the future.

04:54:37.279 --> 04:54:40.080
We include when this action will be happening.

04:54:40.719 --> 04:54:44.561
We can use ‘will be’ or ‘be going to
be’.

04:54:44.561 --> 04:54:47.520
To do this, let's take a look at some examples.

04:54:48.480 --> 04:54:51.279
‘I will be taking the test soon.’

04:54:52.000 --> 04:54:56.240
So you can see here we have the subject and
then ‘will be’.

04:54:57.119 --> 04:54:59.840
After that, we include verb +ing.

04:55:00.719 --> 04:55:06.639
The word ‘soon’ at the end of this sentence
indicates when this action will be happening.

04:55:07.760 --> 04:55:11.840
‘I am going to be taking the test soon.’

04:55:11.840 --> 04:55:15.680
This sentence means the same thing as the
first sentence,

04:55:15.680 --> 04:55:19.360
but instead of ‘will be’, we used ‘be
going to be’.

04:55:20.080 --> 04:55:21.680
Here the subject is ‘I’.

04:55:22.320 --> 04:55:24.718
And therefore we have the ‘be’ verb ‘am’.

04:55:25.279 --> 04:55:29.679
‘I am going to be’
And then verb +ing.

04:55:30.400 --> 04:55:32.959
‘I am going to be taking the test soon.’

04:55:33.760 --> 04:55:36.401
I can also use the contraction and say.

04:55:36.400 --> 04:55:39.839
‘I'm going to be taking the test soon.’

04:55:40.400 --> 04:55:44.480
The next sentence says,
‘He will be sleeping by 10 p.m.’

04:55:45.439 --> 04:55:49.439
And the last sentence says,
‘They are going to be …’

04:55:49.439 --> 04:55:52.400
Here, because the subject is ‘they’, we
use ‘are’.

04:55:52.959 --> 04:55:56.879
‘They are going to be studying …’
There's the verb +ing

04:55:56.879 --> 04:55:58.639
‘… next October.’

04:55:59.600 --> 04:56:05.840
‘by 10 pm’ and ‘next October’ show
when these actions will be happening.

04:56:06.400 --> 04:56:07.920
Let's move on.

04:56:07.920 --> 04:56:11.600
The future continuous tense is also used to
show

04:56:11.600 --> 04:56:15.440
that a short action in the future is happening

04:56:15.439 --> 04:56:20.240
during or while a longer action is in progress
in the future,.

04:56:20.799 --> 04:56:25.279
We can use the word ‘when’
to show when the shorter action occurs.

04:56:25.920 --> 04:56:27.680
Take a look at the first example,

04:56:28.480 --> 04:56:31.119
‘I will be sleeping when they arrive.’

04:56:31.760 --> 04:56:33.920
Here we see two actions,

04:56:33.920 --> 04:56:36.959
‘I will be sleeping’ and ‘they arrive’.

04:56:38.080 --> 04:56:43.519
The part of the sentence that's in the future
continuous tense is the longer action

04:56:43.520 --> 04:56:45.520
that's in progress in the future.

04:56:46.160 --> 04:56:48.560
‘I will be sleeping.’

04:56:48.561 --> 04:56:52.081
Remember, ‘I will be’ and then verb +ing.

04:56:53.039 --> 04:56:56.480
This is the action that is ongoing in the
future.

04:56:57.279 --> 04:56:59.599
Then we see ‘when they arrive’.

04:57:00.240 --> 04:57:02.480
This is in the present tense.

04:57:02.480 --> 04:57:04.080
‘they arrive’

04:57:04.080 --> 04:57:09.840
This is the shorter action
that happens while this action is ongoing.

04:57:11.279 --> 04:57:14.560
‘We will be having dinner when the movie
starts.’

04:57:15.199 --> 04:57:17.840
This is very similar to the first sentence.

04:57:18.400 --> 04:57:20.480
‘We will be having dinner …’

04:57:20.480 --> 04:57:24.080
That's the ongoing action that will happen
in the future.

04:57:24.799 --> 04:57:28.959
And while this is happening,
the movie will start.

04:57:28.959 --> 04:57:31.680
But again, we use the present tense here.

04:57:31.680 --> 04:57:33.360
‘the movie starts’

04:57:33.359 --> 04:57:36.798
So we will be having dinner when the movie
starts.

04:57:38.160 --> 04:57:41.840
‘Tina is going to be working when you leave.’

04:57:41.840 --> 04:57:46.639
Remember, we can use ‘be going to be’
in this tense so,

04:57:47.359 --> 04:57:50.000
‘She is going to be working when you leave.’

04:57:50.561 --> 04:57:55.920
This shorter action will happen while this
ongoing action is in progress.

04:57:56.639 --> 04:58:00.719
And finally, ‘It will be raining when you
go shopping’.

04:58:01.279 --> 04:58:04.400
Again, this is the ongoing action.

04:58:04.400 --> 04:58:06.400
And this is the shorter action.

04:58:07.199 --> 04:58:08.480
Let's move on.

04:58:08.480 --> 04:58:12.878
Now, I'll talk about the negative form of
the future continuous tense.

04:58:13.439 --> 04:58:14.718
Here are some examples:

04:58:15.520 --> 04:58:18.241
‘He will not be reading before bed.’

04:58:19.039 --> 04:58:24.639
For the negative form, after the subject and
‘will’, we say ‘not be’.

04:58:24.639 --> 04:58:26.481
And then verb +ing.

04:58:27.359 --> 04:58:30.160
‘He will not be reading before bed.’

04:58:30.719 --> 04:58:32.160
He'll be doing something else.

04:58:33.279 --> 04:58:34.799
The next sentence says,

04:58:34.799 --> 04:58:38.160
‘My dad won't be cheering when the game
ends.’

04:58:38.799 --> 04:58:41.680
So this is very similar to the first sentence.

04:58:41.680 --> 04:58:43.760
We have the subject, ‘my dad,’

04:58:44.480 --> 04:58:48.000
and instead of ‘will not’ we use the contraction
‘won't’.

04:58:48.561 --> 04:58:52.000
Remember, ‘won't’ is a contraction for
‘will not’.

04:58:52.799 --> 04:58:57.440
‘My dad won't …’
and then we have ‘be’ verb +ing.

04:58:58.400 --> 04:59:01.439
‘My dad won't be cheering when the game
ends.’

04:59:02.480 --> 04:59:06.878
The next sentence says,
‘He is not going to be working tomorrow.’

04:59:07.680 --> 04:59:10.160
Here we have the ‘be going to be’.

04:59:10.959 --> 04:59:14.959
So ‘he’ is the subject and so we use the
‘be’ verb ‘is’.

04:59:15.920 --> 04:59:18.080
After the ‘be’ verb, we say ‘not’.

04:59:23.119 --> 04:59:24.617
He is not going to ‘be’ verb +ing.

04:59:24.617 --> 04:59:26.401
‘He is not going to be working tomorrow.’

04:59:27.199 --> 04:59:31.199
Remember, we can also use a contraction here
and say,

04:59:31.199 --> 04:59:34.560
‘He isn't going to be working tomorrow.’

04:59:34.561 --> 04:59:35.680
That's okay as well.

04:59:36.799 --> 04:59:39.760
‘We aren't going to be shopping on Sunday.’

04:59:40.561 --> 04:59:42.879
Here the subject is ‘we’.

04:59:42.879 --> 04:59:45.359
And so the ‘be’ verb to use is ‘are’.

04:59:46.320 --> 04:59:49.679
I use the contraction here ‘aren't’ for
‘are not’.

04:59:50.400 --> 04:59:55.759
‘We are not …’ or ‘We aren't going
to be shopping on Sunday.’

04:59:56.400 --> 04:59:57.279
Great job.

04:59:57.279 --> 04:59:58.560
Let's move on.

04:59:58.561 --> 05:00:04.161
Now let's talk about how to form basic questions
in the future continuous tense.

05:00:04.719 --> 05:00:07.039
Take a look at this first sentence.

05:00:07.039 --> 05:00:10.240
It says,
‘He will be traveling next month.’

05:00:10.959 --> 05:00:13.760
Now, to turn this into a question,

05:00:13.760 --> 05:00:18.000
all you have to do is change the order of
the first two words.

05:00:18.000 --> 05:00:20.879
So ‘He will’ becomes ‘Will he’.

05:00:21.760 --> 05:00:23.680
‘Will he be traveling next month?’

05:00:24.561 --> 05:00:27.840
You'll notice that the rest of the words don't
change.

05:00:28.400 --> 05:00:30.160
Only the first two words.

05:00:30.719 --> 05:00:34.080
So, ‘Will he be traveling next month?’

05:00:34.080 --> 05:00:37.279
To answer you can say,
‘Yes, he will.’

05:00:37.279 --> 05:00:38.879
or ‘No, he won't.’

05:00:39.920 --> 05:00:43.520
The next sentence says,
‘They are going to be living there.’

05:00:44.561 --> 05:00:50.481
Again to turn this into a question, simply
switch the order of the first two words.

05:00:51.199 --> 05:00:53.119
‘They are’ becomes ‘Are they’.

05:00:53.920 --> 05:00:55.920
‘Are they going to be living there?’

05:00:56.719 --> 05:01:00.080
To reply you can say,
‘Yes, they are.’

05:01:00.080 --> 05:01:01.840
or ‘No, they aren't.’

05:01:02.480 --> 05:01:05.679
Now, you'll notice in these two sentences,

05:01:05.680 --> 05:01:11.360
there is no exact point in time that shows
when this action will be happening in the

05:01:11.359 --> 05:01:12.320
future.

05:01:12.320 --> 05:01:16.240
There is no ‘next month’ or anything like
that.

05:01:16.240 --> 05:01:20.320
In that case, it simply means sometime in
the future.

05:01:20.320 --> 05:01:25.199
So, they are going to be living there sometime
in the future.

05:01:25.199 --> 05:01:26.240
That's what that means.

05:01:26.799 --> 05:01:28.080
Great job, everyone.

05:01:28.080 --> 05:01:29.279
Let's move on.

05:01:29.279 --> 05:01:34.959
Now, I'll go into how to form ‘WH’ questions
in the future continuous tense.

05:01:35.520 --> 05:01:36.799
Take a look at the board.

05:01:37.520 --> 05:01:42.879
First, you'll notice that all of these questions
begin with the ‘Wh’ words -

05:01:42.879 --> 05:01:46.080
‘Where,’ ‘What,’ ‘Who,’ and ‘When’.

05:01:46.879 --> 05:01:48.879
Let's take a look at the first question.

05:01:49.600 --> 05:01:51.680
‘Where will he be working?’

05:01:52.561 --> 05:01:56.799
When we use ‘will be’, we start with ‘Where’
and then ‘will’.

05:01:57.840 --> 05:02:02.000
After that, we have the subject + be and then
verb +ing.

05:02:03.039 --> 05:02:04.879
‘Where will he be working?’

05:02:05.760 --> 05:02:07.520
I can answer by saying,

05:02:07.520 --> 05:02:11.840
‘He will’ or ‘He'll be working at the
factory.’

05:02:12.480 --> 05:02:15.839
The next question says,
‘What will she be watching?’

05:02:16.719 --> 05:02:19.680
This is very similar to the first question.

05:02:19.680 --> 05:02:24.401
The only difference is that the subject is
now ‘she’ and the verb is different.

05:02:25.359 --> 05:02:26.798
‘What will she be watching?’

05:02:27.680 --> 05:02:33.280
I can say, ‘She'll be watching’ or ‘She
will be watching her favorite tv show’.

05:02:34.799 --> 05:02:36.561
‘Who will they be talking to?’

05:02:37.199 --> 05:02:39.760
Again, very similar.

05:02:39.760 --> 05:02:41.920
To answer,I can say,

05:02:41.920 --> 05:02:44.080
‘They will be talking to their mom.’

05:02:45.359 --> 05:02:48.160
The last question has ‘be going to be’.

05:02:48.959 --> 05:02:52.080
‘When are we …’ here the subject is
’we’.

05:02:52.080 --> 05:02:53.840
So we start with the ‘be verb’ – ‘are’.

05:02:54.639 --> 05:02:57.520
‘When are we going to be meeting Casey?’

05:02:58.320 --> 05:02:59.359
I can say,

05:02:59.359 --> 05:03:02.718
‘We are going to be meeting Casey
later tonight.’

05:03:03.600 --> 05:03:04.799
Good job, everybody.

05:03:04.799 --> 05:03:05.600
Let’s move on.

05:03:06.240 --> 05:03:09.840
Let's start a checkup for the future continuous
tense.

05:03:09.840 --> 05:03:12.080
Take a look at the first sentence.

05:03:12.080 --> 05:03:15.279
It says, ‘They _blank_ at school tomorrow.’

05:03:15.840 --> 05:03:20.160
I want you to use ‘will' and then the verb
‘study’, for this tense.

05:03:21.840 --> 05:03:24.639
Remember, in the future continuous
tense,

05:03:24.639 --> 05:03:29.680
no matter what the subject, we say ‘will
be’ and then verb +ing.

05:03:30.320 --> 05:03:35.840
So the correct answer for this sentence is
‘they will be studying’

05:03:37.439 --> 05:03:40.240
‘They will be studying at school tomorrow.’

05:03:41.039 --> 05:03:42.480
The next sentence says.

05:03:42.480 --> 05:03:45.439
‘Jesse _blank_ a TV show later.’

05:03:46.320 --> 05:03:50.480
Here, instead of ‘will’ try to use ‘be
going to be’.

05:03:52.561 --> 05:03:56.481
‘Jesse _blank_ watch a TV show later.’

05:03:56.480 --> 05:03:58.320
I want you to use the verb ‘watch’.

05:03:59.199 --> 05:04:03.359
So, Jessie is a ‘he’ or it can be a ‘she’.

05:04:03.359 --> 05:04:06.080
Sometimes the name is used for a boy or a
girl.

05:04:06.719 --> 05:04:09.119
Either way I need to use the ‘be’ verb
– ‘is’.

05:04:09.840 --> 05:04:14.160
‘Jesse is going to be’

05:04:15.920 --> 05:04:18.160
and then we need verb +ing.

05:04:19.600 --> 05:04:24.241
‘Jesse is going to be watching a TV show
later.’

05:04:25.359 --> 05:04:28.400
The next sentence, I want you to find the
mistake.

05:04:31.039 --> 05:04:34.400
‘We willn’t be studying at the library
today.’

05:04:36.480 --> 05:04:38.718
‘We will not …’

05:04:38.719 --> 05:04:41.199
What's the contraction for ‘will not’?

05:04:41.840 --> 05:04:44.481
Well it definitely isn't ‘willn’t’.

05:04:45.680 --> 05:04:48.080
The contraction is ‘won't’.

05:04:48.879 --> 05:04:52.080
‘We won't be studying at the library today.’

05:04:52.959 --> 05:04:57.600
And finally, ‘Sally and I will be meet our
friends soon.’

05:04:58.799 --> 05:05:02.799
Remember, we need ‘will be’ and then verb
+ing.

05:05:03.520 --> 05:05:05.280
So the correct answer is,

05:05:06.959 --> 05:05:10.080
‘Sally and I will be meeting our friends
soon.’

05:05:11.119 --> 05:05:12.240
Good job, everyone.

05:05:12.240 --> 05:05:14.000
Let's move on.

05:05:14.000 --> 05:05:19.039
Now, let's move on to the next checkup of
the future continuous tense.

05:05:19.039 --> 05:05:21.199
Take a look at the first sentence.

05:05:21.199 --> 05:05:25.359
It says, ‘He _blank_ at the door when the
movie ends.’

05:05:25.920 --> 05:05:29.119
I want you to use ‘will’ and the verb
‘wait’.

05:05:30.561 --> 05:05:35.920
Remember, for this tense, we need ‘will
be’ and then verb +ing,

05:05:36.639 --> 05:05:38.639
so the correct answer is,

05:05:38.639 --> 05:05:42.959
‘He will be waiting at the door when the
movie ends.’

05:05:44.160 --> 05:05:49.039
The next sentence says,
‘We are not …’ so this is a negative,

05:05:49.039 --> 05:05:51.760
‘_blank_ the play when he performs’.

05:05:52.400 --> 05:05:58.080
Here, instead of ‘will’, I want you to
use ‘be going to be’ and the verb ‘see’.

05:06:00.160 --> 05:06:03.039
We already have part of that phrase for you.

05:06:03.680 --> 05:06:06.799
‘We are …’, here's the ‘be’ verb,
‘not’

05:06:06.799 --> 05:06:08.320
so this is negative.

05:06:08.320 --> 05:06:12.080
And then we say ‘going to be’

05:06:13.279 --> 05:06:15.199
and then verb +ing.

05:06:17.199 --> 05:06:21.439
‘We are not going to be seeing the play
when he performs.’

05:06:22.400 --> 05:06:24.959
Now find the mistake in this sentence.

05:06:25.680 --> 05:06:30.000
‘They won't be stay at home when the delivery
man visits.’

05:06:31.359 --> 05:06:32.240
‘They won't be’

05:06:32.879 --> 05:06:35.039
That's correct in the negative form.

05:06:35.680 --> 05:06:39.039
However, we need verb +ing.

05:06:39.840 --> 05:06:43.600
‘They won't be staying at home when the
delivery man visits.’

05:06:44.561 --> 05:06:49.360
And finally, ‘Terry is going to working
when the manager arrives’.

05:06:50.480 --> 05:06:56.080
‘Terry’ is a ‘he’ or ‘she’ so
‘is’ is the correct ‘be’ verb to use.

05:06:56.879 --> 05:06:59.279
‘going to’ that's also correct.

05:06:59.920 --> 05:07:01.440
What we're missing here is ‘be’.

05:07:03.600 --> 05:07:07.360
‘Terry is going to be working when the manager
arrives.’

05:07:08.400 --> 05:07:09.679
Good job, everybody.

05:07:09.680 --> 05:07:10.481
Let's move on.

05:07:11.359 --> 05:07:15.839
Now, you have a better understanding of the
future continuous tense.

05:07:15.840 --> 05:07:20.639
Please take some time to study and practice
this tense as it is very important.

05:07:21.520 --> 05:07:25.360
I know English can be a struggle, but don't
worry, I'm here for you.

05:07:25.359 --> 05:07:26.798
And I believe in you.

05:07:26.799 --> 05:07:37.840
I'll see you in the next video.
Hi, everyone.

05:07:37.840 --> 05:07:39.039
I’m Esther.

05:07:39.039 --> 05:07:42.719
In this video, I will introduce the future
perfect tense.

05:07:43.279 --> 05:07:47.039
This tense is used to express an action in
the future

05:07:47.039 --> 05:07:50.080
that will happen by a specific time in the
future.

05:07:50.799 --> 05:07:56.561
This tense can be a little difficult to understand
but don't worry I will guide you through it

05:07:56.561 --> 05:07:57.440
so keep watching.

05:08:01.039 --> 05:08:06.000
The future perfect tense is used to express
an action in the future

05:08:06.000 --> 05:08:08.879
that will happen by a specific time in the
future.

05:08:09.520 --> 05:08:11.120
Let's look at some examples.

05:08:12.240 --> 05:08:13.920
The first sentence says,

05:08:13.920 --> 05:08:16.719
‘The snow will have stopped by April.’

05:08:17.680 --> 05:08:19.600
We start with the subject.

05:08:19.600 --> 05:08:21.280
In this case, ‘The snow’.

05:08:22.320 --> 05:08:27.599
Then, we follow with ‘will have’ and the
past participle of the verb.

05:08:28.160 --> 05:08:32.160
In this case, we used ‘stopped’ for the
verb ‘stop’.

05:08:33.199 --> 05:08:36.400
At the end of the sentence, you'll notice
‘by April’.

05:08:37.279 --> 05:08:43.840
‘by April’ shows the specific time in
the future when this action will have happened.

05:08:45.199 --> 05:08:46.799
The next sentence says,

05:08:46.799 --> 05:08:51.840
‘By the time he graduates, he will have
completed five years of study.’

05:08:52.879 --> 05:08:53.840
In this sentence,

05:08:54.400 --> 05:08:58.718
‘By the time he graduates’
or the specific time in the future.

05:08:58.719 --> 05:09:00.719
comes at the beginning of the sentence

05:09:01.279 --> 05:09:04.879
so ‘by’ plus ‘a time in the future’

05:09:04.879 --> 05:09:08.561
can come at the end
or it can come at the beginning.

05:09:09.279 --> 05:09:13.359
‘By the time he graduates, he will have
completed…’

05:09:14.000 --> 05:09:19.920
Again, you see ‘subject + will + have’
and the past participle of the verb.

05:09:19.920 --> 05:09:21.520
In this case, ‘completed’.

05:09:22.320 --> 05:09:27.679
‘By the time he graduates, he will have
completed five years of study.’

05:09:28.639 --> 05:09:30.241
The next sentence says,

05:09:30.240 --> 05:09:33.599
‘Her arm will have fully healed by the summer.’

05:09:34.400 --> 05:09:40.400
In this example, ‘by the summer’, the
future specific time, comes at the end.

05:09:41.359 --> 05:09:48.638
By this time in the future, her ‘arm’,
that's the subject, will have ‘healed’,

05:09:48.639 --> 05:09:50.000
the past participle.

05:09:50.561 --> 05:09:55.840
Here I put ‘fully’ just to show how much
it will have healed.

05:09:55.840 --> 05:09:58.160
I’m just adding an extra description.

05:09:59.199 --> 05:10:00.719
The last sentence says,

05:10:00.719 --> 05:10:05.600
‘By next month, …’ so here we see ‘by’
and ‘the time’ at the beginning of the

05:10:05.600 --> 05:10:06.080
sentence.

05:10:06.959 --> 05:10:09.039
‘you’, that's the subject.

05:10:09.039 --> 05:10:12.480
‘will have received’, there's the past
participle.

05:10:12.480 --> 05:10:13.359
‘your promotion.’

05:10:14.240 --> 05:10:19.039
Again, ‘By next month you will have received
your promotion.’

05:10:19.920 --> 05:10:20.719
Let's move on.

05:10:21.600 --> 05:10:26.080
Now, let's talk about the negative form of
the future perfect tense.

05:10:26.639 --> 05:10:28.080
Here are some examples.

05:10:28.719 --> 05:10:29.520
Let's take a look.

05:10:30.240 --> 05:10:31.840
The first sentence says,

05:10:31.840 --> 05:10:35.840
‘I will not have graduated from university
by July.’

05:10:36.879 --> 05:10:42.481
First, I want to point out that at the end,
I have the specific time in the future,

05:10:43.119 --> 05:10:44.000
‘byJuly’.

05:10:44.799 --> 05:10:51.119
Now for the negative form, what I do is say,
‘subject’ and ‘will not have’,

05:10:52.080 --> 05:10:55.039
then we put the past participle of the verb.

05:10:55.760 --> 05:11:00.799
‘I will not have graduated from university
by July.’

05:11:02.000 --> 05:11:03.760
The next sentence says,

05:11:03.760 --> 05:11:07.600
‘Ollie and Max will not have spoken ...’

05:11:07.600 --> 05:11:13.440
There it is again, ‘will not have’ and
then the past participle of speak ...

05:11:13.439 --> 05:11:14.759
which is ‘spoken’.

05:11:14.760 --> 05:11:18.000
‘… before the plane leaves.’

05:11:18.000 --> 05:11:24.080
Here, instead of the word ‘by’, we used
‘before’ to show a specific time in the

05:11:24.080 --> 05:11:24.959
future.

05:11:24.959 --> 05:11:26.160
That's okay as well.

05:11:27.279 --> 05:11:28.959
The next sentence says,

05:11:28.959 --> 05:11:32.000
‘You will not have eaten dinner by 6 p.m.’

05:11:32.879 --> 05:11:37.920
Here, again, we've used ‘by 6 p.m.’ to
show a time in the future.

05:11:38.561 --> 05:11:45.040
And again, you see ‘you will not have’
and then the past participle of eat which

05:11:45.039 --> 05:11:45.840
is ‘eaten’.

05:11:46.959 --> 05:11:50.799
The last sentence says,
‘By noon …’, there's the time again,

05:11:51.439 --> 05:11:54.878
‘I will not have taken off to Japan.’

05:11:55.840 --> 05:11:59.920
‘taken’ is the past participle of ‘take’.

05:11:59.920 --> 05:12:00.719
Let's move on.

05:12:01.279 --> 05:12:06.160
Now, let's move on to how to form questions
in the future perfect tense.

05:12:06.959 --> 05:12:08.561
The first sentence here says,

05:12:09.119 --> 05:12:12.000
‘You will have gone to work by 10 a.m.’

05:12:12.959 --> 05:12:15.840
To turn this into a question, all we have
to

05:12:15.840 --> 05:12:18.799
do is switch the order of the first two words.

05:12:19.760 --> 05:12:22.080
‘You will’ becomes ‘Will you’.

05:12:22.879 --> 05:12:28.320
You'll notice that the rest of the question
stays the same as the sentence.

05:12:28.320 --> 05:12:31.039
‘Will you have gone to work by 10 a.m.?’

05:12:31.920 --> 05:12:35.440
You can answer by saying,
‘Yes, I will have.’

05:12:35.439 --> 05:12:37.679
or ‘No, I will have not.’

05:12:38.799 --> 05:12:42.799
The next sentence says,
‘She will have woken up by noon.’

05:12:43.760 --> 05:12:48.481
Again, to turn this into a question just switch
the first two words.

05:12:49.039 --> 05:12:51.439
‘She will’ becomes ‘Will she’.

05:12:52.320 --> 05:12:54.400
‘Will she have woken up by noon?’

05:12:55.199 --> 05:12:58.560
Again, the rest of the sentence stays the
same.

05:12:59.760 --> 05:13:01.840
‘Will she have woken up by noon?’

05:13:02.879 --> 05:13:06.799
To reply, you can say,
‘Yes, she will have.’

05:13:06.799 --> 05:13:10.000
or ‘No, she will have not.’

05:13:10.000 --> 05:13:10.799
Let's move on.

05:13:11.840 --> 05:13:16.959
Now, I'll talk about how to form ‘WH’
questions in the future perfect tense.

05:13:17.680 --> 05:13:23.039
If you notice on the board, each of these
questions begins with the ‘WH’ word.

05:13:23.600 --> 05:13:26.879
‘Where’, ‘what’, ‘who’, and ‘when’.

05:13:28.080 --> 05:13:31.760
Then after each ‘WH’ word comes the word
‘will’.

05:13:32.480 --> 05:13:34.560
‘Where will’
‘What will’

05:13:34.561 --> 05:13:36.321
‘Who will’
and ‘When will’

05:13:36.959 --> 05:13:39.439
So let's take a look at the first question.

05:13:40.160 --> 05:13:43.840
‘Where will’…’ then you add ‘the
subject’.

05:13:43.840 --> 05:13:45.119
In this case, ‘you’.

05:13:46.000 --> 05:13:51.520
And then, ‘have’ and after that the past
participle of the verb.

05:13:51.520 --> 05:13:53.280
In this case, it's ‘traveled’.

05:13:54.000 --> 05:13:57.039
‘Where will you have traveled by December?’

05:13:57.680 --> 05:14:02.719
I can answer by saying,
‘I will have traveled to Germany and Denmark.’

05:14:02.719 --> 05:14:05.840
There are many possible answers here and this
is just an example.

05:14:07.119 --> 05:14:11.359
The next question says,
‘What will they have done …’

05:14:11.359 --> 05:14:13.759
‘done’ is the past participle of ‘do’.

05:14:13.760 --> 05:14:16.240
‘… by the end of the evening?’

05:14:16.959 --> 05:14:20.400
I can answer by saying,
‘They will have done their homework.’

05:14:21.680 --> 05:14:26.401
The next question says,
‘Who will she have interviewed by 5 p.m.?’

05:14:27.359 --> 05:14:34.240
Again, ‘who will’ + the subject ‘have’
and the past participle of the verb.

05:14:34.240 --> 05:14:36.638
I can answer this question by saying,

05:14:36.639 --> 05:14:39.760
‘She will have interviewed the teachers
by 5 p.m.’

05:14:40.799 --> 05:14:43.920
And finally, ‘When will they have started
to learn?’

05:14:44.959 --> 05:14:47.760
One way to answer this question is to say,

05:14:47.760 --> 05:14:50.639
‘They will have started to learn in January.’

05:14:51.439 --> 05:14:52.240
Let's move on.

05:14:53.199 --> 05:14:56.320
Let's start this checkup for the future perfect
tense.

05:14:56.879 --> 05:14:59.199
Take a look at the first sentence.

05:14:59.199 --> 05:15:03.199
It says,
‘We _blank_ that book by tomorrow.’

05:15:03.840 --> 05:15:06.000
The verb to use is ‘read’.

05:15:07.600 --> 05:15:11.760
Remember, in the future perfect tense, we
start with the subject,

05:15:11.760 --> 05:15:13.440
and we have that here, ‘we’.

05:15:14.480 --> 05:15:19.199
Then say, ‘will have’ and the past
participle of the verb.

05:15:19.840 --> 05:15:22.481
So here we need to say ‘will have’.

05:15:23.600 --> 05:15:26.639
What is the past participle of ‘read’?

05:15:27.600 --> 05:15:29.840
The correct answer is ‘read’.

05:15:32.080 --> 05:15:35.359
They're spelled the same, but they are pronounced
differently.

05:15:36.160 --> 05:15:39.519
‘We will have read that book by tomorrow.’

05:15:40.639 --> 05:15:45.440
The next sentence says,
‘She _blank_ the video by bedtime.’

05:15:46.160 --> 05:15:50.719
Here we have ‘not’ so I want you to try
the negative form.

05:15:50.719 --> 05:15:52.799
And the verb to try is ‘watch’.

05:15:55.920 --> 05:15:58.719
In the negative form, we start with the subject.

05:15:58.719 --> 05:16:02.160
And instead of ‘will have’, we say ‘will
not have’.

05:16:03.439 --> 05:16:10.240
‘She will not have …’
Then we need the past participle of the verb.

05:16:11.039 --> 05:16:13.519
In this case, it is ‘watched’.

05:16:14.480 --> 05:16:18.160
‘She will not have watched the video by
bedtime.’

05:16:19.199 --> 05:16:22.000
Now find the mistake in the next sentence.

05:16:24.400 --> 05:16:28.240
‘Ryan will not have be to Cuba by summer.’

05:16:29.279 --> 05:16:32.718
This is the negative form because we have
‘will not have’.

05:16:33.520 --> 05:16:34.639
That's correct.

05:16:34.639 --> 05:16:37.680
But we need the past participle of ‘be’.

05:16:38.799 --> 05:16:41.199
So we need to change it to ‘been’.

05:16:42.240 --> 05:16:45.840
‘Ryan will not have been to Cuba by summer.’

05:16:46.879 --> 05:16:52.000
The last sentence says,
‘I will have go to school by 8 30 a.m.’

05:16:53.039 --> 05:16:55.920
Here, we have the affirmative, ‘will have’.

05:16:56.561 --> 05:17:02.959
But, uh oh, we forgot the past participle
of ‘go’ which is ‘gone’.

05:17:04.000 --> 05:17:07.439
‘I will have gone to school by 8 30 a.m.’

05:17:08.480 --> 05:17:09.839
Great job, everybody.

05:17:09.840 --> 05:17:10.639
Let's move on.

05:17:11.279 --> 05:17:12.480
Good job, guys.

05:17:12.480 --> 05:17:16.718
Now you have a better understanding of the
future perfect tense.

05:17:16.719 --> 05:17:19.840
I want you to keep studying and practicing
this tense.

05:17:20.480 --> 05:17:24.240
I know studying English can be difficult,
but I believe in you

05:17:24.240 --> 05:17:25.679
and I will guide you through it.

05:17:26.320 --> 05:17:37.840
I'll see you in the next video.
Hi, everybody.

05:17:37.840 --> 05:17:39.039
I’m Esther.

05:17:39.039 --> 05:17:41.279
Welcome to the last tense.

05:17:41.279 --> 05:17:45.039
If you haven't checked out my earlier videos
on the tenses,

05:17:45.039 --> 05:17:46.400
please go check them out now.

05:17:47.279 --> 05:17:51.679
In this video, I will talk about the future
perfect continuous tense.

05:17:52.480 --> 05:17:56.160
This tense can be used to describe an ongoing
action

05:17:56.160 --> 05:18:01.439
or situation that will last for a specified
period of time in the future.

05:18:02.000 --> 05:18:04.240
There's a lot to learn, so keep watching.

05:18:08.240 --> 05:18:14.160
The future perfect continuous tense is used
to talk about an ongoing situation

05:18:14.160 --> 05:18:20.560
that will be in progress for a period of time
at a specific point in time in the future.

05:18:21.279 --> 05:18:23.119
Let's take a look at some examples.

05:18:23.840 --> 05:18:25.520
The first sentence says,

05:18:25.520 --> 05:18:30.081
‘She will have been living in Ireland for
10 years at that point.’

05:18:30.959 --> 05:18:34.639
So no matter what the subject, in this case
we have ‘she’,

05:18:35.279 --> 05:18:39.439
we follow with ‘will have been’ and then
‘verb +ing’.

05:18:40.000 --> 05:18:44.719
So, ‘She will have been living in Ireland
…’

05:18:44.719 --> 05:18:47.440
Then this sentence has the duration.

05:18:48.080 --> 05:18:52.400
What period of time will this last?
‘for 10 years’

05:18:53.039 --> 05:18:53.920
And when?

05:18:54.480 --> 05:18:57.519
Remember, we need a point in time in the future.

05:18:58.160 --> 05:19:03.039
In this case, we just use a general expression,
‘at that point’.

05:19:03.600 --> 05:19:06.080
Here, it's not specific and that's okay.

05:19:06.639 --> 05:19:09.680
We'll see some specific examples in the next
sentence.

05:19:10.719 --> 05:19:15.039
‘By midnight, he will have been sleeping
for four hours.’

05:19:15.840 --> 05:19:20.719
Here, the specific time in the future comes
at the beginning of the sentence.

05:19:21.279 --> 05:19:26.000
‘By midnight’
And, again, we see ‘will have been’ +

05:19:26.000 --> 05:19:26.879
verb 'ing'.

05:19:27.760 --> 05:19:31.440
‘By midnight, he will have been sleeping
for four hours.’.

05:19:31.439 --> 05:19:33.439
Here we have ‘for four hours’.

05:19:34.000 --> 05:19:39.199
This shows the duration or how long this action
will be in progress.

05:19:40.000 --> 05:19:44.799
So, again, ‘By midnight he will have been
sleeping for four hours.’

05:19:45.680 --> 05:19:48.401
The last sentence says, ‘In June …’

05:19:48.400 --> 05:19:54.320
Here, again, we have the specific time in
the future at the beginning of the sentence.

05:19:55.119 --> 05:19:58.320
‘In June, ‘we’ that's the subject.

05:19:58.320 --> 05:20:01.920
‘we'll have been studying …’
There's the ‘verb +ing’.

05:20:01.920 --> 05:20:04.959
‘… at this university for four years.’

05:20:05.520 --> 05:20:08.321
Here is the duration, ‘for four years’.

05:20:09.119 --> 05:20:09.760
Good job.

05:20:09.760 --> 05:20:10.639
And let's move on.

05:20:11.199 --> 05:20:16.320
Now, let's look at the negative form of the
future perfect continuous tense.

05:20:17.039 --> 05:20:24.080
In the affirmative form, we say ‘subject’
+ ‘will have been’ and then ‘verb +ing’.

05:20:24.080 --> 05:20:29.600
In the negative form, however, we say, ‘subject’
+ ‘will not have been’

05:20:29.600 --> 05:20:30.959
and then ‘verb +ing’.

05:20:31.680 --> 05:20:33.520
Let's take a look at some examples.

05:20:34.400 --> 05:20:35.920
The first sentence here says,

05:20:36.480 --> 05:20:41.119
‘At that point, I will not have been living
in Spain for 10 years.’

05:20:41.840 --> 05:20:42.799
And so you see it.

05:20:43.520 --> 05:20:44.879
‘I’ is the subject.

05:20:44.879 --> 05:20:49.279
‘… will not have been’
and then ‘verb +ing’.

05:20:49.840 --> 05:20:51.840
In this case, ‘living’.

05:20:52.400 --> 05:20:53.519
The next sentence says,

05:20:54.080 --> 05:20:57.920
‘He will not have been sleeping for four
hours by midnight.’

05:20:58.559 --> 05:21:04.080
Again, we see the ‘subject’ + ‘will
not have been’ and then ‘verb +ing’,

05:21:04.719 --> 05:21:06.321
‘sleeping’.

05:21:06.320 --> 05:21:08.080
The last sentence says,

05:21:08.080 --> 05:21:13.359
‘By then, we will not have been studying
at this university for three years.’

05:21:14.160 --> 05:21:20.558
Again, we see the ‘subject’ + ‘we will
not have been’ and then ‘verb +ing’

05:21:20.559 --> 05:21:21.760
here, ‘studying’.

05:21:22.480 --> 05:21:23.199
Let's move on.

05:21:24.000 --> 05:21:29.520
Now let's take a look at how to form questions
in the future perfect continuous tense.

05:21:30.320 --> 05:21:32.240
Here, the sentence says,

05:21:32.240 --> 05:21:36.240
‘Sean will have been playing soccer for
a year by December.’

05:21:36.959 --> 05:21:42.160
To turn this into a question, all we have
to do is switch the order of the first two

05:21:42.160 --> 05:21:43.039
words.

05:21:43.039 --> 05:21:46.959
So instead of ‘Sean will’, I can say ‘Will
Sean’.

05:21:47.680 --> 05:21:51.440
‘Will Sean have been playing soccer for
a year by December?’

05:21:52.080 --> 05:21:55.600
You'll notice that the rest of the sentence
stays the same.

05:21:56.480 --> 05:22:00.320
I can answer by saying,
‘Yes, he will have.’

05:22:00.320 --> 05:22:02.799
or ‘No, he will have not.’

05:22:03.680 --> 05:22:05.280
The next sentence says,

05:22:05.279 --> 05:22:09.119
‘They will have been working there for three
months by that time.’

05:22:10.000 --> 05:22:13.359
Again, I changed the order of the first two
words.

05:22:13.359 --> 05:22:17.920
To turn this into a question ‘They will’
becomes ‘Will they’.

05:22:18.799 --> 05:22:22.481
‘Will they have been working there for three
months by that time?’

05:22:23.359 --> 05:22:26.480
Again, the rest of the sentence stays the
same.

05:22:28.240 --> 05:22:31.920
I can answer by saying,
‘Yes, they will have.’

05:22:31.920 --> 05:22:34.400
or ‘No, they will have not.’

05:22:35.119 --> 05:22:36.400
Let's move on.

05:22:36.400 --> 05:22:42.160
Now let's take a look at how to form ‘WH”
questions in the future perfect continuous

05:22:42.160 --> 05:22:42.480
tense.

05:22:43.119 --> 05:22:44.480
Take a look at the board.

05:22:45.199 --> 05:22:48.480
All of these questions begin with a ‘WH’
word.

05:22:49.039 --> 05:22:50.559
‘where’
‘what’

05:22:51.359 --> 05:22:53.119
‘who’ and
‘how long’

05:22:54.000 --> 05:22:55.760
Take a look at the first question.

05:22:56.719 --> 05:22:58.719
‘Where will you have been walking?’

05:22:59.680 --> 05:23:05.360
To form a ‘WH’ question, we start with
the ‘WH’ word, then ‘will’.

05:23:06.879 --> 05:23:11.840
After that, we add the subject, ‘you’,
‘they’, ‘she’ and ‘you’.

05:23:12.400 --> 05:23:16.400
After that, we add ‘have been’ + ‘verb
+ing’.

05:23:17.600 --> 05:23:19.760
‘Where will you have been walking?’

05:23:21.199 --> 05:23:23.119
‘What will they have been playing?’

05:23:24.719 --> 05:23:27.039
‘Who will she have been talking to?’

05:23:27.840 --> 05:23:31.680
and ‘How long will you have been working
…?’

05:23:31.680 --> 05:23:32.959
There's the ‘verb +ing’.

05:23:32.959 --> 05:23:35.199
‘ … there by the time you finish?’

05:23:36.240 --> 05:23:41.119
So let's go through one more time and I'll
show you how to answer these questions.

05:23:42.400 --> 05:23:44.320
‘Where will you have been walking?’

05:23:44.959 --> 05:23:49.119
I can answer by saying,
‘I will have been walking in the park.’

05:23:50.480 --> 05:23:52.240
‘What will they have been playing?’

05:23:53.359 --> 05:23:55.759
‘They will have been playing video games.’

05:23:57.279 --> 05:23:59.439
‘Who will she have been talking to?’

05:24:00.480 --> 05:24:02.878
‘She will have been talking to her cousin.’

05:24:03.840 --> 05:24:05.039
And finally,

05:24:05.039 --> 05:24:09.039
‘How long will you have been
working there by the time you finish?’

05:24:10.000 --> 05:24:14.719
‘By the time I finish, I will have been
working there for five years.’

05:24:15.520 --> 05:24:16.799
Let's move on.

05:24:16.799 --> 05:24:20.401
Let's start a checkup for the future perfect
continuous tense.

05:24:20.959 --> 05:24:22.240
Take a look at the board.

05:24:22.879 --> 05:24:24.400
The first sentence says,

05:24:24.400 --> 05:24:29.199
‘By 10 p.m., I _blank_ that game for three
hours.’

05:24:29.760 --> 05:24:31.840
I’m looking to use the verb ‘play’.

05:24:34.000 --> 05:24:40.879
Remember, in this tense, we need to have ‘subject’
+ ‘will have been’ and then ‘verb +ing’.

05:24:41.600 --> 05:24:47.840
So ‘By 10 p.m., I will have been playing
…’

05:24:47.840 --> 05:24:49.840
Again, we need ‘verb +ing’.

05:24:49.840 --> 05:24:53.360
‘… I will have been playing that game
for three hours.

05:24:54.160 --> 05:24:55.920
The next sentence says,

05:24:55.920 --> 05:25:00.000
‘When she gets here, he _blank_ dinner for
an hour.’

05:25:00.799 --> 05:25:04.240
Try to use the verb ‘cook’.

05:25:04.240 --> 05:25:08.240
Again, no matter what the subject, it doesn't
change.

05:25:08.799 --> 05:25:18.320
‘When she gets here, he will have been cooking
…’

05:25:18.320 --> 05:25:22.718
‘When she gets here, he will have been cooking
dinner for an hour.’

05:25:23.600 --> 05:25:26.481
Now, find the mistake in the next sentence.

05:25:29.359 --> 05:25:34.638
‘Steve and Jan will not have be waiting
for a year when it arrives.’

05:25:35.840 --> 05:25:40.000
Here, we have a negative form, ‘they will
not have’.

05:25:40.959 --> 05:25:43.039
Then we need ‘been’.

05:25:44.320 --> 05:25:47.119
‘They will not have been …’

05:25:47.119 --> 05:25:50.639
And then the ‘verb +ing’ is here so that's
correct.

05:25:51.439 --> 05:25:56.000
‘Steve and Jan will not have been waiting
for a year when it arrives.’

05:25:56.959 --> 05:25:58.160
The last sentence says,

05:25:58.719 --> 05:26:03.119
‘It will have been work for 10 years on
January 15th.’

05:26:03.760 --> 05:26:07.840
So maybe here I’m talking about a computer
or a TV.

05:26:07.840 --> 05:26:09.680
Maybe some kind of machine.

05:26:09.680 --> 05:26:12.959
‘it’
‘It will have been …’

05:26:12.959 --> 05:26:14.240
I see the mistake here.

05:26:14.799 --> 05:26:16.799
We need ‘verb +ing’.

05:26:19.039 --> 05:26:24.000
‘It will have been working for 10 years
on January 15th.

05:26:24.879 --> 05:26:26.240
Great job, everybody.

05:26:26.240 --> 05:26:27.039
Let's move on.

05:26:27.600 --> 05:26:32.080
Thank you so much for watching this&nbsp;
course on the twelve English tenses.&nbsp;

05:26:32.080 --> 05:26:36.080
Now, you have a better understanding&nbsp;
of how to use these tenses.&nbsp;

05:26:36.639 --> 05:26:42.160
I know studying English can be hard, but&nbsp;
with time and practice, you will get better.&nbsp;

05:26:42.799 --> 05:26:46.000
Please watch my other videos.
And I’ll see you next time.&nbsp;

05:26:46.000 --> 05:26:55.840
Bye.
