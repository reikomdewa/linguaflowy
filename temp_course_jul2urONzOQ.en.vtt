00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.310
Hi, I’m Olivier.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.700
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.500
In this lesson, you can learn about sentence
structure in English.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.360
You’ll learn how to construct all kinds
of sentences in English, from the simplest

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.020
possible sentences, to long, complex sentences
which contain many different ideas.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.800
To begin, a question:

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.350
What’s the simplest sentence you can make
in English?

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.920
What does every sentence in English need?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.560
Every sentence needs a verb.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.370
The simplest sentence is an imperative, which
means when you tell someone to do something.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.080
For example:

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.320
Run!

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.740
Leave!

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.000
Work!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.840
These are the simplest complete sentences
you can make in English; they’re just one

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.260
word long!

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.180
Of course, most sentences are longer than
this.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.890
Most sentences that are longer than one word
also need a noun before the verb.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
This noun is the subject.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.570
With a subject plus a verb, you can make simple
sentences like:

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.600
He runs.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.020
She left.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.610
They’re working.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.060
You can see that the verb can be in different
forms: past or present, simple or continuous.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.490
The verb form doesn’t change the structure
of the sentence.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.280
These are all the same: subject plus verb.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.710
Of course, these sentences aren’t very interesting.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.369
You can’t say much with short sentences
like these.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.430
Let’s add a little more information.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.500
Take the sentence he runs.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.770
What could you add after runs to make it longer?

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.780
You could add an adverb of place:

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.320
He runs around the park.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.670
You could add an adverb of time:

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.170
He runs every morning.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.340
You could add both:

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.420
He runs around the park every morning.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.580
You could add an adverb of manner:

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.540
He runs slowly.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.620
You can see that you have many choices, but
your choices are also limited.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.730
In this case, you can use different kinds
of adverbs, but there are also things you

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.650
can’t use.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.200
For example, you can’t use another verb
after run, you can’t use an adjective, and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.880
you can’t use a noun, or at least you can’t
use a noun with this meaning of run.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.620
This is an important point, so let’s look
at it in more detail.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.300
To build grammatically complete sentences
in English, there’s one important question:

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.150
what needs to come next?

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.020
For example, you saw the sentence he runs.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.200
That’s a complete sentence.

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.920
You can put a full stop after runs, and it’s
correct.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.260
It’s very basic, but it’s correct.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.750
What about these:

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.680
She likes
He wants

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.540
We go

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.930
These aren’t complete sentences.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.440
Can you explain why not?

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.980
They aren’t complete, very simply, because
they aren’t finished.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.470
Look at the first sentence: She likes.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.470
She likes…what?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.290
She has to like something.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.569
He wants…

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.260
What does he want?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.500
You can’t just ‘want’, you have to want
something.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.040
We go…

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.840
Where?

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.520
At this point, we want to teach you a word:
complement.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.370
The complement is the thing you add after
a verb to make a sentence complete.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.799
A complement can have many different forms.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.410
It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective or
an adverb.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.639
These things can be single words or phrases.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.180
For example, when we say ‘noun’, we also
mean noun phrases.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:45.580
So, table is a noun, and the wooden table
which my grandmother gave me is also a noun.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.710
Both nouns refer to one object—one table.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.040
For this lesson, a noun can be one word, or
a phrase.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.770
Okay, let’s practice.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.240
Look at the first sentence: she likes.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.500
How could you finish this?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.870
What are the possible complements?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.900
Pause the video and write down three endings
for your sentence.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.229
Try to use different ideas and structures.

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.380
Ready?

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.920
Let’s look at some possible answers.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.560
These are just our suggestions; of course
there are many possibilities!

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.410
She likes strawberries.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.240
She likes swimming.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.630
She likes getting up before the sun rises.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.310
She likes to listen to music while she works.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:46.000
You can see that there’s more than one possible
complement: you can use a noun, a gerund (a

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.280
verb with -ing which acts like a noun), a
gerund phrase, or an infinitive verb with

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.960
‘to’.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.889
So, you have many choices!

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.240
However, like before, your choices are also
limited.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.949
Only certain structures are possible.

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:08.130
The idea of complements isn’t just for the
first verb in the sentence.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.590
Many words need a complement.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.539
For example, look at one of the sentences
you just saw:

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.639
She likes getting up before the sun rises.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.170
Technically, you can say She likes getting
up.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.960
It’s a grammatically complete sentence,
but you’d never say it.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.639
Why not?

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.380
Because it doesn’t make any sense.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.919
You need more information.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.990
She likes getting up… when?

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.620
Why?

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.250
How?

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.180
You need a complement after getting up to
complete the idea.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.000
She likes getting up before…

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.830
Before also needs a complement.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.680
You can’t stop there.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.990
Before what?

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.270
She likes getting up before the sun….

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.319
This also doesn’t work, because it doesn’t
make sense.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:15.169
It doesn’t make sense because the sun needs
a complement.

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.069
Before the sun does what?

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.320
She likes getting up before the sun rises.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.780
Ok, finally we have a sentence which is both
grammatically complete and which communicates

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.360
meaning.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.080
What should you remember from this?

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.069
Remember that when you use a particular word,
you have limited choices in what kind of word

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:40.960
you use next.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:49.660
To speak or write in clear, correct English,
you don’t just need to know English words.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.800
You need to know what can come next.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:01.500
For example, with a verb like like or want,
it’s not enough to know the verb.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:08.490
You also need to know whether the verb needs
a complement, and what complements are—or

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.160
aren’t—possible.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.430
This is why it’s good to learn vocabulary
in full phrases and sentences.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:23.349
That way, you’ll know how to use the words
you learn to make sentences you can use in

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:28.220
your spoken or written English.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:34.750
Using what you’ve seen up to now, you can
build many simple English sentences.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:44.180
Let’s see how you can add more information
and more detail to these simple sentences.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:52.420
You can add information to a simple sentence
in two ways: you can add adjectives or adverbs.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:58.580
Let’s look at an example, using a sentence
we started before, but we didn’t finish:

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.940
He wants…

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.959
Actually, you should do some work!

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:08.410
Pause the video, and finish this sentence
in three different ways.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.320
Start again when you have your answers.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.820
Ready?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.480
Here’s our suggestion:

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:18.329
He wants to buy a car.

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:24.579
Now, let’s add some description using adjectives
and adverbs.

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:29.970
Can you see how you could add adjectives to
this sentence?

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:35.360
You could add adjectives before the word car,
like this:

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.100
He wants to buy a new car.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.310
He wants to buy a second-hand car.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:48.970
He wants to buy a bright red car.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.009
What about adverbs?

00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:55.690
Could you add adverbs to these sentences to
add some details?

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.829
There are many possibilities; for example:

00:09:59.829 --> 00:10:03.509
Apparently, he wants to buy a new car.

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:06.529
He wants to buy a second-hand car next month.

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:12.199
He wants to buy a bright red car for his new
girlfriend.

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:17.579
You can see that adverbs can be single words
or phrases.

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:22.850
Adjectives can go before the noun they describe,
or after some verbs.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:27.579
Adverbs are more complicated, and can go in
many different positions.

00:10:27.579 --> 00:10:34.569
However, this is the important point: using
adjectives and adverbs like this doesn’t

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:38.959
change whether a sentence is complete or not.

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.249
If you say:

00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:41.860
He wants to buy a car.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.809
That’s a complete sentence.

00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:50.110
You can add adjectives and adverbs to it to
make it more detailed:

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:55.980
Apparently, he wants to buy a second-hand
car for his new girlfriend.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:03.379
However, if a sentence is incomplete, then
you can’t make it complete by adding adjectives

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:04.499
or adverbs:

00:11:04.499 --> 00:11:07.939
He wants to buy…

00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:10.559
This sentence is incomplete.

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:14.059
Adding adjectives and adverbs won’t make
it complete.

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:19.610
So, at this point, you can build a simple
sentence.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:25.720
You also hopefully understand something about
complements and why they’re important for

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.980
making complete sentences, and now you can
also add description to a complete sentence

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.320
using adjectives and adverbs.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.280
Let’s see how you can combine these
simple sentences into complex ones.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.040
First, let’s define some words.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:56.139
A conjunction is something which joins two
sentences or two parts of a sentence together.

00:11:56.139 --> 00:12:06.009
Words like and, but, if, although, because
or which are conjunctions.

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:12.689
A complex sentence contains two or more parts
joined with a conjunction.

00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:16.119
These parts are called clauses.

00:12:16.119 --> 00:12:24.350
An independent clause expresses a complete
idea, and could stand by itself.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:29.869
A dependent clause would not make sense if
it were by itself.

00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:38.259
A dependent clause depends on an independent
clause in the same sentence in order to have

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:39.259
meaning.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:44.939
Don’t worry if this is new—you don’t
need to remember everything right now.

00:12:44.939 --> 00:12:52.490
You’ll see lots of examples of these ideas
in this section and the next section, too.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:58.700
In this section, you’re going to learn about
complex sentences with two independent clauses.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.140
Okay, enough abstract talk!

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.000
Let’s see some examples:

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.520
He runs around the park every morning, so
he’s in pretty good shape.

00:13:09.529 --> 00:13:14.079
She likes strawberries, but she hardly ever
eats them.

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:18.620
You should write to her and thank her for
the present.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.470
These are simple examples of complex sentences.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:32.509
Here’s your recipe: independent clause +
conjunction + independent clause.

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:38.460
You generally need a comma at the end of the
first clause, before the conjunction, but

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:46.189
comma rules are quite flexible in English,
so you won’t always need a comma.

00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:48.739
Look at the first example:

00:13:48.739 --> 00:13:55.929
He runs around the park every morning, so
he’s in pretty good shape.

00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:59.820
Which word is the conjunction?

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.880
The conjunction is so.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:08.340
You can split this sentence into two full,
meaningful sentences:

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.939
Let’s look at one more:

00:14:11.939 --> 00:14:17.509
She likes strawberries, but she hardly ever
eats them.

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:24.160
Again, you can split this into two full sentences.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.460
You might think that the second sentence

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.080
here isn’t complete or doesn’t make sense by itself.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.660
As it is, you’d be right.

00:14:33.669 --> 00:14:40.629
However, you can change them to strawberries,
and then it’s a complete, meaningful sentence:

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:45.199
But, she hardly ever eats strawberries.

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:51.149
You can keep adding conjunctions and clauses
for as long as you want:

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:57.669
She likes strawberries, but she hardly ever
eats them, and she doesn’t earn much money,

00:14:57.669 --> 00:15:04.009
so she has to be careful how much she spends
on groceries, and fresh food is generally

00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:10.880
more expensive than canned or frozen produce,
so…

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.249
Of course, just because you can, it doesn’t
mean it’s a good idea.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:21.519
Sentences with too many clauses are difficult
to follow, so it’s generally better to limit

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:26.449
your complex sentences to two or, maximum,
three clauses.

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:33.209
Now, you know how to build complex sentences
using independent clauses.

00:15:33.209 --> 00:15:38.759
What about dependent clauses?

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.280
Do you remember the definition of a dependent
clause?

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:49.860
A dependent clause is a part of a sentence
which would not make sense by itself.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.729
Let’s see an example:

00:15:52.729 --> 00:15:56.559
She’s taller than I am.

00:15:56.559 --> 00:16:00.259
This short sentence has two clauses.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:06.350
Can you see where the two clauses start and
end, and which one is dependent?

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.899
The two clauses are:

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:10.459
She’s taller.

00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:13.579
And: Than I am.

00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:16.170
They’re linked with the conjunction than.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.559
The second clause, than I am, is dependent.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.920
It doesn’t make sense by itself.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:30.520
Let’s see some other ways to build complex
sentences with dependent clauses.

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:42.239
You can add a dependent clause with conjunctions
like if, because, although, unless, or wherever.

00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:43.759
For example:

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:46.769
If you’re late, I’ll leave without you.

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:53.230
He’s broke because he spent all his money
on beer.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:59.400
Although she spends a lot of time at work,
she doesn’t get much done.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.480
I won’t do it unless you come with me.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.640
We can meet wherever you want.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.400
Often, you can change the order of the two
clauses if you want, so you can say:

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.269
If you’re late, I’ll leave without you.

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:22.009
Or: I’ll leave without you if you’re late.

00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:26.860
Notice that there’s a comma between the
two clauses if the dependent clause is first,

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.259
but not if the independent clause is first.

00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:37.350
What’s the difference between these complex
sentences and the ones you saw in part four?

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.820
Here, you can’t split the sentence in two.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.190
Well, you can, but one of the two parts won’t
make sense:

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.679
If you’re late.

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:52.279
I’ll leave without you.

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:59.330
I’ll leave without you is an independent
clause, so it makes sense by itself.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:06.480
But the other clause—if you’re late—is
dependent, and it doesn’t make sense by

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.940
itself.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.309
It needs something more to make it complete.

00:18:12.309 --> 00:18:21.120
What other common ways are there to build
complex sentences with dependent clauses?

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.130
Another common structure is relative clauses,
using relative pronouns like who, which or

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.419
what to link two clauses.

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:30.419
For example:

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:33.230
That’s the guy who shouted at me.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.670
I have no idea what’s going on.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.020
They gave us a cake which was made from dried
beetroot.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.300
In these cases, the dependent clause goes
after the independent clause.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.320
Let’s review what you’ve learned in this
lesson.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.500
You can build a very simple sentence, with
just a verb:

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.960
Work!

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.940
You can add a subject and complement to make
a simple sentence:

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.350
She works in a zoo.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.110
You can use adjectives and adverbs to add
description.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.809
Apparently, she works in a private zoo.

00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:20.000
You can make a complex sentence by adding
a second independent clause, with a conjunction.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.690
Apparently, she works in a private zoo, so
she must know a lot about animals.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:34.929
You can also make a complex sentence by adding
a dependent clause, or even several dependent

00:19:34.929 --> 00:19:40.780
clauses, again using conjunctions to connect
them.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:48.649
Apparently, she works in a private zoo, so
she must know a lot about animals, which surprises

00:19:48.649 --> 00:19:57.149
me because as far as I know she studied economics
at university, although I guess I could be

00:19:57.149 --> 00:20:00.559
wrong.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:07.020
This is a big topic, and it will take you
time to learn everything about these points.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:12.850
Studying conjunctions and how they work can
help you to build complex sentences which

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.789
are clear and correct.

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:22.180
Relative clauses are another useful topic
if you want to improve your sentence grammar.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:28.510
Learning about relative clauses can help you
to connect your ideas in complex sentences.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:35.850
It’s also a good idea to study verb complements
and learn what structures you can or can’t

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.480
use after a verb.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.080
Remember that a lot of sentence structure
is being able to answer the question: “What

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.480
needs to come next?”

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.340
