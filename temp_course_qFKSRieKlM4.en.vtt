00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
Do you know which one is rude? "I have&nbsp;
to work with Sarah on this project." "I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.700
get to work with Sarah on this project."&nbsp;
One of these is rude. Which one is it?&nbsp;

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.000
If you have been studying English grammar, you&nbsp;
might know that, "I have to work with Sarah on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.300
this project," is rude, but this one, "I get&nbsp;
to work with Sarah on this project," is polite.&nbsp;

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.720
Why in the world is that? Well, if you are&nbsp;
someone who thinks that English grammar is boring,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.740
English grammar is not important, well be careful,&nbsp;
because you might be making this rude mistake in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.500
English if you don't study English grammar.
I know, I know, grammar can sometimes feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.440
boring or heavy, too many details. But&nbsp;
guess what? I have some good news. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.100
here to help make English grammar enjoyable,&nbsp;
useful, and practical. Today, you are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.060
to level up your English grammar skills in&nbsp;
just one hour so that you don't make any rude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.780
mistakes the next time that you speak in English.
Hi, I am Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.900
And to help you with today's grammar lesson,&nbsp;
I have created a free PDF worksheet for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.120
Today, we're going to be going over five&nbsp;
important categories of English grammar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.240
and you can download all of these in the free&nbsp;
PDF worksheet. You can review the concepts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.420
review all of the sample sentences, and make&nbsp;
sure that it is downloaded into your brain. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.900
the next time that you speak, no problem. You can&nbsp;
use these grammar concepts easily and naturally.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.520
You can click on the link in the description&nbsp;
to download the free PDF worksheet today.&nbsp;

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.100
Let's get started with the first grammar concept,&nbsp;
which we already hinted at. The difference between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.540
get to and have to so that you're not rude, and&nbsp;
you can speak politely in English. Let's watch.&nbsp;

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.380
I'm in beautiful sunny Costa Rica. Usually I don't&nbsp;
film these videos outside, so I'm sorry if there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.580
some wind. You're going to hear some birds,&nbsp;
some trees rustling. It's all part of nature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.240
right? Hopefully it will help you&nbsp;
to relax and enjoy today's lesson.&nbsp;

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.120
We're going to be talking about how to describe&nbsp;
your vacation in English. Usually vacations have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.980
positive parts and sometimes negative parts&nbsp;
as well. So I hope that the expressions we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.240
talk about today will help you to naturally&nbsp;
describe it. And also, I'm going to show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.780
a little bit around the farm so you'll get&nbsp;
some real practice with these expressions.&nbsp;

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.220
The two expressions that we're going to&nbsp;
talk about today are to get to do something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.480
and to have to do something. Today, you are going&nbsp;
to get to guess some of the wonderful vegetation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.560
that's around me on this farm. I'm going to take&nbsp;
you on a little tour throughout this lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.940
and I want you to guess what the different&nbsp;
plants are. Let's talk about that first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.400
expression, to get to do something.
This expression has a sense of honor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.240
of privilege. A sense of, "Wow, I get&nbsp;
to be in this beautiful nature. Wow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.900
I'm so privileged. I feel honored to be here."&nbsp;
You could just use the simple past or the simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.400
present. "I am in beautiful nature." But if&nbsp;
we want to give a sense of honor, privilege,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.680
"Wow, I'm so lucky to be here." We can use get&nbsp;
to. "I get to be in this beautiful nature."&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.920
What about that second expression, to have to do&nbsp;
something? Well, in order to get to this farm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.880
we had to drive on some difficult roads.&nbsp;
They weren't always paved. There were a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.160
of potholes. They were really windy.&nbsp;
We had to drive on difficult roads.&nbsp;

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.420
When we use had to, which is the past version of&nbsp;
have to, this says a sense of something difficult,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.920
something undesirable. "I had to take out&nbsp;
the trash. I had to study for my exam." It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.080
something that's a little bit of a burden. So&nbsp;
here we have a positive expression. "I get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.440
see beautiful nature. We got to see amazing&nbsp;
iguanas on the trail." Or something negative.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.660
"We had to drive on some difficult roads to&nbsp;
get here. We had to pay $15 to get into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.140
park." Before I tell you a little story&nbsp;
about my experience here in Costa Rica,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.180
let's go to our first question where you get&nbsp;
to guess some of the plants around the farm.&nbsp;

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.300
All right, first quiz question. We have this&nbsp;
beautiful tree with these interesting things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:48.360
hanging down. Can you guess what this is? What&nbsp;
kind of plant is this? You've got three seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.260 --> 00:05:00.480
Three, two, one. It is cacao. This is the outside&nbsp;
seed, the outside pod where you'll find chocolate.&nbsp;

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.640
I hope you enjoyed that first little&nbsp;
quiz question. There's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.480
three different quiz questions throughout this&nbsp;
lesson. Let me tell you a little story about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.060
the first night that we arrived in this city.
When we got to the farm, the farmer helped us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.220
to find the house that we were staying at. It's a&nbsp;
little bungalow, a little cabin on his property.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.940
And when he tried to open the gate, he couldn't&nbsp;
open it. He tried one key, then he tried another,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.720
and he ran back to his farm, and we had to wait&nbsp;
for about 15 minutes while he looked for the key.&nbsp;

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.260
And then he came back with a key. He&nbsp;
was so excited. He tried to open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.360
gate and it didn't work well. He said, "You're&nbsp;
probably going to have to wait for another hour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.040
while we work out this problem with the key."
For a moment, I was just a little bit worried,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.020
because we have a toddler and we'd been driving&nbsp;
all day, so we wanted to just open the door and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.240
let him run free finally. But then he said&nbsp;
to us, "Well, we have a dinner available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.260
at our eating area. Would you like to be our&nbsp;
guest for dinner?" "Yes, of course we would."&nbsp;

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.780
So we got to have an amazing dinner at the farm.&nbsp;
We had some rice, and beans, and plantains,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:20.460
and chicken, and some guava juice, all produced&nbsp;
on the farm. It was our luck really that we got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.600
to eat that dinner with them because we had no&nbsp;
plans for dinner. We were kind of worried what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.400
we were going to eat, because we just arrived&nbsp;
here after a long day of traveling. So because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.560
of this problem with the key, he had to find&nbsp;
the key somehow, somewhere, we got to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.720
a great experience. Before we talk about the&nbsp;
grammatical structure of get to and have to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.520
let's go on to the second quiz.
Question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:51.900
quiz question number two. We've got these&nbsp;
interesting plants here with these little flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.460
What do you think these flowers will&nbsp;
do someday when they're not flowers?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.760
What will they become? What will this plant&nbsp;
produce? Something quite important that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.620
probably a lot of you enjoy every&nbsp;
day. Let's take a look at these.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:23.220
I'll give you three seconds. Three, two, one.&nbsp;
It's coffee. This is a coffee plant. The farm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.560
here has a lot of coffee. As you saw, also cacao.&nbsp;
And we'll see a third one in just a moment.&nbsp;

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.220
Did you enjoy that second quiz question? I hope&nbsp;
so. Let's talk about the grammatical structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.520
of using get and have in the sense of something&nbsp;
positive or something negative happening. "We got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.780
to eat dinner on the farm. He had to look for the&nbsp;
key." Here, we're conjugating that special word,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.420
get and have into the past tense. And do&nbsp;
you see what's happening after that? "We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:02.040
got to eat." Make sure that you add to&nbsp;
and then an unconjugated verb. "We got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.000
to eat. He had to look for the key." Beautiful.
Now that you know how to correctly grammatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.260
construct a sentence using get to and have&nbsp;
to, let's go on to our third quiz question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.040
and then I'll tell you a final story about&nbsp;
our trip using these beautiful expressions.&nbsp;

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.560
For our third quiz question, it's&nbsp;
quite obvious. So I want to show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.480
the base of the tree first. And as we&nbsp;
go up the tree, start thinking about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.580
what is it? What is this going to&nbsp;
produce? Here we can see a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.560
flower hanging down. What is it? What is&nbsp;
it? Are you ready to guess? Three, two, one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:51.000
It's bananas. So beautiful. I didn't know that so&nbsp;
many grew in a bunch like that. It's wonderful.&nbsp;

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.540
I hope you enjoyed that third quiz question in&nbsp;
this little mini tour of the farm. It's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:03.060
nice to see nature in other areas around the&nbsp;
world. Now that you know what get to and have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.320
to mean, and you know the correct grammatical&nbsp;
structure, let me tell you another quick story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.280
about something that we did today and something&nbsp;
that we plan to do in the future, so that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.160
see the different verb tenses for get and have.
This morning, we got to see an amazing waterfall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.960
It's one of the famous attractions of this area&nbsp;
in Costa Rica. But to get to the waterfall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.600
you have to walk down 500 steps.&nbsp;
And then to go back to your car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.420
you have to walk up 500 steps. But it was&nbsp;
really cool because we got to see the waterfall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.700
and then we walked a little bit down the path&nbsp;
and we got to really relax, and feel refreshed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.020
and wade into the water. It was quite cold.&nbsp;
There were a lot of fish. It was tons of fun.&nbsp;

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.880
And the great part was we didn't have to drive too&nbsp;
far from the farm. It was just about 15 minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.260
so not too bad. Over the next couple days, we&nbsp;
hope that we'll get to see some more animals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.780
maybe some sloths, maybe some more monkeys,&nbsp;
and more iguanas, maybe an anteater or two,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.480
some parrots, maybe some macaws. That would&nbsp;
be amazing if we get to see those. So we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:10.260
going to go to a national park and then we're&nbsp;
going to maybe get to go to Hanging Bridges Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.240
Maybe we'll get to go to the lake. We'll see.&nbsp;
But you have to drive a little bit of a distance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.100
maybe 30 minutes, an hour, an hour and a half to&nbsp;
get to those locations. But I think it'll be worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.200
it. We've already gotten to do a lot of cool&nbsp;
stuff in Costa Rica, and I hope that we'll get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.840
to do other cool things in the next couple days.
Great work. I hope you enjoyed my little vacation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.360
to Costa Rica during that lesson. The next&nbsp;
grammar lesson is going to be focusing on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:43.140
an advanced grammar sentence construction that&nbsp;
I rarely see English learners use, but native&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.360
speakers use this all the time. I want to help&nbsp;
you level up your speaking skills. Let's watch.&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.700
Do you remember learning comparisons in&nbsp;
your English classroom? Like this sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:01.020
"His bike is faster than my bike." The word&nbsp;
faster is a comparison word. Or, "Her English&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:08.400
is better than it was last year." Better is our&nbsp;
comparison word. "That picture is more beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:16.680
than mine." More beautiful are comparison words.
When we have a short word like fast, hot, easy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:24.000
green, we're just going to add E-R. Faster,&nbsp;
easier, hotter, greener. But when you have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.440
longer word like that last sentence, beautiful, or&nbsp;
intelligent, or annoying, instead of adding E-R,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.740
we're just going to add more or less. "More&nbsp;
beautiful, more intelligent, more annoying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.500
less beautiful, less intelligent, less annoying."
So these are our two ways that we can make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.960
comparisons, just as a quick review because that's&nbsp;
going to be essential for taking it to the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.400
level in our advanced sentence structure.
Let's take a look at this sentence. "The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.680
warmer it is, the happier I feel." Can you&nbsp;
pick out the two comparison words here?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:05.880
Warmer, happier. We can see that E-R at the end&nbsp;
is kind of a key to this. "The warmer it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.640
the happier I feel." Right now, it's the middle of&nbsp;
winter where I live. But occasionally every couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.380
weeks, there will be one day that feels like&nbsp;
spring. And everyone in my city goes outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.500
and jumps for joy, and all of that sadness from&nbsp;
winter just washes away. Because when it feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:28.440
warm outside, you feel great. You feel so happy.
So we could use this sentence. "The warmer it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:35.880
the happier I feel." We're comparing two things,&nbsp;
but let's take a look at actually what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.520
here. We have those two comparison words, but&nbsp;
what's happening right before that? It's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:49.260
word the. "The warmer it is, the happier I feel."
So that's going to be our key here for structuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:56.580
these sentences. At the beginning, we have some&nbsp;
kind of cause. The cause is warm weather. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.920
what's the effect? I feel happy. So we&nbsp;
have a cause and effect happening here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.000
"The warmer it is, the happier I feel."&nbsp;
Let's take a look at some other examples.&nbsp;

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:15.120
"The richer the person, the more annoying he is."&nbsp;
This is just personal opinion. So here we have two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:21.120
comparison words, richer and more annoying.&nbsp;
Because the word annoying is a longer word,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:27.120
we're going to use more in front of it instead of&nbsp;
saying annoyinger. We're not going to add E-R at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:35.160
the end. And then we have that keyword, the. "The&nbsp;
richer the person is or the richer the person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.960
the more annoying he is."
What about this one? "The sweeter the dessert,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:51.840
the more delicious it is. The sweeter," that's our&nbsp;
comparison word. "The more delicious." That's our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.940
other comparison word. "It is," and we have the&nbsp;
in front of both of those. So we have a cause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:03.120
and an effect. The dessert is sweet, and what's&nbsp;
the effect? It's more delicious. We have a cause,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.760
someone is rich. And in effect, he is more&nbsp;
annoying. So we have a cause and effect happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:14.580
here, with this wonderful advanced comparison.
Are you ready to take this to the next level? You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.980
probably already know how to make comparison&nbsp;
words. But what if we make this advanced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:26.640
concept more advanced? Often when we use the-the&nbsp;
sentence structure like we've been talking about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:34.680
we don't use that comparison word. We just&nbsp;
use the word more or less, plus a noun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:42.060
afterwards. Let's take a look at this example.
"The more you eat, the more you gain weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:50.460
The more," that's our comparison. So we're not&nbsp;
actually using a word like the warmer, or the more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.040
beautiful, or the more annoying. We're not using&nbsp;
those words. Instead, we're just saying the more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:04.020
plus a noun, you. "The more you eat, the more&nbsp;
you gain weight." Let's look at a couple others.&nbsp;

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:11.580
"The less I sleep, the less I can focus on&nbsp;
my work." We can use more or less in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:21.660
situations. "The less I," that's our noun here, "I&nbsp;
sleep. The less I can focus on my work. The more I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:28.380
speak English, the more I feel comfortable."&nbsp;
Do you see in all of these sentences, we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:33.900
just expanding on what you already know. You know&nbsp;
about comparisons. Now you know that we need the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:40.740
in front of each of them, and then we're&nbsp;
adding more or less. "The more I speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:46.740
English, the more I feel comfortable."
We could switch that around and say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:52.380
"The more comfortable I feel." There's a couple&nbsp;
different ways you can use this, but this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.360
going to be beautifully advanced to talk about&nbsp;
cause and effect, and we use this all the time.&nbsp;

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.120
In fact, there are a couple fixed phrases.&nbsp;
They're not exactly proverbs or idioms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.040
but they're just fixed phrases that native&nbsp;
speakers use a lot that include this the-the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.560
sentence structure. Let's take a look at a couple.
Someone might ask you, "How do you like your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:21.420
coffee?" Well, you could say the stronger, the&nbsp;
better. This means you don't like cream in it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.020
you don't like sugar in it. You just want a lot of&nbsp;
caffeine. Black coffee that's really strong with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:33.600
a lot of caffeine. The stronger, the better.
This is often used to talk about drinks. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.540
could even use it to talk about an alcoholic&nbsp;
drink. Do you want rum or vodka? You might say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.760
"I want both. The stronger the better." So&nbsp;
you're talking about the strength of the drink.&nbsp;

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.160
The other day I was having a bonfire in my&nbsp;
backyard and I invited a family. And they said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.800
"Hey, can I invite my other friends?" And I&nbsp;
said, "The more, the merrier." This is a really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:03.240
common the-the type of fixed sentence. The more&nbsp;
people who come, the merrier. This is kind of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.940
old-fashioned word to mean happy. The happier we&nbsp;
will be. But in that fixed sentence structure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:15.600
we do use the word merrier in daily conversation.&nbsp;
"The more, the merrier. Sure, come on." Or if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.520
you're having a problem at work and you're talking&nbsp;
with your coworker saying, "Should we tell our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:29.400
boss about this problem?" Well, your coworker&nbsp;
might say, "The less said, the better. The less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:36.600
said to our boss," the better the outcome, or&nbsp;
maybe the better for your boss, or the better for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.180
this situation. "The less said, the better."
The final common fixed phrase is one that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:49.020
procrastinators probably hear a lot, and let's&nbsp;
imagine that you need to study English or you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:57.000
to study English. But you've looked at your phone,&nbsp;
you went for a walk, you called your friends. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.540
then your husband says, "Are you going to study&nbsp;
your English lesson today?" He might also say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:14.460
"The sooner you start, the sooner you finish."&nbsp;
That phrase, the sooner the sooner is used a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.560
"The sooner you begin exercising, the sooner&nbsp;
you'll feel better." The sooner you do something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:29.760
if you do something now, you'll see the results&nbsp;
quicker. You'll see them sooner. So we often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.500
use this, "The sooner you start, the sooner you&nbsp;
finish," or, "The sooner you'll see the result."&nbsp;

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.340
And now I'd like to share a quick&nbsp;
conversation dialogue with you that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:43.140
uses this advanced sentence structure a&nbsp;
lot. I challenge you after this lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:49.080
go back and try to say those sentences with us.&nbsp;
That's going to train your speaking muscles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.840
help with your pronunciation, and also remind you&nbsp;
how to use this, because you're using it yourself.&nbsp;

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.220
I've been feeling kind of down&nbsp;
lately, but I'm not sure why.&nbsp;

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.040
Dan:
Have you been working too much again?&nbsp;

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.580
Vanessa:
Well, I go to work at 6:00 AM and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.280
finish at 8:00 PM, but that's fine with me.
Dan:&nbsp;

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.840
Whoa, that's a long time. Maybe the more&nbsp;
you work, the more stressed you feel.&nbsp;

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.060
Vanessa:
I don't know. I guess I have neglected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.860
to see my friends lately.
Dan:&nbsp;

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.160
Yeah. The more you see your friends,&nbsp;
the more positive you'll feel.&nbsp;

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.160
Vanessa:
Yeah. I do feel kind of lonely. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.400
less I do outside of work, the less connected I&nbsp;
feel to them. Maybe I have been working too much.&nbsp;

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.660
Dan:
I'd say so.&nbsp;

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.420
Vanessa:
In fact, the more I tell you about my work life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.910
the more I realize I need balance.
Dan:&nbsp;

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.280
Yeah. The more work, the more stress.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.320
Yeah. The more down I feel.
Dan:&nbsp;

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.220
But the more time with friends,&nbsp;
the happier, the more connected.&nbsp;

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.700
Vanessa:
The more encouraged, but also the poorer.&nbsp;

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.080
Dan:
What, the poorer?&nbsp;

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.180
Vanessa:
Yeah, because I would be spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.250
money instead of making money.
Dan:&nbsp;

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.560
Don't worry about that. The more money you&nbsp;
make, the more you can spend. Let's go have fun.&nbsp;

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.620
Vanessa:
Okay. You convinced me. Let's go.&nbsp;

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:09.060
Great work leveling up your speaking skills. The&nbsp;
next grammar lesson focuses on two tricky words,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:15.780
do versus make. You will join me in&nbsp;
the woods again in nature. Sometimes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.580
this helps make grammar a little more fun, where&nbsp;
you're going to learn some important expressions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:26.160
that can help you learn the difference between do&nbsp;
and make in your daily conversations. Let's watch.&nbsp;

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:33.960
We use do for specific tasks, some&nbsp;
obligations, or repetitive activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:42.060
"I need to do some housework." This is an&nbsp;
obligation, a duty, to do some housework.&nbsp;

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:48.900
We use make for creating or producing something.&nbsp;
"I need to make some soup. I'm creating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.940
soup." Today we're going to be in two different&nbsp;
locations, one in the woods and one by the stream,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.740
so that you can visually remember the difference&nbsp;
between these two words. I hope that it will just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.700
add to this experience so that you can enjoy&nbsp;
the lesson, and also remember these words.&nbsp;

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:09.540
But this can be tricky because cooking meals&nbsp;
is kind of an obligation or a duty, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.680
I hope that by talking about some specific&nbsp;
expressions with both of these words,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.440
it'll help you to remember them, but also it'll&nbsp;
help you to keep those words together. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:25.080
hear make soup, make soup, make soup a lot,&nbsp;
your brain will keep these two words together.&nbsp;

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:31.200
It's kind of like when you were first starting to&nbsp;
learn English, you never heard, "I were happy."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.940
You always heard, "I was happy." Because you&nbsp;
never heard, "I were happy," you probably didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.560
create that wrong sentence structure. So I&nbsp;
hope that by hearing this correct sentence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.760
structure again and again, you're going to be&nbsp;
able to remember if it's do, or if it's make.&nbsp;

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:54.060
Let's start by talking about seven expressions&nbsp;
using do. "Everyone loves doing chores. I dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.880
about doing the laundry. Doing the dishes is my&nbsp;
favorite activity." Okay, maybe that's not true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:06.180
for you. But here, we're using do to talk about&nbsp;
this duty, this obligation, this repetitive task.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:13.020
We use do to talk about almost every household&nbsp;
chore. "Do the laundry, do the dishes." Except&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:18.900
make the bed. This is an exception, but we often&nbsp;
use do to talk about those household repetitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:25.680
chores. For more household chores, check out my&nbsp;
video 70 Cleaning Expressions in English up here.&nbsp;

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.380
Number two, "I can't go play a game because&nbsp;
I have to do some work," or maybe because,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.660
"I have to do some homework." To do&nbsp;
work is a common expression. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.980
I said this to Dan when I was writing this&nbsp;
lesson. He wanted me to play a game and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:46.740
"I'm sorry. I can't play the game because I have&nbsp;
to do some work," which was writing this lesson.&nbsp;

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:53.280
Number three, Dan, my husband plays hockey. And&nbsp;
after his game he often says, "The goalie did a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:00.960
good job, but we still lost." Or maybe he said,&nbsp;
"The goalie did a bad job. The goalie did a poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:08.340
job." Here we're talking about doing a good job,&nbsp;
doing a bad job, doing a poor job. We're using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:15.480
word do in the past to say did. "He did a good&nbsp;
job?" What do you think about this lesson? Am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:23.340
I doing a good job explaining these expressions?
Number four, have you done any exercises recently?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:32.220
Maybe you might say, "I did some yoga yesterday&nbsp;
and I'm going to do some Pilates today." This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:39.840
question uses do in another verb tense. "Have you&nbsp;
done any exercises recently?" This can be a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:46.020
bit tricky to talk about do plus exercise, because&nbsp;
we often just take out do completely and say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:54.840
"Have you exercised recently?" This is using&nbsp;
exercise as the verb. "Have you exercised?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.940
Notice the E-D. That tells us that this&nbsp;
is a verb. "Have you exercised recently?"&nbsp;

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:07.200
But in my original sentence, "Have you done any&nbsp;
exercises?" This is using exercise as a noun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.160
and then do is our verb. So make sure&nbsp;
that you use this correctly. We don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:16.500
want to have do plus exercise as a verb.&nbsp;
We need to only have one verb here. "Have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:22.620
you done any exercises? Have you exercised?"
Number five, "How are you doing? I'm doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:28.500
pretty well. I'm not doing that hot." This is&nbsp;
a common greeting. You might hear this all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.820
time. Maybe you say this a lot. To learn&nbsp;
some other common greetings and other ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.320
to start sentences, you can check out this&nbsp;
link up here. "How are you doing? I'm doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:43.380
great. I'm not doing that hot." Wonderful.
Number six, "I always try to do my best."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:49.680
To do my best is a beautiful expression. It&nbsp;
means you're not perfect, but you try to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:56.040
your best. If you said this in a job interview, "I&nbsp;
always try to do my best every day at work," wow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.320
great. You're hired. This is a wonderful way&nbsp;
to express that you are a diligent worker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.220
you're a hard worker. And even though you're not&nbsp;
perfect, you're going to always do your best.&nbsp;

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:11.100
Number seven, "Please, do something. Do&nbsp;
anything." Maybe if you have a friend who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.900
is single and is always complaining about&nbsp;
not going on a date, you might say, "Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:21.060
maybe it'd be a good idea if you got out of your&nbsp;
house one day. Maybe you should go to a yoga&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.380
class. Maybe you should go for a walk in the park&nbsp;
and talk to someone while you're walking your dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:34.200
Just do something. Do anything." We often use do&nbsp;
with these words something, anything. And it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.300
specific. Something and anything is not telling&nbsp;
a specific activity, but we often use those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.700
together. You can also use this in a less intense&nbsp;
situation. Maybe if your friend's inviting you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:50.760
go to a yoga class, you might say, "I can't go to&nbsp;
yoga class because I have to do something else."&nbsp;

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:56.220
You're not saying what you have to do.&nbsp;
It's kind of mysterious. You're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.820
saying that other activity that you need&nbsp;
to do, but you're just saying, "I need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:05.940
to do something else." To do something else.
Now let's go on to make. These are the top 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:11.820
expressions using make, at least according to me.
Number one, "Dan makes oatmeal for us every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:18.180
morning. I like to make green tea in the&nbsp;
afternoon." We often use make with food or drinks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.680
and it's a good way to use this naturally.
Number two, "If you watch the ad at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:28.980
beginning of this video, I make some money."&nbsp;
Thanks. Here I'm not creating or producing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:34.920
I'm not printing the money myself. But here,&nbsp;
I'm still acquiring the money. So I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:40.260
know when you were in high school, what did you do&nbsp;
to make money? Did you babysit? Did you walk your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.880
neighbor's dog? Did you do your neighbor's&nbsp;
homework? What did you do to make money?&nbsp;

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.620
Sentence number three, "It can be tough&nbsp;
to make new friends when you move to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:55.200
new city." Here we're using the expression&nbsp;
make friends. You're not actually creating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.140
your friends like Frankenstein, at least I&nbsp;
hope not. But you are acquiring new friends.&nbsp;

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.900
When I think about the friends that I have now,&nbsp;
I made one friend at the grocery store, I made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.120
another friend at yoga class, and I made another&nbsp;
friend 10 years ago in college. So as an adult,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.740
we make friends in a lot of different ways.
Have you ever made a phone call in English?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.760
This can be a little bit scary when you&nbsp;
do it, but with practice it gets easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.740
We have a couple expressions we use when we&nbsp;
talk about using the phone. But when you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:31.680
the one dialing the numbers, you are the one&nbsp;
who's making a phone call. If you want to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.880
some common expressions for phone conversations,&nbsp;
then make sure to check out this video up here.&nbsp;

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:41.580
Number five, make a suggestion about what&nbsp;
kind of lesson you'd like me to make here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.440
on YouTube in the future. I'm asking you&nbsp;
to make a suggestion. Give me some ideas.&nbsp;

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:53.100
Number six, when you make a mistake, don't make&nbsp;
an excuse. Just tell the truth. Here are two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:58.740
for the price of one. Make a mistake and make&nbsp;
an excuse. I often hear English learners say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:06.240
"I did a mistake," and to them I would say, yep.&nbsp;
Yep, you did. You made a mistake. If you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.800
use did, you could say, "I did something&nbsp;
wrong." But here, this is a beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.660
expression that you can use instead with make.&nbsp;
"I made a mistake." And if you make a mistake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:22.800
don't make an excuse. No one likes someone who&nbsp;
makes excuses. "I was tired, I was hungry. There&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.660
was a lot of traffic." Don't make an excuse. Just&nbsp;
tell the truth, and say you're sorry, and move on.&nbsp;

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:33.960
Number seven, "I often read reviews to help&nbsp;
me make a decision before I buy something."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.000
Do you do that? Do you read reviews before&nbsp;
you buy something? What helps you to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.340
a decision? Have you ever made a decision&nbsp;
that you regretted? I hope you don't regret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:49.860
making the decision to watch this lesson.
Study these words so that you can make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:57.960
that you use them correctly. We often say, make&nbsp;
sure to mean make certain, be certain. But we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.420
don't use that one as much, so forget about that&nbsp;
one and just remember make sure. We often use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.220
this as kind of a reminder. Make sure that you&nbsp;
finish your homework. Make sure that you clean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.100
your room. Make sure, make sure, make sure. So if&nbsp;
you use, make sure as a reminder to someone else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.800
make sure you say it with a smile because it can&nbsp;
be kind of annoying if someone says, "Make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.820
you do this, make sure you do this, make sure you&nbsp;
do this," so make sure you say it with a smile.&nbsp;

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.680
Number nine, it really makes me happy that you're&nbsp;
still watching this video and didn't click away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:35.220
Your actions have an effect on me. It makes me&nbsp;
happy. Or we could use this in a negative way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:42.660
"Talking with her about her problems makes me&nbsp;
feel drained." Or maybe watching these lessons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:49.140
makes you feel excited about English. It makes&nbsp;
you react in a certain way. Makes me feel happy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.880
makes me feel drained, makes me feel excited.&nbsp;
I hope that this lesson makes you feel excited,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.580
because I'm sitting on a log suspended over&nbsp;
the creek, and it's not very comfortable. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.300
it makes me happy that you're still watching&nbsp;
this and that this experience is worth it.&nbsp;

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:11.100
Number 10, try to use English every day. This&nbsp;
advice just makes sense. If someone told you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:16.980
"Study English for six hours every Saturday, and&nbsp;
you can forget about English the other six days of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:22.560
the week." This advice doesn't really make sense.&nbsp;
It feels really stressful to me. So when you use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:30.060
this expression, "It makes sense. It doesn't make&nbsp;
sense." We're using this in the sense of sensible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:36.900
This is the root word here. It is sensible advice&nbsp;
to study English a little bit every day. It is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.640
sensible advice to study English just one day&nbsp;
for a long period of time. You feel stressed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:46.800
you don't remember things easily. So it makes&nbsp;
sense to study English little by little every day.&nbsp;

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.780
I think it makes sense to have a review now,&nbsp;
don't you think? Let's go back and review all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.560
the expressions that we talked about with do, and&nbsp;
all of the expressions we talked about with make.&nbsp;

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:02.520
Let's review the seven expressions with do.&nbsp;
Number one, "Everyone loves doing chores.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:10.980
I have to do some work. The goalie did a&nbsp;
good job. I did some exercises yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.260
How are you doing? I'm doing pretty&nbsp;
well. I always try to do my best.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.240
I have to do something else."
And now the, 10 expressions with make.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:31.020
Number one, "Dan makes us oatmeal." Number two, "I&nbsp;
make some money. It can be tough to make friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:39.360
I need to make a phone call. Make a suggestion in&nbsp;
the comments. When you make a mistake, don't make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:46.620
an excuse. The reviews often help me to make a&nbsp;
decision. Make sure you clean your room before you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:53.280
go to bed. It makes me happy that you watched&nbsp;
this lesson. This advice just makes sense."&nbsp;

00:31:54.540 --> 00:32:00.720
Great work learning the difference between do and&nbsp;
make so that you can use this accurately as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:07.080
speak. The next grammar lesson is going to focus&nbsp;
on storytelling. We are constantly telling stories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.480
When we speak. Oftentimes, we're talking about&nbsp;
something that happened in the past. It might be,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.640
"What did you do over the weekend? How was your&nbsp;
last vacation?" Well, you're probably going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:23.400
tell a little quick story about your weekend&nbsp;
plans, or what you did on your last vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:30.060
So I would like to help you use the correct verbs&nbsp;
to talk about stories in the past. Let's watch.&nbsp;

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:39.060
Today's lesson has three levels. We'll start with&nbsp;
easy, then intermediate, and then advanced. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:46.320
finally at the end, there is a quiz to see if you&nbsp;
have accomplished the goal of understanding and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:52.500
being able to use clear natural English. All&nbsp;
right, let's get started with the easy level.&nbsp;

00:32:52.500 --> 00:33:02.220
For our easy level, we have the past simple. These&nbsp;
are simply actions that happened in the past. Most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:10.200
of these end in E-D. Let's take a look at a couple&nbsp;
just to review. We have study, becomes studied. "I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:17.400
studied English yesterday." Practice becomes&nbsp;
practiced. "I practiced the piano for three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:27.360
hours." I wish. Or, learn becomes learned. "I&nbsp;
learned a lot with Vanessa's lessons." Hooray.&nbsp;

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:33.300
Now, not every past simple verb ends&nbsp;
in E-D. There are some irregulars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:40.440
and usually that means that the vowel changes.&nbsp;
Let's take a look at a couple. Wake becomes woke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:51.180
"I woke up before my alarm clock." It's a small&nbsp;
miracle. Break and eat become broke and ate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:51.180 --> 00:34:01.440
"I broke my cookies before I ate them." Drink&nbsp;
becomes drank. "I drank some tea this morning."&nbsp;

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:08.220
Before we go to the intermediate level, I have&nbsp;
a quick question for you. I can't believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:19.020
yesterday, I English for 30 minutes. Great work.&nbsp;
I can't believe that yesterday, I speak, spoke,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:24.780
or speaked English for 30 minutes? Which one do&nbsp;
you think is correct? I'll give you three seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:33.900
I can't believe that yesterday, I spoke English&nbsp;
for 30 minutes. Congratulations. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.160
let's go on to the intermediate level.&nbsp;
Are you ready to level up? Let's do it.&nbsp;

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:45.720
In the intermediate level, we have the past&nbsp;
continuous. Can you guess when you might use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:52.140
this? When there is a continual action in the&nbsp;
past. Let's take a look at a quick example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:58.680
Let's imagine that you call me, and I don't pick&nbsp;
up the phone. Well, eventually when you see me you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:06.900
might say, "Why didn't you pick up the phone when&nbsp;
I called?" I could say, "I was preparing to film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:15.780
a lesson, and I didn't have time to talk." This&nbsp;
verb, "I was preparing," is the past continuous.&nbsp;

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:23.160
If you can imagine with me a timeline and we&nbsp;
have an action that happened when you called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:30.900
well, what's happening before, during, and&nbsp;
after this? Well, I was preparing to film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:37.680
the lesson. A lot happens to prepare to film&nbsp;
these lessons. I need to write the lesson. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.960
need to get ready. I need to make sure my house&nbsp;
is quiet. My kids need to be outside somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:49.080
They need to be safely with someone outside. I&nbsp;
need to be feeling energized and ready. A lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.940
goes into preparing these lessons.
So, we could say that you called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:53.940 --> 00:36:01.740
and I was preparing the lesson before you called,&nbsp;
I was preparing the lesson during your call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:08.160
and I was preparing for the lesson after&nbsp;
your call. So this is a continual action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:15.120
that is interrupted by one singular past action.&nbsp;
Let's take a look at a couple other examples.&nbsp;

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:21.780
"At 9:00 PM, I studied for the test." This is the&nbsp;
past simple. Why? Because it is an action that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:28.560
happened at a specific time. "At 9:00 PM I started&nbsp;
to study for the test." But what happens if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:36.600
change this? "At 9:00 PM, I was studying for the&nbsp;
test. This means something slightly different."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:43.260
It means that before 9:00 PM I was studying,&nbsp;
at 9:00 PM I was studying, and after 9:00 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:49.020
I was studying. This was a continual action&nbsp;
that happened including that 9:00 PM moment.&nbsp;

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:55.920
Let's take a look at another example. "I woke&nbsp;
up early today. Woke is the past simple. I woke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:03.480
up early today." It is finished. But let's change&nbsp;
it to the past continuous. "I was waking up early&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:11.820
every day during the summer." Do you understand&nbsp;
this slight difference here? "I was waking up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:18.660
every day during the summer." This implies that&nbsp;
this happened continually throughout the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:25.020
summer. It was a continual action that happened&nbsp;
in the past. Let's take a look at another example.&nbsp;

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:31.260
"I drank my tea before work." Okay, this&nbsp;
is past simple. It finished before work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:37.980
"I drank my tea before work." But what if&nbsp;
we change this to past continuous? "I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:48.000
drinking my tea while I worked." Okay. Here&nbsp;
we have an activity that continued during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.380
the workday. "I was drinking my tea while I&nbsp;
worked." This is something that's continuing.&nbsp;

00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:03.240
Before we go on to the advanced level, let's have&nbsp;
a quick quiz question to test your intermediate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:09.900
skills. Can you fill in the blank in this&nbsp;
sentence? Sorry that I didn't call you back? I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:17.040
English with Vanessa. I were&nbsp;
studying English with Vanessa.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:24.120
I was studying English with Vanessa.&nbsp;
Or, I studied English with Vanessa.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.100
Which one is the best? I'll give&nbsp;
you three seconds. Three, two, one.&nbsp;

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:36.180
"Sorry that I didn't call you back. I was studying&nbsp;
English with Vanessa." This is an action that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:42.300
happening before the call, during the call, and&nbsp;
after the call. "I was studying English with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.880
Vanessa when you called." Okay, congratulations.&nbsp;
Let's go on to the advanced level.&nbsp;

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:53.580
Now that you know each of these verb&nbsp;
tenses individually, the past simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:59.580
and the past continuous, let's put them&nbsp;
together and see what happens. Do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:06.720
remember the original sentence that I said in&nbsp;
this lesson? "Dan was cooking breakfast when I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:14.700
woke up." And this made me say, "It surprised&nbsp;
me." Why did this surprise me? Let's see.&nbsp;

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:23.700
Here we have a continual action. Dan was cooking&nbsp;
breakfast, boom, interrupted by when I woke up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:31.560
So that means Dan woke up before me, he prepared&nbsp;
breakfast before I woke up, and he was preparing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:38.580
it while I was waking up. And when I woke up, he&nbsp;
was still preparing breakfast. This is very kind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:44.880
very thoughtful, and maybe something that happens&nbsp;
on my birthday. So this is something we can say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:50.040
"Oh," to when this happens. I'm not sure&nbsp;
if this happens often in your household&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.480
that when you wake up, someone else is&nbsp;
preparing breakfast. But if this happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.580
in my house, it would be an amazing thing.
Let's take a look at this image. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:06.420
this gives a good visual to the ideas that we're&nbsp;
talking about. We have a long, winding road. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:13.260
is the past continuous event. "Dan was cooking&nbsp;
breakfast." But what is in the middle of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:21.120
road? It's a dotted line. So it's interrupted&nbsp;
by events, but the road is still continuing.&nbsp;

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:27.480
So Dan was cooking breakfast. Boom. When I&nbsp;
woke up. When I said, "What are you doing?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:34.380
When I said, "What an amazing breakfast." It&nbsp;
is interrupted by these past simple events.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:40.380
Let's take a look at a couple other examples&nbsp;
where this past continuous event is interrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:46.260
by some past simple events. Let's take a look.
"I haven't really studied English much lately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:55.740
But when I was studying English, I practiced&nbsp;
every day." Here we have an interrupted action.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:01.860
I practiced every day during the time that I was&nbsp;
studying. Let's take a look at another sentence.&nbsp;

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:09.600
"When I was drinking my tea, you&nbsp;
called me. When I was drinking my tea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:18.600
my cat knocked over my cup." Naughty cat. "When&nbsp;
I was drinking my tea, my kid screamed, 'Mommy!'"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:27.180
Do you think you can pass the advanced quiz&nbsp;
before we go on to our final exam? I hope so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:36.780
and I hope that this sentence is not true for you.
When I Vanessa's lesson, I asleep. Oh no.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:44.340
Let's see which one of these do you think is&nbsp;
correct. When I were watching Vanessa's lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:56.100
I fall asleep. When I watch Vanessa's lesson, I&nbsp;
fell asleep. When I was watching Vanessa's lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:01.560
I fell asleep. I hope that none of these&nbsp;
are true. I'll give you three seconds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:07.500
think of the best grammatical answer.&nbsp;
Are you ready? Three, two, one. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:15.960
I was watching Vanessa's lesson, I fell asleep.
Oh no. Wake up, because it is time for your drum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:23.700
roll, final exam. What I'm going to do is I'm&nbsp;
going to read a little story with some blanks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:30.780
and I want you to guess the best answer. And at&nbsp;
the very end, I'm going to read the final story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:36.000
and I hope that you can pat yourself&nbsp;
on the back because you correctly told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.720
this story in English. Let's see.
Last night I, when suddenly I,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:52.560
some carrots on the floor. Let me read it&nbsp;
one more time. Last night I, when suddenly I,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:58.920
some carrots on the floor. I'll give you&nbsp;
three seconds to think of the best answer.&nbsp;

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:09.660
"Last night I was cooking, when suddenly I&nbsp;
dropped some carrots on the floor." Why did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:23.460
I do that? Let me tell you. I the carrots and&nbsp;
I a loud knock at the door. I the carrots and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:29.760
a loud knock at the door. I'll give&nbsp;
you three seconds. Three, two, one.&nbsp;

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:40.980
I was cutting the carrots, and I heard a loud&nbsp;
knock at the door. It was my neighbor, so I,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:51.300
just a minute. I it was my neighbor,&nbsp;
so I just a minute. Three, two, one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:51.300 --> 00:44:01.860
"I thought it was my neighbor, so I yelled, 'Just&nbsp;
a minute.'" Then a little voice said, Mommy, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:13.380
with my friends and I a snake, come look. Then&nbsp;
I heard a little voice that said, mommy, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:23.220
with my friends and I a snake. Come look. Three,&nbsp;
two, one. Then I heard a little voice that said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:31.920
"Mommy, I was playing with my friends&nbsp;
and I cut a snake. Come look. Oh my."&nbsp;

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.160
In just a moment, I will tell you if this is a&nbsp;
true story or not. Let me read the entire story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:44.280
and we can see how it sounds with the correct verb&nbsp;
tenses. "Last night I was cooking, when suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:51.900
I dropped some carrots on the floor. Why did I do&nbsp;
that? Let me tell you. I was cutting the carrots,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:58.800
and I heard a loud knock at the door. I thought&nbsp;
it was my neighbor, so I yelled, 'Just a minute.'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:06.900
Then a little voice said, 'Mommy, I was playing&nbsp;
with my friends and I caught a snake. Come look.'"&nbsp;

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:15.660
Great work leveling up your storytelling skills.&nbsp;
Our final grammar lesson today is a big one. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:22.440
is the difference between three small, but&nbsp;
tricky words in English. In, on, and at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:29.100
I get asked this all the time by English learners,&nbsp;
so here's the lesson to help you finally master&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:35.580
these three tricky words. Let's watch.
Each of the prepositions in, on, and at,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:42.720
can be used to talk about space and time.&nbsp;
Let's take a look at some examples so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:51.180
we can study before the test. In. "I put the&nbsp;
medicine in the cabinet in the afternoon."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:52.080 --> 00:46:02.520
Here we have space, "In the cabinet," and time,&nbsp;
"In the afternoon." We use in for an enclosed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:11.220
space. "In the cabinet." And for a general time,&nbsp;
usually a time of day. "In the morning, in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:20.160
afternoon, in the evening." This general time.
On. "I put my phone on the shelf on Monday."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:32.520
Here we have space, "On the shelf," and time, "On&nbsp;
Monday." Usually on is with a surface. Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:40.860
it's a flat surface, sometimes it's not, but we&nbsp;
talk about on with a surface. On the shelf. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:46.980
for time, we're talking about a specific&nbsp;
day on Monday, on Tuesday, on Wednesday.&nbsp;

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:57.480
This video is coming out on Friday. And at.&nbsp;
"Please be at the entrance of the park at 4:00&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:07.380
PM." We have space, "At the entrance," and time,&nbsp;
"At 4:00 PM. At the entrance of the park," is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:17.280
specific place, a specific point at the entrance&nbsp;
of the park. And for time, "At 4:00 PM," we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:26.640
talking about a specific time, "At 4:00 PM.&nbsp;
At 9:00 PM. At 3:00 AM." The specific time.&nbsp;

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:32.040
So we've had a little review here. Don't&nbsp;
stress too much about the rules. I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.300
you to look into your heart. As&nbsp;
I give you these test sentences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:42.960
I want you to choose which word is the best&nbsp;
to fill in each of these sentences. Maybe you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.920
remember the rules, maybe you don't.&nbsp;
That's okay. Remember those patterns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:52.620
we talked about. Your brain has created some&nbsp;
patterns already using these three words. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:58.320
let's get started with sentence number one.
Did you find your coat the closet?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:06.000
Did you find your coat in, on, at the closet?&nbsp;
I'll give you three seconds to decide.&nbsp;

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:18.660
"Did you find your coat in the closet." In is&nbsp;
an enclosed space. The closet is an enclosed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:26.580
space. Did you find your coat in the closet?
Number two, my favorite cafe is the end of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:38.340
street. My favorite cafe is in, on, at the end of&nbsp;
this street. What do you think? Three, two, one.&nbsp;

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:46.740
"My favorite cafe is at the end of this street."&nbsp;
Here we're talking about a specific place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:52.080
A specific point at the end of&nbsp;
this street is my favorite cafe.&nbsp;

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:58.680
How are you doing so far? Take a deep breath. You&nbsp;
got this. All right, let's go to number three.&nbsp;

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:09.540
Oh no I spilled my coffee, my homework. Oh no,&nbsp;
I spilled my coffee in, on, at my homework.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:16.020
Three, two, one.
"Oh no, I spilled my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:25.980
coffee on my homework." Here we're talking about&nbsp;
the surface of my homework. It also happens to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:34.020
a flat surface. Like I mentioned, we sometimes&nbsp;
use this for flat surfaces. On my homework. Oh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:39.480
man. Now I'm going to have to explain this to my&nbsp;
teacher. "I spilled my coffee on my homework."&nbsp;

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:50.580
Number four, I enjoy taking walks early the&nbsp;
morning. I enjoy taking walks early in, on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:59.340
at the morning. Three, two, one.
"I enjoy taking walks early in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:05.220
the morning. Here we are talking about a&nbsp;
general time of day. We're not talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:13.200
9:00 AM. We are talking about a general time in&nbsp;
the morning, in the afternoon. And this is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:19.740
of the keys to remembering prepositions is when&nbsp;
you can remember a full phrase in the morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:25.200
you're not going to need to think about&nbsp;
the rules. General time, specific time. No,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.700
you don't need to think about that because you&nbsp;
know the full phrase. So sentences like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:34.680
are great ways to remember these tricky words.&nbsp;
"In the morning." Let's go to the next question.&nbsp;

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:44.940
Number five, my date will be here&nbsp;
5:15. My date will be here in, on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:50.520
at 5:15. We're talking about time&nbsp;
here. I'll give you three seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:52.680 --> 00:51:04.320
"My date will be here at 5:15." Hopefully not&nbsp;
5:14. Hopefully not 5:16. 5:15. Maybe not exactly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:13.260
but you know what I mean. Here, we're talking&nbsp;
about a specific time. 5:15, 6:15, 7:45,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:22.260
at 5:15. All right, let's get to the next one.
Number six, I love to spend summer vacation the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:30.420
mountains. I love to spend summer&nbsp;
vacation in, on, at the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:39.360
Give you three seconds. Three, two, one.
The best answer for this sentence is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:47.340
"I love to spend summer vacations in the&nbsp;
mountains." We're not talking about digging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:54.360
a hole in the mountains and going inside the&nbsp;
dirt and the rocks. No, this would really be an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:54.360 --> 00:52:02.520
enclosed space. In the closet, in the cabinet.
But sometimes we use the idea of an enclosed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:10.080
space a little bit more loosely. So here, we're&nbsp;
talking about being surrounded by the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:18.180
It's the idea that you're somewhat enclosed in&nbsp;
the warm embrace of the mountains. So sometimes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:22.260
we do use this a little bit more&nbsp;
loosely, but you can get the idea here.&nbsp;

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:30.120
Number seven, we are having dinner. My&nbsp;
favorite restaurant. We're having dinner in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:38.850
on, at my favorite restaurant. I'll give&nbsp;
you three seconds. Three, two, one. "We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:47.580
are having dinner at my favorite restaurant."&nbsp;
This is a specific place. A specific point, at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:53.160
my favorite restaurant. Well, that's where we're&nbsp;
going to be having dinner. We're having dinner at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:53.160 --> 00:53:00.480
my favorite restaurant. A specific place.
Number eight. I jumped when he tapped me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:10.920
the shoulder. I jumped when he tapped me&nbsp;
in, on, at the shoulder. Three, two, one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:20.220
"I jumped when he tapped me on the shoulder."&nbsp;
This is also a little more loose, but we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:26.880
talking about the surface of my shoulder,&nbsp;
the surface of my skin. "When he tapped me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:35.400
on the shoulder." This is the surface of it. It's&nbsp;
not inside my skin. This is just the surface. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:41.940
tapped me on the shoulder. How are you doing? We&nbsp;
have two more sentences. Let's go to number nine.&nbsp;

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:51.900
Do you have a date Saturday night? Do you have a&nbsp;
date in, on, at Saturday night? Do you remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:59.580
which one we should use with days like Saturday?&nbsp;
I'll give you three seconds. Three, two, one.&nbsp;

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:08.100
"Do you have a date on Saturday&nbsp;
night?" We use on for a specific day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:14.880
on Saturday, on Friday, on Tuesday.&nbsp;
"Do you have a date on Saturday night?"&nbsp;

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:21.060
And our final test question before we&nbsp;
get to five fixed phrases using in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:29.820
on, and at is this. You can email me&nbsp;
contact@speakenglishwithvanessa.com. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:34.440
a common phrase we use in business or whenever you&nbsp;
need to tell someone your email address. So it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:45.060
a good expression to remember. You can email me&nbsp;
in, on, or at my email address. Three, two, one.&nbsp;

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:52.440
"You can email me at&nbsp;
contact@speakenglishwithvanessa.com." This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:52.440 --> 00:55:00.240
is also a more figurative way to use a specific&nbsp;
place. So we said at my favorite restaurant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:07.740
at the entrance of the park. But this is not a&nbsp;
place you can go. You can't go physically to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:14.520
email address. So we're going to use this a little&nbsp;
bit more loosely, and we can say, you can email me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:22.200
at. This is my specific email address. "You can&nbsp;
email me at contact@speakenglishwithvanessa.com."&nbsp;

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:29.700
Great. Are you ready for five bonus&nbsp;
fixed phrases that include in, on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:34.500
or at? These are kind of outside the rules of what&nbsp;
we just talked about, but I want you to look into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:40.320
your heart and to guess which proposition do you&nbsp;
think would be the best fit. Let's look at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:51.120
sentence. The building is fire. The building&nbsp;
is in, on, at fire. What is the fixed phrase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:59.700
we're looking for here? Three, two, one.
"The building is on fire." Run. So here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:05.400
we're using the fixed phrase to be on fire.&nbsp;
We can use this in a real way, that there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:11.460
flames coming up from the building, so get out of&nbsp;
the building. It's on fire. But we can also use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:19.020
this for more figurative ways. For example, you&nbsp;
might say, "My motivation for learning English is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:26.580
on fire from watching Vanessa's video," or talking&nbsp;
about your motivation is on fire. Or we might say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:35.820
"I'm on fire for English." This is talking about&nbsp;
a more figurative way of talking about fire. Of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:41.460
course there is not fire on you, but we're talking&nbsp;
about in your heart. There is an excitement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:49.980
there's determination, there's motivation. "I'm&nbsp;
on fire for English." My motivation is on fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:53.640
and that is another way to use this expression.&nbsp;
All right, let's go to the next sentence.&nbsp;

00:56:53.640 --> 00:57:01.680
Do you believe love at first sight? Do&nbsp;
you believe in, on, at love at first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:09.660
sight? Give you three seconds. Three, two, one.
"Do you believe in love at first sight?" Here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:14.820
our fixed expression is to believe in&nbsp;
something. You can believe in love,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:20.820
you can believe in peace. You can believe in&nbsp;
your ability to learn English. You can believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:27.240
in something, and this means you have hope that&nbsp;
it will happen. You have high hopes that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:35.460
will come true. "I believe in love." Wonderful.
Question number 13, he is really good juggling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:42.420
Juggling is when you throw balls in the&nbsp;
air. He is really good in, on, at juggling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:51.480
I'll tell you in three, two, one.
"He is really good at juggling." Here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:56.400
we're going to use the fixed expression to&nbsp;
be good at something. This is used all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:02.100
time. You might say, "I thought that I wasn't&nbsp;
good at English. And then I found Vanessa's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:08.040
lessons and realized it's not too hard. I&nbsp;
can do this." You can be good at English.&nbsp;

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:15.120
Number 14, do you have this a smaller&nbsp;
size? This is a common expression when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:23.340
you're shopping. Do you have this in on,&nbsp;
or, at a smaller size? Three, two, one.&nbsp;

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:31.440
"Do you have this in a smaller size?" This&nbsp;
expression to be in a size or color is commonly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.640
used when we're shopping and we're trying to&nbsp;
find the best thing that we are looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:42.540
So you might say, "Do you have this in a large?&nbsp;
Do you have this in a medium?" Or we can use it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:48.360
for color. "Do you have this in red? Do&nbsp;
you have this in stripes?" Great. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:54.720
a great expression to use when you're shopping.
And our final test question. Are you ready? Drum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:08.220
roll, is my date was his phone all night.&nbsp;
It was so rude. My date was in, on, at his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:19.560
phone all night. Such a shame. Three, two, one.
"My date was on his phone all night. It was so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:27.900
rude." He's not actually standing on his phone.&nbsp;
But instead, that means he's using his phone. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:33.660
this is a common expression, to be on your phone.&nbsp;
Sometimes, you could say this maybe to teenagers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:43.500
"Hey, get off your phone. You are on your phone&nbsp;
all day. Why are you always on your phone? I wish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:48.900
I wasn't on my phone so much." It doesn't mean&nbsp;
that you're standing on your phone. it just means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:53.280
you are using your phone. So this is a great&nbsp;
fixed expression to note, to be on your phone.&nbsp;

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:58.080
So let's do a little review. I'm going to&nbsp;
read all of these sentences one more time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:03.180
and I would like you to try to say them out loud&nbsp;
with me. Do you think you can do this? Of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:07.500
you can, because you are good at English.&nbsp;
Let's say all of these sentences together.&nbsp;

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:15.240
Did you find your coat in the closet? I&nbsp;
enjoy taking walks early in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:24.300
I love to spend summer vacation in the mountains.&nbsp;
Do you have this in a smaller size? Do you believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:32.880
in love at first sight? Oh no. I spilled coffee on&nbsp;
my homework. Do you have a date on Saturday night?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:42.240
I jumped when he tapped me on the shoulder.&nbsp;
The building is on fire. My date was on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:49.680
phone the whole night. It was so rude. My&nbsp;
favorite cafe is at the end of this street.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:59.940
My date will be here at 5:15. We are having dinner&nbsp;
at my favorite restaurant. You can email me at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:06.000
