00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.480
Hello everyone.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.549
I’m Robin and welcome to Beginner 2.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:14.590
Now, Beginner 2 is a little more difficult
than Beginner 1, but that’s ok because my

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.420
videos are very useful.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.520
Very helpful.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.890
They are real English.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.800
So be sure to study them all.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.099
Now, I’m going to give you a few tips or
advice on how to study my videos.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.830
The first thing I want to tell you to do…is
to repeat.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.580
Repeat after me.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.960
Everything I say, you should try to follow
me and say it the same speed and same style

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.960
as I do.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.590
So, for example, if I say “How are you?”,
you should repeat, “How are you?”.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.730
If I say “What do you do?”, you should
repeat “What do you do?”.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.350
Repeating is very important to improving your
English.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.620
Also, most videos have example sentences,
or example dialogues.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.780
Ok…

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.320
These are also very important.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.469
I’m going to teach you a lot of vocabulary
and expressions and the example sentences

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:18.409
and example dialogues will help you understand
how to use them in a sentence.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.070
They’ll also help you with the grammar.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.070
Ok…

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.200
So be sure to focus and study, the example
sentences, example dialogues.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.270
Some videos will have a test.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.930
A listening test.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.930
Ok…

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.090
Be very serious.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.020
These are important tests.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.020
Ok…

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.490
So you should have paper and a pen and when
the test starts, you should listen carefully

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.569
and write down the answer.

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:52.350
Now, if the test is going too fast, stop the
video, ok… slow it down to your speed.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.020
But the test is very important to helping
your listening.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.020
Alright…

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.450
Now, in the videos, I cannot teach you everything.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.439
I did my best to teach you a lot of information,
but it’s not everything.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.439
Ok…

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.110
You’re still going to have a lot of questions…and
you might be confused sometimes.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.140
Ok…

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.959
So you have to do a lot of self-study.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.540
After you watch the video, don’t just rush
to the next video.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.500
You should do a little review.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.410
Ok… and self-study.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.599
Self-study is very important.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.840
I can’t do everything for you.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.820
You can’t learn English just by me.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.840
You also have to self-study and practice it.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.310
Alright, and the last thing I want to say
is don’t give up.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.310
Ok…

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.030
Now, these videos can be a little difficult,
but don’t give up.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.689
If you don’t understand the video, watch
it again…, but don’t give up.

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:49.689
Keep going.

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.720
The only way to improve is if you keep going.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720
Alright….

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.700
And I know, I’m sure, after you watch my
videos, re-watch them twice, your English

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.830
will get better.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.659
This is real English, with real expressions.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:06.659
Ok…

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:13.360
That’s it and I hope you do well.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.959
Good luck.

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.819
Hello everyone.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.819
We are going to talk about basic greetings
for when you meet someone you don’t know.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:26.819
Ok…

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.440
Someone you don’t know is called a stranger.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.579
So, when you meet the stranger, what do you
say?

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.830
Ok..so these are basic greetings.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.260
So, on the board here, I have the first basic
greeting.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.260
“Hi”.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.709
Ok…this is a very casual greeting when you
meet someone for the first time.

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:46.709
“Hi”.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.950
Very simple.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.430
The second one, “Hello”.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.680
Oh, something wrong with the spelling here.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.019
Be careful with the spelling of “hello”.

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.060
Many of my students put the ‘W’.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.499
There is never a ‘w’.

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:04.689
It is only “hello”.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:05.689
Ok…

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:06.810
Be careful with that.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.400
So, of course, these are the most common greetings:
“hi”, “hello”.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.230
And here are three more greetings.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.030
“Good morning”, “good afternoon”,
and “good evening”.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.300
Alright, so these are the most basic greetings
when you meet the stranger.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.020
And when you say “hi”, they will probably
say the same thing.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.020
“Hi”.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.950
If you say “hello”, they will say the
same thing.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.950
“Hello”.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.639
If you say “good morning”, they will say
the same thing.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.830
“Good morning”.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.009
“Good afternoon”.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.199
“Good evening”.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.850
So, if they say “good evening” to you,
you should answer, ”good evening”.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.900
If they say “good morning” to you, you
should answer “good morning”.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.300
Alright…that’s how we do our basic greetings
with a stranger.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.540
Alright, let’s move on to some more greetings.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.810
Ok…so we’re going to look at two more
greetings.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.640
The next one is “how are you?”.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.300
And this one…”how are you doing?.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.710
Ok…both are very common.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.830
You must know them.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.120
“How are you?”.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.110
“How are you doing?”.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.819
“How are you?”.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.740
“How are you doing?”.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.880
So, someone asks you… these questions.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.430
And you would answer, starting with “I’m”.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.520
Ok…

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.520
I am…I’m.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.569
I’m fine.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:32.569
Ok…

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.410
So, I’m fine is the best answer.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.830
It’s the most common answer.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.099
So, you should always try to say, “I’m
fine”.

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.669
“How are you?”

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.690
“I’m fine.”

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.520
There are other answers.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520
“How are you?”

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520
“I’m great.”

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.120
“I’m good.”

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.110
“I’m not bad.”

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.740
“I’m so so.”

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.919
Ok…but be careful with “so so”.

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.449
Many of my students say “so so” too much.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.449
ok…

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.060
So, the best answer is “I’m fine.”

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.190
and sometimes use these.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.550
ok…

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.210
Maybe you’re not fine.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.930
So you want to express something bad.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.930
So…

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.930
“How are you?”

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.930
“I’m bad.”

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.180
or…”How are you?”

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.889
“I’m not good.”

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.220
“How are you doing?”

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.780
“I’m not good.”

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.780
Alright…

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:31.230
So, someone asks the question, you answer
and the polite thing to do is ask them the

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.600
same question.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.070
So, “How are you?”

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.370
“I’m fine.”

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.710
And then we should use one of these.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.410
Ok…”How are you?”

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.710
“I’m fine…..and you?”

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.599
ok..your asking them.

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:44.889
“How are you?”

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.490
“I’m fine….how about you?”

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.259
Ok, these mean the same thing.

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.610
So, you can use this one or this one.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:59.400
Alright…let’s take a look at a few examples…example
dialogues, so we can understand this better.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.009
Alright, let’s look at example dialogue
one.

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:05.180
“Good morning.”

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.780
“Good morning.”

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.240
Let’s look at example dialogue two.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.840
“How are you?”

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.400
“I’m good.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.960
And you?”

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.199
“I’m fine.”

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.560
Let’s look at example dialogue three.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.620
“How are you doing?”

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.560
“Not bad.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.240
What about you?”

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.870
“I’m pretty good.”

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.900
Let’s look at example dialogue four.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.740
“Good afternoon.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.160
How are you?”

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.940
“Very well thank you.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.610
And you?”

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.520
“I’m fine.”

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.970
Ok…I hope you have a good understanding
of how to use basic greetings to someone you

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.259
don’t know.

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:53.540
It’s easy.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.540
Alright…

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.430
Before we go, I want to talk about this expression.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.949
“How are you?”

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:02.099
“I’m fine thank you, and you?”

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:05.389
Of course, every Korean knows this expression.

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:08.000
This is what you were taught in school.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.439
But, of course, this is too common and too
nice; too polite.

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:16.740
So, it’s a little bit funny.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.740
Ok…

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.900
So, “How are you?”

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.490
“I’m fine thank you, and you?”

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.060
Try not to use this.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.060
Ok…

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.090
Let’s make it easier.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:31.580
uhhh, as I said, it’s too nice, so let’s
cut the “thank you”.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.580
Ok…

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.470
So, this sounds better already.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.470
This is much better.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.690
“How are you?”

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.870
“I’m fine, and you?”

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.870
ok…

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.339
That’s better than “I’m fine thank you,
and you?”

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:44.339
Alright…

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:45.839
So, that’s basic greetings.

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:51.760
Uhhh, again I hope you understand and I’ll
see you next video.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.420
Hello everyone.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:03.140
In this video, we’re going to talk about
basic greetings you would use with people

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.589
you know.

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:05.630
With your friends.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.630
Ok…

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.779
Now, let’s take a look.

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:09.149
I have three here.

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:13.470
Now, we would use these in very casual situations.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.470
ok…

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:22.149
We don’t want to use these in business meetings
or meeting some stranger who’s very important.

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:25.760
You want to use this with.. uhhh.. people
we know.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.360
Very friendly people.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.710
Alright…so the first one is “What’s
up?”

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.710
Ok..

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.790
So, “What’s up?”

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.830
you…”What’s up?”

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.690
Ok, don’t look up.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.850
“What’s up?”

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.920
common greeting.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.570
“What’s up?” and “What’s new?”

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.570
Very similar.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.170
So, if someone asks you “What’s up?”

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.460
That’s their…

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.269
kind of asking you “What are you doing now?”

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:52.760
Ok..so it could be “Hey, what’s up?”

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.279
And you would answer, “Oh, I’m going out
for dinner.”

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:57.300
Ok..so “What’s up?

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.990
What are you doing?”

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.209
“Hey, what’s up?”

00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:03.240
“Uhhh, I’m about to go to a party.”

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.930
Ok…

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.589
With “What’s new?”

00:10:07.589 --> 00:10:08.920
“What’s new?”

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.820
uhhhh…. maybe they haven’t see you for
like a week.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.380
Ok, you haven’t met your friend for one
week.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.649
You meet your friend and your friend says,
“Hey, what’s new?”

00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:21.649
Ok…

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:22.649
“What’s new?”

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:24.670
“What’s new in your life?”

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.670
ok…

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.560
“What happened in one week?”

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.730
So, someone asks you, “What’s new?”

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.540
And you would answer, “Well, I made a new
girlfriend.”

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.540
Or…

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.540
“I went to a concert last Friday.”

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.540
ok…

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.410
“So, what’s new with you?”

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.930
“Uhhh, I took a trip to Busan over the weekend.”

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:52.940
Ok…so someone asks, “What’s new?”..kind
of what happened in your life…since they

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.470
last saw you.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.470
Alright…

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.399
And the last one, very friendly expression
here, “How’s it going?”

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:02.240
“How’s it going?”

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240
What is “it”?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240
“How’s it going?”

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.310
Well, “it” is your life.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.139
“How’s your life going?”

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:09.810
Or similar to “How are you?”

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.649
“So how’s your life going?”

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:13.260
“Are you doing well?”

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.920
Uhh, you would answer, you know, if someone
asks, “How’s it going?”

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.200
You would answer, “It’s going great.”

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.820
“It’s going well.”

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.410
“It’s going fine.”

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.410
Ok…

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.520
“How’s it going?”

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.399
“It’s going wonderful.”

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.029
Alright…

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:31.310
So these are the first three.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.500
Let’s take a look at another three.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.660
Alright…so here are three more expressions
you can use when you’re meeting your friend.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.980
Uhhh, the first one…very nice, very polite,
very friendly.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.930
You say, “Good to see you.”

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.410
Ok…”Good to see you.”

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.529
or “Good to see you, again.”

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:54.480
Ok…so you haven’t seen your friend.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.880
You see your friend.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.870
“Hi, good to see you.”

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.420
Ok…that’s very friendly.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.790
Let’s look at the next one.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:07.480
You meet your friend and your friend asks
you, “How are things?”

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.380
“How are things?”

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.100
Ok…what are things?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.720
“How are things?”

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.820
Now, “things”, those are things in your
life.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.880
So, what’s happening in your life?.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880
“How’s your life?”

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.430
Ok…”How are things?”

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.860
So, the “How are things?”, you would answer…

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.260
“Things are great.”

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.730
“Things are good.”

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.350
“Things are fine.”

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.899
Ok…”How are things?”

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:33.709
“Things are wonderful.”

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:34.709
or…

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:36.810
“Things are bad.”

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.480
Ok, so you can express that with “things”…

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.900
“How are things?”

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.350
“Things are so so.”

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.620
And the last one here.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.800
“How’s life?”

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.570
“Hey, how’s life?”

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.750
“How’s life?”, again very friendly.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.300
Asking about your life is your life good,
or is your life bad?

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.680
“How’s life?”

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.300
You could say, “Life is good.”

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.639
“Life is great.”

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:03.200
or…”Life is terrible.”

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.570
Ok… not good.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.959
Ok.. depends on your feeling.

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:10.200
So, these are three more to use with your
friend.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.680
Again, uhhh, not in a business situation,
only with friendly people you know.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.610
Alright, so let’s take a look at some examples
to understand these better.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.029
Alright, so the first example…

00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:26.060
“How’s it going?”

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.420
“I’m good.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.180
How are you?”

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.779
“I’m fine.”

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:32.279
The next example…

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.360
“Hey, what’s up?”

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.750
“Nothing much.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.459
How’s it going?”

00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:40.470
“Fine.”

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.740
And the next example.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.050
“How are things with you?”

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.960
“Things are great!

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960
And you?”

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.960
“I’m pretty good.”

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.690
The next example.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.529
“How’s it going?”

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:53.759
“I’m ok.

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:55.250
How about you?”

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.940
“I’m pretty good these days.”

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.760
And the last example.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.279
“How’s life?”

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:03.649
“Life’s pretty good.

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:04.690
How about you?”

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.070
“Me, too.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.149
Things are great.”

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:09.790
“How are you?”

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.350
Did you understand my example dialogues?

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.760
I hope so.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.790
These are good expressions to use…speaking
in English to your friend.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.220
Alright, you should know them and you should
practice them.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.910
Anyway, that’s it for this video.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:33.420
See you next time.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.420
Hello everyone.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.810
In this video, we are going to talk about
the basic ways to say, “good-bye.”

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:40.810
Alright…

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:46.250
Now, on the board are the three most common
ways to say, “good-bye.”

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.911
You probably already know them.

00:14:47.911 --> 00:14:51.149
The first one, “good-bye.”

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:54.820
Usually, we write this with a hyphen.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.820
Ok…

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.820
“Good-bye.”

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.079
Now, a lot of my students are scared to say,
“good-bye.”

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:05.150
Because they think, “good-bye”, is “good-bye
forever.”

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.150
ok…

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.850
I’ll never meet you again.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.450
uhhh, or, I’m…I’ll meet you in a very
very long time.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.020
That’s not true.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.020
ok…

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.350
“Good-bye” is very common and you can
meet your friend, at the end of the evening,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.800
say, “good-bye.”

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.770
And that doesn’t mean “Good-bye forever.”

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:23.770
Ok…

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.079
So, don’t be scared to say “Good-bye.”

00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:29.760
The next one, of course we shorten it.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.220
Make it short….to “Bye”.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.220
Just “bye”.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.430
Very simple.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.430
Very easy.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.529
Very common.

00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:37.529
“Bye”.

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:38.529
Alright…

00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:42.950
And, of course, in Korea, they like to say,
“bye, bye”.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:43.950
ok…

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.139
A lot of my students always say “bye, bye”.

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:48.380
“Bye, bye”.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.620
“Bye, bye”.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.560
They say it too much.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560
Alright…

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.950
You should say, “bye, bye”, sometimes,
not every time.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:56.950
ok…

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.050
So, try to say “bye” and “good-bye”.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.050
Alright…

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.510
So, these three are the most common.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.010
Let’s move on to ‘see you’.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.410
Ok…let’s look at the ‘see you’ expressions.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.800
Now, “see you” is a very useful and excellent
way to say “good-bye.”

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.140
Now, of course, you can just say very simple,
“see you”.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.140
ok…

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.110
That means “bye”.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.399
You could also say, “see you soon”.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.399
Ok…

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.399
“See you soon.”

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:29.529
We’re going to meet soon.

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:32.040
Maybe later today, or tomorrow.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.690
Anyway the time is short; soon.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:35.690
ok…

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.000
“See you soon”.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.880
“See you later”.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.180
“See you later”.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.180
Ok…

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.740
Now this one is special.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.550
“See you later”.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.250
And many people are confused because, “see
you later”.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.050
What is “later”?

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.570
Now, later today?

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.570
Tomorrow?

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.570
When is later?

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.910
“See you later”.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.100
Alright…

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:03.079
Well, sometimes, people say, “see you later”.

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:05.280
That means later today.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.160
Sometimes, they say, “see you later”.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.960
That doesn’t mean later today.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.900
It means just “good-bye”.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.060
Just “bye”.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.060
ok…

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.860
So this one can be confusing.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:23.670
So, when someone says, “see you later”,
probably you’re not going to meet later.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.670
ok…

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.780
It’s probably just “bye”.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.950
Alright…the last one here, “see you….”.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.160
You could put any time here.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.960
“See you tonight”.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.140
“See you tomorrow”.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.470
“See you on the weekend”.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.630
“See you on Friday”.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.360
“See you next week”.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360
ok…

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.630
Very useful to tell the person, “good-bye”
and when you will see them next.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.630
Alright…

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.880
Let’s move on to a few more examples of
how to say, “good-bye”.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.340
Ok, let’s look at three more here.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.490
This one.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.490
“Cheers”.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.390
Ok, a lot of students are confused because
“cheers” has two meanings.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:13.170
The first meaning, of course…when you’re
drinking beer and you want to celebrate with

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.250
your friends, you hit the glasses…

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.730
you say “cheers”.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:18.730
ok…

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.620
But this meaning is different than that “cheers”.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.880
This meaning is just, “bye”.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.880
Ok…

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.920
so, “cheers”.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.860
That just means “bye”.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.380
Especially in e-mails.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.120
People write their e-mails…at the bottom,
“cheers”.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.300
Ok…

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.470
“Bye”.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.600
The next one, “take care”.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:45.180
“Take care” is a very sweet and friendly
way to say “good-bye”.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.630
You just say, “take care”.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.630
ok…

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.140
A very nice way to say, “good-bye”.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.520
I like it.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.040
“Take care”.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.470
And the last one, “good night”.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.470
Ok…

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.470
“Good night”.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.070
You can only use that at night.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.790
Don’t use it in the day.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:02.840
Only at night.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.520
And usually, late night.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.520
ok…

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:12.340
So, maybe you’re at work, very late, 10
p.m., everyone is going home, “good night”.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.340
ok…

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.510
Again, it just means, “bye”.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.510
Alright…

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.780
So, these are a few more expressions.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.200
Of course, there’s many many more expressions.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.330
This is just a few.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:29.160
Anyway, let’s take a look at a few example
dialogues to help you understand how to use

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.670
these.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.690
Alright, the first example dialogue.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.690
“Good-bye.”

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.800
“ok, see you next time.”

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.220
Example dialogue two.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.580
“Take care, Jack.”

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.540
“ok, you too, Jill.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.090
Bye.”

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.870
Example dialogue three.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.180
“See you later.”

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.780
“Cheers.”

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.020
And…example dialogue four.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.410
“Have a good night.”

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.420
“ok, good night.”

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.150
I hope you understand the examples.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.550
Before we go, I want to talk about these words.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.150
Now, these words are not English.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.150
ok…

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.020
These are other languages.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.500
But all these words mean the same thing, “good-bye”.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.500
ok…

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:30.780
So, in English, sometimes we borrow words
from other languages and we use them to say

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.780
“good-bye”.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.780
Alright…

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:39.500
Now, I’m going to say these words, but I’m
going to say them with English pronunciation.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.500
ok…

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:46.570
So it’s probably not the right pronunciation,
but it’s how we say it in English.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.270
The first word is Italian.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.800
And we’re going to pronounce that as “ciao”.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800
ok…

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.800
So, “ciao”.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.280
So, sometimes we say, “ciao”.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.660
And that just means, “bye”.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.680
The next one, Japanese.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.630
So, with English pronunciation, we say “sainara”.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.820
Ok…

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.200
Again, “bye”.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.120
This is Spanish.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.300
“Adios”.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.490
“Adios”.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.680
“Adios”.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.060
Again, “bye”.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.000
And the last one is French.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.400
“Au revoir.”

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.800
“Au revoir.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.950
Just means “bye”.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:22.950
ok…

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.920
So again, sometimes we say these in English
to our friends.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.940
Alright, so that’s how we say “good-bye”
in English.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.530
I hope you understand.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.840
That’s it.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:44.010
There’s nothing left to say except, “good-bye”.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.010
Hello everyone.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:50.080
In this video, we’re going to talk about
expressions you use when you haven’t

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.890
see someone for a long time.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:53.890
ok…

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:59.360
So, imagine, you’re walking on the street
and then you see your friend and

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.820
you haven’t seen your friend for a long
time.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:09.300
Maybe, you haven’t seen your friend for
a month…or 6 months…or a year…or 5 years..

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.110
or you haven’t seen them for 10 years.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.110
Ok…

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.880
You haven’t seen them for a long time.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.730
So what should you say?

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:27.450
Well, first, you should say “hi” or “hello”,
but then…you should use one of these expressions.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.740
Ok…

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.400
So the first one, “It’s been a long time”.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.070
“It’s been a long time”.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.140
So you can say, “Hey, Susan, how are you
doing?

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.960
It’s been a long time”.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.960
Ok…

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:47.170
So you want to express that you haven’t
seen them for a long time.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.580
The next one.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.910
“It’s been too long”.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.960
“Hey, Jack, how’s it going?

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.700
It’s been too long”.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.700
Ok…

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.110
We haven’t seen each other for a long time.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.870
“It’s been too long”.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.160
If you see, I have the blue line.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.510
We change this to other time…time expressions.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.280
You could say, “It’s been too long”.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.430
You could say, “It’s been one year”.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.920
“It’s been one year”.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.870
“It’s been ten years”.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.740
“It’s been ages”.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.930
“Hey, Stan, how are you doing?

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.070
It’s been ages since we last saw each other.”

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.740
So, ’ages’, a long time.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.890
Ok…

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.640
And the last one here…

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.200
Of course this is the most common one and
the easiest one to use.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.200
“Long time, no see.”

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.670
So, “Hey, Jack.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.990
How are you?

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.920
Long time, no see”.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920
Alright…

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.970
So, again, all of these mean, I haven’t
seen you in a long time.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:53.570
Good to use…when you meet your friend you
haven’t seen in a long time.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.280
Alright…let’s move on to a few more expressions.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:03.260
Ok…Here are two questions to use when you
haven’t seen someone in a long time.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.270
The first one…

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.290
“How long has it been?”

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.290
Ok…

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.860
So, you haven’t met your friend for a long
time, so you say, “Hey, Dave.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.860
How are you doing?

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.450
Haven’t see you in a long time.”

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.720
And he says, “How long has it been?”

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720
Ok…

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.350
So you have to think.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.450
How long have we not seen each other?

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:28.240
So you can say, “It’s been ….two months”.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240
Ok…

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.530
So, we haven’t seen each other for two months.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.690
So, “How long has it been since we last
met?”

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.690
Ok…

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:42.620
“It’s been…” and you have to think,
“Uhmm, about 1 year.”

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.620
Ok…

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.770
The next question.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.910
“What have you been up to?”

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.510
“What have you been up to?”

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:53.300
Now the “up to” is same as “What have
you been doing?”

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.300
Ok…

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.040
“Since we last met, what have you been doing?”
ok…

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.960
So, maybe you didn’t meet your friend for
1 year.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960
ok…

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.810
So, you want to ask, you know, “how long
has it been?

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.590
It’s been 1 year.”

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.990
“What have you been up to?”

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.110
“What have you been doing for 1 year?”

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.110
Ok…

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.660
“Well, I’ve been traveling.”

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.140
“I’ve been working hard.”

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.720
“I’ve been studying English.”

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720
Ok…

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.110
So you want to tell what have you been doing
for that time.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.110
Alright…

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:33.020
So these are two useful questions to use when
you haven’t met your friend for a long time.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.360
Let’s take a look at some example dialogues.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.220
Ok, example dialogue one.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.470
“Hi, Susan.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.610
It’s been a long time.”

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.790
“Hi, Dave.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.990
Yes, it’s been over 2 years.”

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.990
Example two.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.580
“Hello, Mr. Smith.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.700
How long has it been?”

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.230
“About 6 months.”

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.800
“I’m happy to see you again.”

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.950
“Yes, me too.”

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.970
Example dialogue three.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.910
“Jessica, long time no see.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.350
“Hi, Jeff.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.490
What have you been up to?”

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.990
“Well, I got married and moved to France.”

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.300
“Wow, good for you.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.600
I’m so happy to see you again.”

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600
Example four.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600
“Hey, Paul.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.130
It’s been ages since we last met.”

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.770
“Yes, wow, maybe 10 years.”

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.280
“It’s been too long.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.080
I missed you.”

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.250
Ok, I hoped those dialogues helped you.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:38.140
I know these expressions are a little bit
difficult..

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:44.420
a little bit big…a little bit complicated,
but these are excellent expressions to use

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.060
when you haven’t seen someone for a long
time.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.070
Ok…when you haven’t seen your friend for
a long time.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.830
And, also, in the business situation…

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.550
you haven’t seen someone for a long time.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.560
Alright…you should use these.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.680
Well, I hope you can learn them and know them.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.680
Maybe it takes a little more self-study.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.360
Anyway, you can do it.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.470
And I’ll see you next time.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:15.960
Hello, everyone.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.980
In this video we’re going to talk about
your first meeting with a stranger.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.980
Ok..

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.720
A stranger is someone you don’t know.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.920
So, here’s a picture of two people.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.410
They are strangers.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.480
They don’t know each other.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480
Ok…

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.300
So this is their first meeting.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.570
And we have five things we should do in the
first meeting.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:41.790
Do or say.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.050
Uhh…the first thing.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:46.800
What’s the first thing we should say at
the first meeting?

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.800
Ok..

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.920
You meet someone…what’s the first thing
you say…?

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.700
Well, it should, of course, be “hi”.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.970
Or “hello”.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.780
“Hi” or “hello”.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.550
And what’s the second thing you should say?

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.950
“Nice to meet you”….no!

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:04.950
Ok…

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.630
Don’t use “nice to meet you”, second.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:14.540
Before “nice to meet you”, you should
always ask about their name.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.540
Ok…

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.750
You should ask them their name, first.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.760
So, “Hi.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.770
My name is Robin.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.180
What’s your name?”

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.180
Alright…

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:28.760
So, after the name, now you can say, “nice
to meet you.”

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.020
“Nice to meet you.”

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:38.910
Alright…so, it’s very important to have,
“nice to meet you”, after the name.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.910
Ok…

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:41.750
Meeting someone means you know them.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.750
Ok…

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.750
You know their name.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:49.290
So, if you put “nice to meet you”, before
the name, it’s very strange.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.621
And many Koreans do this.

00:28:50.621 --> 00:28:53.180
They say, “hi, nice to meet you.”

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.310
‘We didn’t meet, yet.’

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.310
Ok…

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.410
So you have to give the name.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:58.770
“Hi, I’m Robin.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.600
Nice to meet you.”

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600
Alright…

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.020
What’s the next thing?

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.470
So, this is the greeting.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.470
Ok…

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.070
“Hi”, name, “nice to meet you.”

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.840
And the next thing…

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.970
This is gonna be questions.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:16.990
So, you’re going to start asking questions
to get to know them.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.150
For example, uhhh…

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:20.290
“Where do you live?”

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.170
“Where are you from?”

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.280
“What do you do?”

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.280
Ok…

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.910
You have to start asking questions to know
them better.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.220
And then once you talk… a little while…

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.220
The last step of course is “bye”.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.500
“Good-bye.”

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.340
“See you later.”

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.620
Alright…

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:46.370
So you should follow these steps when you
meet someone, a stranger, for the first time.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:52.770
“Hello”, ask them their name, “nice
to meet you”, ask some questions, and then,

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:53.770
“bye”.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.770
Ok…that’s the process of meeting a stranger
for the first time.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.490
Alright, let’s take a look at an example
dialogue.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.330
Ok, let’s look at this dialogue.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.430
Two people are talking for the first time.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.430
“Hi.”

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:08.430
“Hello.”

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.080
“My name’s Robin.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.440
What’s your name?”

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.900
“My name’s Jack.”

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.040
“Oh, nice to meet you.”

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.340
“Nice to meet you, too.”

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.830
“What do you do?”

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.780
“I’m a student.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.780
And you?”

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.310
“I’m a teacher.”

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.150
“Well, I have to go.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.150
See you again.”

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.480
“Yes, bye.”

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:35.180
Ok, I hope you understand what to say when
you meet someone for the first time.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.580
Alright…you should follow those five steps.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.910
Say “hello”, ask about the name, then
“nice to meet you.”

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:48.820
Remember, don’t say “nice to meet you”
so fast like, like many of my students.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.420
It sounds very strange.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.790
So after “nice to meet you”, then you
can start asking some questions.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.810
And, of course, the ending is always, “bye”.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:03.830
Alright… that’s it for this video.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.800
“Bye.”

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:16.030
Hello, in this video we are going to talk
about four essential questions you should

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.780
know when you first meet someone.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.780
Ok…

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:26.620
Now, I call them essential questions, cause
essential means very important…you must

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.620
know.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.620
Ok…

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.660
Now, probably you already know most of them,
but let’s just review them anyways.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.330
Let’s take a look at the first one.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.400
You think it’s very easy, but maybe you’re
using it wrong.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.740
The first question, “What is your name?”.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.660
“What is your name?”

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.910
Now, probably when you were young, your English
teacher taught you,

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.670
“What is your name?”.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:58.450
…And that’s fine, but you’re not a child
anymore, you’re an adult.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.450
Ok…

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.700
You’ve grown up.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.390
So you shouldn’t say, “What is your name?”

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.390
anymore.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.390
Ok…

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.390
This sounds childish.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.050
“What is your name?”

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.130
Ok…

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.980
An adult….we are going to use a contraction.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.781
“What’s”, ok…”What is…”, we’re
going to change it to “What’s”.

00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:20.781
“What’s your name?”

00:32:20.781 --> 00:32:21.781
Alright…

00:32:21.781 --> 00:32:22.781
This is more common.

00:32:22.781 --> 00:32:23.781
“What’s your name?”

00:32:23.781 --> 00:32:24.781
It’s faster.

00:32:24.781 --> 00:32:25.781
“What’s your name?”

00:32:25.781 --> 00:32:26.781
“What’s your name?”

00:32:26.781 --> 00:32:28.290
Ok, I wrote my name here.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.880
“My name is Robin.”

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.070
Again, this is a little bit childish.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.530
“What’s your name?”

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.250
“My name is Robin.”

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:42.020
“My name is….”, again… you don’t
want to use this style anymore.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.890
Let’s make a contraction.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.120
Make it faster.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.960
“What’s your name?”

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.940
“My name’s Robin.”

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.580
“My name’s…….my name’s Robin.”

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.130
“What’s your name?”

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.070
“My name’s Robin.”

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.660
Alright…this is adult style.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:02.020
Also, for “What’s your name?”, you could
just say, “I’m Robin.”

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.350
This is ok, too.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.240
So, “My name’s Robin.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.670
I’m Robin.”…doesn’t matter.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.130
Both are ok.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.110
Let’s move on to the next question.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.630
Ok, the next question.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.630
Very common.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.630
Very easy.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.100
“Where are you from?”

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.850
“Where are you from?”

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:20.430
Ok…so say it very fast.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.130
“Where are you from?”

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.670
“Where are you from?”

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.750
“Where are you from?”

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.410
“I from Korea.”

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.370
Oh, this is terrible.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.401
So many of my students say, “I from Korea.”

00:33:33.401 --> 00:33:34.510
Don’t!

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.901
Don’t say “I from Korea.”

00:33:36.901 --> 00:33:40.030
Let’s put a line through that.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.030
Bad grammar.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:47.140
“I from Korea.”…no the correct is, “I’m…..I’m
from Korea.”

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.760
I have to hear this ‘m’ sound.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.391
“I’m from Korea.”

00:33:51.391 --> 00:33:52.391
Alright…

00:33:52.391 --> 00:33:53.391
“Where are you from?”

00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:55.080
“Where are you from?”

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.270
“I’m from Korea.”

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.730
Well, I’m not from Korea.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.730
“I’m from Canada.”

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:03.400
Ok, so make sure you can say this question
very fast.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.900
“Where are you from?”

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.900
And make sure you use, ‘I’m’

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.101
“I’m from Korea.”

00:34:09.101 --> 00:34:11.220
Let’s go to the next question.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.810
“Where do you live?”

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.160
That’s our next question.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.730
“Where do you live?”

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.060
Don’t say, “Where are you live?”

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.840
Ok, that is wrong.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.929
The question is, “Where…

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:22.929
do… you… live?”

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.710
“Where do you live?”

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:27.540
“Where do you live?”

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.060
“Where do you live?”

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:35.429
Ok, so, “Where do you live?”, ‘live’
is asking where’s your house…your home.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.190
“Where do you live?”

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.510
So your answer should have your city or area.

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:43.160
So, “Where do you live?”

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.160
First answer here.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.590
“I live Seoul.”

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.639
“I live Seoul.”

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.850
This is wrong!

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.070
Ok, bad grammar.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.070
“Where do you live?”

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.810
“I live Seoul.”, No!

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.210
“Where do you live?”

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:59.440
“I live in…in Seoul.”

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.030
You need the preposition ‘in’.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.070
Always.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.230
You always need ‘in’ Seoul.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.170
“Where do you live?”

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.770
“I live in Seoul.”

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:09.770
Ok…

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:13.840
Uhhh, the last one here…is a short way.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.230
“Where do you live?”

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.840
Ok, you don’t have to say, “I live…”.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.600
You could just start with, “in”.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.660
The preposition ‘in’.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.410
So, “Where do you live?”

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:23.690
“In Seoul.”

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:24.690
Ok…

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:25.690
So, again.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:26.690
“Where do you live?”

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.080
“I live in Seoul.”

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.070
“In Seoul.”

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.890
Never say this.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:32.890
Alright…

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.220
Let’s move on to the last question.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.330
“What do you do?”

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:38.850
“What do you do?”

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.130
Ok, this is asking about ‘job’.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.750
“What do you do every day for work?”

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.490
Ok, “What do you do?”

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:51.200
Now English speakers don’t say, “What…do
…you …do?”

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.290
We say it very fast, we say, “What do you
do?”

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:56.840
“What do you do?”

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.200
“What do you do?”

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.790
Ok, very difficult to hear.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.890
“Whatdayou…this is whatdayou.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.150
Whatdayou do?”

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:05.400
“Whatdayou do?”

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.400
Ok…

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.490
So, I ask to my students, “What do you do?”

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:13.640
And a lot of my students say, “I’m student.”

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.470
“I’m student.”

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.470
This is wrong!

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.520
Ok, this is bad grammar!

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.950
Don’t use, “I’m student.”

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:22.170
“I’m student.”

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.340
“What do you do?”

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.340
“I’m student.”

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.340
Don’t use that.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.790
That’s terrible grammar.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.610
You should use this…and take a look.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.090
“I’m ‘a'”.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:32.090
Ok…

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.480
Don’t forget this…’a’

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.800
“I’m a…”

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.350
It sounds like one word.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.350
“I’m a…”

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.350
“I’m a…”

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:40.350
“What do you do?”

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.700
“I’m a student.”

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.090
“I’m a student.”

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.470
“I’m a student.”

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.470
Ok…

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:46.470
“What do you do?”

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.750
“I’m a student.”

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.940
The next one.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.380
“an…”

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.630
Remember, these words start with vowels.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.610
Vowels, a, e, i, o , u.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:02.020
And words that start with vowels, we should
use ‘an’.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.020
Ok…

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.460
“So, what do you do?”

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.450
“I’m an engineer.”

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.760
“I’m an office worker.”

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.760
Ok…

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.550
Alright, so that’s the last question.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.490
“What do you do?”

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:15.970
So let’s review the questions.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:17.240
The first question.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.200
“What’s your name?”

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.300
“My name is Robin.”

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.300
Second question.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.200
“Where are you from?”

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.740
“I’m from Canada.”

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.020
Third question.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.020
“Where do you live?”

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.700
“I live in Anyang.”

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.700
And the last question.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.460
“What do you do?”

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.610
“I’m a teacher.”

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:41.610
Alright…

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:47.460
So, I hope you understand how to say the questions…also
how to answer the questions.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.680
These are very important questions.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.690
You should know them.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:51.690
That’s it.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:38:00.000
See you next video.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Hello again.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.170
In this video, we’re going to look at some
questions to ask someone to know about their

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.170
family.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:09.170
Ok…

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:12.070
Now, remember, asking about family is a very
personal thing.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:19.140
So, make sure you are very familiar or friendly
with the person before you start asking about

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.140
family.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.800
Now, here are the first two questions and
these are good questions to start with.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.980
They are both ‘Do you..?’

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:27.980
questions.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.980
The first one.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.070
“Do you live alone?”

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.850
Ok, only one person in the house.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.540
“Do you live alone?”

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.880
This is a really good question to ask someone.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:44.041
“Do you live alone?”…because when they
answer…if they answer, “yes”..ohh, then

00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:45.640
you know they’re single.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.330
But, if they answer, “no”.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:53.390
They will probably tell you, “No, I live
with my parents.”

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:57.530
or “No, I live with my husband” or “wife”.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:58.530
Ok…

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:04.110
So you could learn a lot by asking this question…about
who he lives with or what kind of family he

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.640
has.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.000
The second question.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.930
“Do you live with your parents?”

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:11.110
Ok…

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.110
Similar style.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:17.650
“Do you live with your parents?”, and
the person will tell you, “yes” or “no”.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.710
Now, both of these are ‘Do you..?’

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:21.710
questions.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.460
And all ‘Do you..?’

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.220
questions…the easiest way to answer is…

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.620
“Yes, I do.”

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.250
“No, I don’t.”

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.230
Ok…very easy answers.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.680
“Do you live alone?”

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.290
“Yes, I do.”

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.900
“No, I don’t.”

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.000
“Do you live with your parents?”

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.550
“Yes, I do.”

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.090
“No, I don’t.”

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:46.760
Alright…so these are good quick answers,
but these are boring answers.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.760
Ok..

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.560
So, these answers are very easy, but probably
if you say, “Yes, I do.”

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.070
or “No, I don’t.”, you should also give
more information.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.550
“Do you live alone?”

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.080
“No, I don’t.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.330
I live with my parents.”

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:07.730
“Do you live with your parents?”

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.870
“Yes, I do.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.340
We live in Chamsil.”

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:18.360
Ok..so, these are good ways to answer quickly,
but you should try to give more information.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.520
Alright, let’s move on to the next questions.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:27.780
Ok, so the next question is very common and
very important.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:33.580
This is the question you want to ask to know
about their brothers and sisters.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.860
And here is the question.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:41.370
“Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:45.330
“Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.330
Ok…

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.330
Again, it’s a “Do you…?”

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.330
question.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:53.780
So the simple answer is “Yes, I do.”,
“No, I don’t.”

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.650
But that’s not enough information.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:59.630
Ok, so here is the best answer.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:03.800
“Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:14.000
So…”Yes, I have one brother”, “one
sister”, “two bothers”, “two sisters”.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.020
Ok…because it’s two, remember we need
that ‘s’.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.740
“Two brothers.”

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.450
“Two sisters.”

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.640
“Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.610
“Yes, I have two sisters.”

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:33.430
Or, you could say, “I have one brother and
two sisters”.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:37.490
Or “I have one brother and three sisters”.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.010
Ok…but remember the single and the plural.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.010
Alright…

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.750
So, this is the best way to answer.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.350
“Yes, I have one brother”.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.980
Some people…uhhh…”no”, ok… you are
single.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.510
You have no brothers or sisters.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:57.500
“Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.750
“No, I’m an only child.”

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.240
“No, I’m an only child.”

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.400
“I’m an only child.”

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.400
Ok…

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:13.470
So this is what you would say, in English,
to say that you have no brothers or sisters.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.470
Ok…

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.660
Let’s move on to the next questions.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.000
“Are you single?”

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.950
“Are you married?”

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.350
These our next two questions.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.670
Very important questions to ask someone.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.670
Alright…

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:29.410
So, it’s very important to know if they’re
single or married.

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:31.490
So, again, “Are you single?”

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.990
Is that person alone?…only one?

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.750
“Are you married?”

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.960
“Do you have a husband?”

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.960
or “wife?”.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.960
Ok…

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.060
Now, they are “Are you…?”

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.970
questions, so all “Are you…?”

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:48.780
questions, we have to answer, “Yes, I am.”,
“No, I’m not.”

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.780
Ok…

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:53.310
Some people say, “Yes, I’m.”

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.310
This is wrong.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.300
You can’t use a contraction here.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.220
It has to be “I am.”

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.870
Never say, “Yes, I’m”.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:01.090
That is wrong.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:03.560
It is only, “Yes, I am.”

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.080
“Yes, I am.”

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.610
“No, I’m not.”

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.640
Ok, so let’s practice..

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.660
fast…speaking fast.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.960
“Are you single?”

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.180
“Yes, I am.”

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.840
“Are you married?”

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.420
“No, I’m not.”

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.100
“Are you single?”

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.630
“No, I’m not.”

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:21.820
“Are you married?”

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.680
“Yes, I am.”

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.680
Ok…

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.020
So those are these two questions.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.830
Let’s move on to the last question.

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:31.660
Ok, we’re at the last question.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.940
“Do you have any children?”

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.120
“Do you have any children?”

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:40.550
Now, probably, the first question is, “Are
you married?”

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:41.550
“Yes, I am.”

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.120
Then you would ask, “Do you have any children?”

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.810
“Do you have any children?”

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:51.480
Now this is similar style to, “Do you have
any brothers or sisters?”

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.790
“Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.060
“Do you have any children?”

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.670
Same style answer.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:01.060
“Yes, I have one son.”

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.580
“Yes, I have one daughter.”

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.660
“Yes, I have two sons.”

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.060
“Yes, I have two daughters.”

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.530
So, remember, “one son”, “two sons”.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.150
Don’t forget the ‘s’.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:16.610
“Two sons.”

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.330
“Two daughters.”

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:24.480
Of course, you could also say, “Yes, I have
one daughter and one son.”

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.380
Or…”I have three daughters and two sons.”

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.050
Ok…you can say many things.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.280
uhhh, some people have no children.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.270
So, “Do you have any children?”

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:38.330
“No, I don’t have any, yet.”

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:40.700
Ok, “I don’t have any, yet.”

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.440
“Do you have any children?”

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.070
“No, I don’t have any, yet.”

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:46.070
Alright…

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.350
So this is the question you want to ask about
children.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:53.410
Alright, so we learned a lot of questions
to ask people about their family.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:59.080
Remember, these are kind of personal questions,
so make sure it’s ok…make sure you’re

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.080
friendly first.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.480
Alright, so, you should practice these questions.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.180
These questions are common and very useful.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:13.120
That’s it.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.080
See you next video.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.080
Hello everyone.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.630
In this video, we are going to talk about
personal question.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:21.630
Ok…

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.860
Now, you have to be very careful asking someone
personal questions.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:33.560
Ok, if you ask them too soon…ok…maybe
you don’t know each other very well, yet,

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:39.100
and you ask the questions too soon, they might
be a little bit upset or angry.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.130
You got to be careful asking these questions.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:43.230
Make sure you’re friendly.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:45.540
Now, the first one I’m going to start with…

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.500
“How old are you?”

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.500
Ok…

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:53.730
As we know in Korea…it’s very important
to know about age.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:46:00.040
So, when you meet someone for the first time,
uhhh, you want to know their age…how old

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.040
they are.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:07.180
But, again, this is kind of a personal question,
so it shouldn’t be one of the first questions.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.180
Ok…

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:13.980
You should talk a little bit with the person
and then when you feel the time is right,

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.000
or it’s ok, then ask this question.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Ok…

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.570
Don’t ask this question too soon.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.570
Anyway, let’s take a look at the question.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:24.880
“How old are you?”

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.510
“How old are you?”

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.540
“How old are you?”

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:33.030
And…some of my students say, “my old is
twenty-two.”

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.180
“My old is twenty-two.”

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.240
Of course, this is bad grammar.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.740
You cannot say, “my old is twenty-two.”

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.730
That’s wrong.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.820
“I’m twenty-two years old.”

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.900
Ok, this is a full sentence.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.400
“How old are you?”

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.280
“I’m twenty-two years old.”

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:57.190
Uhhh, probably your teacher taught you this
way.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:00.170
But, this is kind of childish.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:01.960
“How old are you?”

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.090
“I’m twenty-two years old.”

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:05.090
Ok..

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:09.180
As an adult, uhhh, we’re probably going
to say it a little bit quicker.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.180
We’re going to say this:

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.790
“How old are you?”

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:13.790
“I’m twenty-two.”

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:14.790
Ok…

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:17.540
So, this is…the best way.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:21.030
The easiest way… and the most common way.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.030
Ok…

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:23.580
“How old are you?”

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.610
“I’m twenty-two.”

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.220
Use this.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.700
This is ok, but this is better.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.960
And certainly, never use this.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.910
Alright, let’s move on to the next question.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:33.910
ok, that’s our next question.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:34.910
Very personal, private question.

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:35.910
Again, don’t say it too soon.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:36.910
“Do you have a boyfriend?”

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:37.910
“Do you have a girlfriend?”

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:38.910
Ok…

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.580
Depends who you’re talking to.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.920
“Do you have a boyfriend?”

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.460
“Do you have a girlfriend?”

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.720
Ok, you want to know.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.080
This is a “Do you…?”

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.080
question.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.080
“Do you…?”

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.080
So the answer’s very easy.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.080
“Yes, I do.”

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.080
“No, I don’t.”

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.170
“Do you have a boyfriend?”

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.510
“Yes, I do.”

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:56.570
“Do you have a girlfriend?”

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:57.980
“Yes, I do.”

00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.890
“Do you have a boyfriend?”

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:00.890
“No, I don’t.”

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:01.890
“Do you have a girlfriend?”

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:03.300
“No, I don’t.”

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.300
Alright…

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.720
Be sure to use ‘a’.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.320
Don’t say, “Do you have boyfriend?”

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.000
Ok, this is very important.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.580
“Do you have a boyfriend?”

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.580
Alright…

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.850
“Do you have a girlfriend?”

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:18.410
“Do you have boyfriend?”

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.320
“Do you have a girlfriend?”

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.340
Alright, again…little bit personal question.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.840
Don’t ask it too soon.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.450
Let’s move on to the next question.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:31.100
The next question is a fun question to ask
someone.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.400
“What’s your blood type?”

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.430
“What’s your blood…?”, this is pronounced,
“blood”.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.790
That’s your 비…blood.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.520
“What’s your blood type?”

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.810
Ok…

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.450
Very easy to answer.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:47.110
“What’s your blood type?”

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.790
“It’s ‘A’.”

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.470
“It’s ‘B’.”

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.150
“It’s ‘AB’.”

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.830
“It’s ‘O’.”

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.220
“What’s your blood type?”

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.280
Alright…

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.960
What do you think my blood type is?

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:06.530
Well, my blood type is…not ‘B’…not
‘A’…not ‘O’.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.810
“It’s ‘AB’.”

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:12.070
Yes, that’s my blood type.

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:20.840
So, I understand ‘AB’ means genius or
psycho…uhhh…hmmm…which one am I?

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:26.490
Well, anyway, it’s a fun question to ask
someone, but make sure you know that person

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:27.490
well.

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:30.100
Last move on to the last question.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.880
Here’s the last question I want to talk
about in this video.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.940
Well, first, look at this question.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.640
“What’s your hobby?”

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.350
Ok, that’s an ok question, “What’s your
hobby?”

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:46.000
,but in my opinion, this question is stupid.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.170
Ok, so, I’m going to say that’s a stupid
question to ask.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:53.490
Don’t ask that question.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.990
“What’s your hobby?”

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:58.780
Instead, this is a better question.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.380
Ok…and this is more common.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.670
“What do you do in your free time?”

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.620
“What do you do in your free time?”

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:11.440
Ok, so that’s better than asking, “What’s
your hobby?”

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.560
That’s kind of old style.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.030
This is more common.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.030
Better.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.810
“What do you do…?

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.580
What do you do…in your free time?”

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.580
Alright…

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.060
Very easy to answer.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:27.130
“I like to…”, and then you would put
a verb.

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:28.130
Ok…

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.500
“I like to play computer games.”

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.320
“I like to shop.”

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.110
“I like to exercise.”

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:39.550
“I like to go meet my friends.”

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:42.970
“I like to chat on the internet.”

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.790
“I like to drink soju.”

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:47.960
ok…very easy to answer.

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.560
“What do you do in your free time?”

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.050
“Hey, what do you do in your free time?”

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.920
“I like to study English.”

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.920
Alright…

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:00.550
So, we learned a few personal questions in
this video.

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:05.900
They’re good questions to ask…to get to
know someone and some of them are very fun.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:13.160
But, again, they’re personal questions,
so, ahhh, be careful when asking the questions

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.950
because the person maybe doesn’t want to
answer these questions.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:19.070
Alright, so that’s it.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:22.280
See you next video.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:27.940
Hello, students.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.730
In this video, we’re going to talk about
“Do you…?”

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:32.730
and “Are you…?”

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:33.730
questions.

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:34.730
Now, “Do you…?”

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:35.730
and “Are you…?”

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.570
questions are very useful.

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:43.200
You should know them…because once you know
how to ask questions with “Do you…?”

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:48.040
and “Are you…?”, you can ask many many
questions very quickly.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.000
Let’s look at “Do you…?”

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
questions first.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.510
And I have two styles here.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.680
The first style, “Do you like…?”

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.960
Ok, very simple.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.820
“Do you like…?”

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.510
So you would put anything here.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:02.170
“Do you like Korea?”

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:04.590
“Do you like kimchi?”

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.510
“Do you like soju?”

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:09.560
“Do you like ice-cream?”

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.160
“Do you like handsome guys?”

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.640
“Do you like sexy girls?”

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:21.010
Ok, you can ask so many questions with “Do
you like…?”

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:22.050
The next style.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:23.420
“Do you like to…?”

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.420
Ok…

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.480
No, they’re the same, but we’re adding
‘to’.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.090
“Do you like to…?”

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:33.420
Ok, this is…means we’re going to have
some sort of verb.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.230
Some sort of action word.

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.290
So for example, “Do you like to ski?”

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:42.370
“Do you like to exercise?”

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:46.880
“Do you like to play computer games?”

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.970
“Do you like to drink?”

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:52.750
Ok, they’re many things you could put here.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.500
uhhh, action, something…they’re doing
something.

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.950
“Do you like to swim?”

00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:00.170
“Do you like to ride a bicycle?”

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:03.920
Alright, that’s “Do you like…?”, “Do
you like to…?”

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.200
Very useful for asking question very quickly.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.260
Alright, now if someone asks you these questions.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.090
The “Do you…?”

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:14.090
questions.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.310
With “Do you…?”

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:16.880
questions…very easy answer.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.640
Ok, “Do you like pizza?”

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.930
Look down here.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:23.930
You could say, “Yes, I do.”

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:26.240
or “No, I don’t.”

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.530
“Do you like pizza?”

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.140
“Yes, I do.”

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.750
“No, I don’t.”

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:31.750
Alright…

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:32.850
Very easy to answer.

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:37.480
Ok, so very easy to ask, very easy to answer.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.910
You should know how to ask “Do you…?”

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:40.910
questions.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.180
Let’s move on to the “Are you…?”

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.180
questions.

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.160
Ok, here are the “Are you…?”

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.160
questions.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.160
The “Are you…?”

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.480
questions are very easy to use and very useful,
also.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.330
Ok, let’s take a look.

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.990
So, “Are you hungry?”

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:56.710
“Are you hungry?”

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.440
“Are you tired?”

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:03.040
Ok, these two are asking about the condition
of the person.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.300
“Are you hungry?”

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.440
“Are you tired?”

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.690
“Are you having fun?”

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:12.190
Ok, you want to know how they are feeling..

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:13.320
their condition.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.030
Their body condition.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.030
The next two.

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:17.350
“Are you happy?”

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:18.830
“Are you angry?”

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:22.350
Alright, you’re asking about their emotion…their
feeling.

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:24.220
“Are you happy?”

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:26.080
“Are you angry?”

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.950
“Are you scared?”

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:31.550
Alright, you want to know their emotional
feeling.

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:33.380
So, the “Are you…?”

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:40.160
question is very good to know how the person’s
condition.. and how they are feeling.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.040
Alright, if someone asks you…”Are you…?”

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.040
question.

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.560
This is how you answer.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.190
So, “Are you hungry?”

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.620
“Yes, I am.”

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.070
“Are you tired?”

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.970
“No, I’m not.”

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:56.770
Ok, don’t confuse the “Do you…?”

00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:57.900
and “Are you…?”

00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:58.900
questions.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.910
Ok, sometimes, uhhh, my students confuse them.

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:02.990
The “Do you…?”

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:06.770
questions, “Yes, I do.”, “No, I don’t.”

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:07.810
The “Are you…?”

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:10.619
questions, “Yes, I am.”, “No, I’m
not.”

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:13.200
Ok, you got to be very careful.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.090
Don’t confuse them.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.530
So, that’s the “Are you…?”

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:18.530
questions.

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:19.550
Uhhh, so the “Do you…?”

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:20.750
and “Are you…?”

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:26.680
questions…very useful to know them right
away because you can ask a lot of questions,

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:31.680
in English, to a native speaker…so many
questions…ok…

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.900
So learn them and practice them.

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:42.190
That’s it for this video.

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:43.190
Hello everyone.

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:47.310
In this video, I’m going to talk about how
to introduce your friends.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:51.610
So you have to introduce one friend to another
friend.

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:53.330
And it’s very easy.

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:55.000
Let’s take a look.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.690
Here is me, Robin.

00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.230
And I have two friends.

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:02.369
Mike’s a good friend and Sally is also my
friend.

00:56:02.369 --> 00:56:04.440
They are my friends.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:09.510
But, Mike and Sally…they don’t know each
other.

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:11.369
Ok, they are strangers.

00:56:11.369 --> 00:56:14.190
So, I have to introduce them.

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:21.690
So, I would probably say, “Mike, let me
introduce my friend.

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:24.980
Mike this is Sally.

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.770
Sally this is Mike.”

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:28.770
Ok…

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:29.770
One more time.

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:33.020
“Mike this is Sally.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.570
Sally this is Mike.”

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:36.570
Ok…

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:37.890
I introduced them.

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:42.500
So, once I introduce them, probably they’re
doing to start talking to each other.

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:47.050
They’ll probably say, “Nice to meet you.”,
“Nice to meet you, too.”

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:48.790
And maybe ask some questions.

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:49.790
Ok…

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:52.030
That’s it for introducing a friend.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:56.050
Let’s take a look at a dialogue, so we understand
it better.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:58.330
Alright, the first dialogue.

00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.710
“Hello, June.

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:02.300
Let me introduce my friend.

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:04.520
Steve, this is June.

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.000
June, this is Steve.”

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.910
“Nice to meet you.”

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:12.040
“Nice to meet you, too.”

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.560
The second dialogue.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.900
“Hey, Jack.”

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.240
“Hi, Robin.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.580
Who’s this?”

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.870
“Oh, let me introduce my friend.

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:23.230
Jack, this is Jessica.

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:25.300
Jessica, this is Jack.”

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.080
“Nice to meet you.”

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.840
“Nice to meet you, too.”

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.400
I hope you understand the dialogue.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.480
Uhhh, it’s very easy to introduce your friend.

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:40.830
And I hope one day, I can introduce you to
my friends and you can introduce me to your

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:41.830
friends.

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:42.830
Ok…

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:45.100
Anyway, that’s it for this video.

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:52.880
See you next video.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.880
Hello everyone.

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:58.690
My name is Robin and welcome to the first
video in the numbers series.

00:57:58.690 --> 00:57:59.690
Alright…

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:03.340
Now, what we’re going to talk about English
numbers, today.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:09.400
And if you already know about English numbers,
that’s ok because this video is an excellent

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.400
review.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:15.380
Ahhh, if you don’t know about English numbers,
it’s time to learn.

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.380
Alright…

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.810
So, let’s take a look.

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.750
The first one here.

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:20.880
“Zero.”

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:25.830
And if you notice next to zero, it has another
name, “oh.”

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:33.190
Now, a lot of native speakers say, “zero”,
but more native speakers will just say, “oh”.

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:34.190
Ok…

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:40.130
So this is very confusing to Korean students…because
when I say, “zero”, X

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:46.000
When I say it as “oh”, many of my students
hear “오”, and they don’t think of

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.340
this number…they think of this number…five.

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:53.100
Because in Korean, “오” means five.

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.100
Ok…

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.180
So you got to be very careful.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.230
In English, “oh” means zero.

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:01.230
Ok…

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:03.310
Let’s move on to the next numbers.

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:04.930
They’re a little bit easier.

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:09.170
Ahhh, listen to my pronunciation of each number.

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.710
ok, so the first one.

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:14.700
“One.”

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.690
“Two.”

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.670
“Three.”

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:20.660
“Four.”

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.650
“Five.”

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:24.630
“Six.”

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:26.619
“Seven.”

00:59:26.619 --> 00:59:28.609
“Eight.”

00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:30.600
“Nine.”

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.600
and “Ten.”

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.970
Ok, so one more time.

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:35.200
“One.”

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.430
“Two.”

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:37.660
“Three.”

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:38.890
“Four.”

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:40.119
“Five.”

00:59:40.119 --> 00:59:41.350
“Six.”

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:42.580
“Seven.”

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:43.810
“Eight.”

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:45.040
“Nine.”

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.270
“Ten.”

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:52.630
Alright, and don’t forget “zero”, and
“oh”.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:53.650
Ok…

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:57.300
Let’s move on to the next set of numbers.

00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.760
Ok, let’s continue on with our numbers.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.090
I have the next set here.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:06.200
Eleven until twenty.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.240
Alright…

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.310
So, “eleven”

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:10.350
“Twelve.”

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.380
“Thirteen.”

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.420
“Fourteen.”

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.460
“Fifteen.”

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.490
“Sixteen.”

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:15.530
“Seventeen.”

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:16.570
“Eighteen.”

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:17.609
“Nineteen.”

01:00:17.609 --> 01:00:18.609
and “Twenty.”

01:00:18.609 --> 01:00:25.400
Now, as you can see, I put the red line here
on these ones cause these are the ‘teens’.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
ok…

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400
“Thirteen.”

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400
“Fourteen.”

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400
“Fifteen.”

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400
“Sixteen.”

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400
“Seventeen.”

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400
“Eighteen.”

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400
“Nineteen.”

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400
Alright…

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.660
So you got to be very careful with the teens
because look at this.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.660
“Twenty.”

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:44.220
“Teen” and “..ty”, sound very similar.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.170
So, it can be confusing.

01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:50.010
So this has to be, “teen.”.. and “..ty.”

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:53.230
So, “Nineteen” and “Twenty.”

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:57.490
Ok, there’s one more problem I want to talk
about.

01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:59.880
That is “twelve” and “twenty.”

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.650
A lot of my students confuse the numbers twelve
and twenty.

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:06.100
Be very careful.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.109
This is “twelve.”

01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:09.240
“Twelve.”

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.410
And this is “twenty.”

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:13.310
Don’t confuse those numbers, please.

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:18.090
Alright, let’s go through the pronunciation
one more time.

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:20.290
“Eleven”

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:22.500
“Twelve.”

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.700
“Thirteen.”

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.910
“Fourteen.”

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:29.109
“Fifteen.”

01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:31.310
“Sixteen.”

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:33.520
“Seventeen.”

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.720
“Eighteen.”

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.930
“Nineteen.”

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:38.930
and “Twenty.”

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:42.680
Ok, let’s move on to some bigger numbers.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:48.960
Ok, let’s continue with the numbers from
twenty to one hundred.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.820
We’ve already studied twenty.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:55.090
Well, what comes after twenty?

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:56.760
“Twenty-one.”

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.640
And we can see how I spell it, twenty, and
we have to put this.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.310
This is a hyphen.

01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:04.460
One.

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:05.619
“Twenty-one.”

01:02:05.619 --> 01:02:07.900
And after “Twenty-one.”…

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.900
“Twenty-two.”

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.140
Again, with the hyphen.

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.780
And after “Twenty-two.”…

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:15.270
“Twenty-three.”

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:16.760
“Twenty-four.”

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.250
“Twenty-five.”

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:19.740
“Twenty-six.”

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.230
“Twenty-seven.”

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:22.720
“Twenty-eight.”

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.210
“Twenty-nine.”

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.710
“Thirty.”

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:28.840
And then it continues again…

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.080
“Thirty-one.”

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.320
“Thirty-two.”

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.550
“Thirty-three.”

01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:34.690
All the way to “forty.”

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:36.000
And then, “forty-one.”

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
“Forty-two.”

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.940
It continues this until “one hundred.”

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.940
Ok…

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.171
So, let’s just focus on the tens right now.

01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:45.771
Now the first two, we already know.

01:02:45.771 --> 01:02:48.510
We know “ten” and “twenty”.

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:50.120
Now, let’s take a look at these.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.099
So, of course…

01:02:52.099 --> 01:02:53.780
“Thirty.”

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.460
“Forty.”

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.150
“Fifty.”

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.830
“Sixty.”

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:00.510
“Seventy.”

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.190
“Eighty.”

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.880
“Ninety.”

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.240
“One hundred.”

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:13.660
Ok, this is “One hundred”, but it could
also be pronounced, “a hundred.”

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:14.660
Ok…

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.750
Both are ok.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:19.160
Ahhh, I want to talk about “forty” again.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:25.440
Now the spelling of ‘forty’… a lot of
my students see the ‘four’, so when they

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:31.500
spell ‘forty’, the spell it f-o-u-r-t-y.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.080
This is wrong.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.790
Ok, you have to spell it f-o-r-t-y.

01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:37.630
That’s ‘forty’.

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:38.630
Alright…

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:42.940
So, that’s the numbers from ‘twenty’
to ‘one hundred’.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:47.670
Let’s do some extra pronunciation practice
right now.

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:52.940
Alright, I know you need extra practice with
these numbers.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.940
Ok…

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:59.940
These numbers are difficult and confusing
because they sound very similar.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:04.619
And a lot of my students have problems pronouncing
these numbers correctly.

01:04:04.619 --> 01:04:08.300
…and it makes me confused, sometimes.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.300
Alright…

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.340
And I have one story.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:17.080
Ahhh, a few years ago, I made an appointment,
or actually a date with a girl.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:20.070
And we were supposed to meet at five-fifty.

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:23.730
That’s what she told me, “Let’s meet
at five-fifty.”

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:30.000
So, I went to the meeting place at five-fifty,
but she wasn’t there.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Ok…

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.570
So I waited and waited, she never came.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.950
And then the next time I saw here, I said
to her, “You know, why didn’t you show

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:38.950
up?

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:40.200
I was waiting at five-fifty.”

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.160
And she said, “Yeah, I was waiting there,
too, but you never came.”

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.220
And I was very confused.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:55.990
Well, it turns out that she said, “Five-fifteen.”,
but it sounded, to me, like, “five-fifty.”

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.990
Ok…

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.470
So we were both confused of the time.

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:04.510
While she was there at five-fifteen, I was
there at five-fifty and we never met.

01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:05.510
Ok…

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:12.310
So, it’s very important to get the numbers
right…and don’t confuse them.

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:14.340
So, let’s review.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.500
Of course, these are the ‘teens’.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.390
So, this is “Thirteen.”

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:21.510
And this is “Thirty.”

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:23.140
“Thirteen.”

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.770
“Thirty.”

01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:26.410
“Fourteen.”

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.040
“Forty.”

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.670
“Fifteen.”

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:31.300
“Fifty.”

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.940
“Sixteen.”

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.570
“Sixty.”

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:36.200
“Seventeen.”

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.830
“Seventy.”

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.470
“Eighteen.”

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:41.099
“Eighty.”

01:05:41.099 --> 01:05:42.730
“Nineteen.”

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:44.359
“Ninety.”

01:05:44.359 --> 01:05:46.000
Ok…

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.390
Make sure you get those right and pronounce
them correctly, so you don’t have confusion,

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:52.460
like me.

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:58.250
Alright, ahhh…before we go, we’re going
to do….. a listening test with numbers.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:02.720
So you should get a pen and some paper…and
listen carefully.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.320
I’m going to say the number.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.310
You should write down the number.

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:08.540
Good luck.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:14.260
Alright, so for this test, you should have
some paper or something just to write down…what

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.260
you hear.

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:20.780
So, I’m going to say a number and you should
think of that number or write that number

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.780
down.

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.560
Alright, let’s start.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.830
Number one.

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:27.490
The first number is “seven.”

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:28.869
“Seven.”

01:06:28.869 --> 01:06:33.010
Ok, that’s easy.

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:35.520
You should have this.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.599
Number two.

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:39.470
“Thirteen.”

01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:41.349
“Thirteen.”

01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:45.700
Ok, so it’s thirteen.

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.830
Number three.

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:49.680
“Seventy-five.”

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.530
“Seventy-five.”

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:56.480
Ok, so that’s a big number: seventy-five.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.349
Number four.

01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:59.740
“Twenty.”

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.140
“Twenty.”

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:06.680
Ok, you should write this: twenty.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.760
And number five.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.140
“Nineteen.”

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.520
“Nineteen.”

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.990
Ok, looks like this.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.430
And number six.

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:19.990
“Sixty-six.”

01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:21.550
“Sixty-six.”

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:25.940
Ok, so this is sixty-six.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:29.690
Number seven.

01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:31.570
“Thirty-three.”

01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:33.450
“Thirty-three.”

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:37.810
Ok, you should write: thirty-three.

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:39.859
Number eight.

01:07:39.859 --> 01:07:41.590
“Ninety.”

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:43.320
“Ninety.”

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:47.940
Ok, so this is ninety.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.230
Number nine.

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:52.210
“Twelve.”

01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:54.190
“Twelve.”

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:58.710
Ok, you should write: twelve.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.310
And the last one.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.230
Listen carefully.

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:04.160
“Twenty-One.”

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.090
“Twenty-One.”

01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:12.400
Alright, so you should write: twenty-one.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.390
I hope you did well on the listening test.

01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:16.390
Ok…

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:20.150
So these are the basic numbers from one to
one hundred.

01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:26.440
You have to know how to say these numbers…you
should know how to write these numbers.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:31.810
And I hope this video helps you, but, of course,
this video is not enough.

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:37.581
You have to do self-study and practice these
numbers a lot to make sure you know them well.

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:38.581
Alright…

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:41.440
Well anyway, that’s it for this video.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.480
See you next time.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:50.480
Ok, hello everyone.

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.509
We already practiced the numbers one to one
hundred.

01:08:54.509 --> 01:08:55.509
Alright…

01:08:55.509 --> 01:08:56.859
Those are the basic numbers.

01:08:56.859 --> 01:09:00.880
We’re getting into some more difficult numbers.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.880
Bigger numbers.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.589
Ahhh, don’t be scared.

01:09:03.589 --> 01:09:07.940
I will try to explain it as simple as possible.

01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:11.660
Please listen carefully and good luck.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.130
Here we go.

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:16.109
So, I wrote the numbers here.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:19.200
And…let’s start with the first three.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.290
We already know the first three.

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:22.290
“One.”

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:23.290
“Ten.”

01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:24.290
“One hundred.”

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:25.290
Ok…

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:26.589
So, that’s the easy part.

01:09:26.589 --> 01:09:29.880
Now, it’s going to get a little more confusing.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.370
So I will try to make it simple.

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:34.910
Let’s look at the next number here.

01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:37.529
Ahhh, this is “one thousand.”

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:38.529
Ok…

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:40.420
So we have three zeros.

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.750
Three zeros.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:43.820
That is “a thousand.”

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:47.100
And…every three zeros, we usually use a
comma.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.380
So one, comma, three numbers.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.630
Three zeros.

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:53.130
“One thousand.”

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:54.920
So three zeros is a thousand.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.400
Let’s move on to the next number.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.370
We have the three zeros again.

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:02.280
‘Thousand’, we know that’s “a thousand.”

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.320
What’s this number?

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.320
“Ten.”

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.360
“Ten thousand.”

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.720
“One thousand.”

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.070
“Ten thousand.”

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:11.170
Let’s move to the next…

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:14.260
Ok, we know this is ‘thousand’.

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.740
“One hundred thousand.”

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.740
Ok…

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.540
So, “One thousand.”

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.940
“Ten thousand.”

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.800
“One hundred thousand.”

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.580
Let’s move on to a really big number.

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:31.430
Now, the three zeros here…I underlined with
blue.

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:33.460
Cause that’s a ‘thousand’.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.040
But if you look here, these are red.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.520
Cause, they’re not a ‘thousand’ anymore.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.210
We have three zeros and three zeros.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:44.500
This is now, “a million.”

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.880
So if you see six zeros, that’s “a million.”

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.680
So, we have “one million.”

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.680
Ok…

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.460
Let’s move down.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.350
“Ten million.”

01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:57.350
Alright…

01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:59.790
So, don’t be confused.

01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:02.140
Let’s go through this again.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:03.140
“One.”

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.140
“Ten.”

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.730
“One hundred.”

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:07.520
“One thousand.”

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.310
“Ten thousand.”

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:11.790
“One hundred thousand.”

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:14.960
“One million.”

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.130
and “Ten million.”

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:18.230
Ok…

01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:19.770
I know it’s difficult.

01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:21.000
It take a lot of practice.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.800
So let’s go do some practice right now.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.750
Ok, so I have seven numbers here for us to
practice how to say them.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.670
So, let’s take a look.

01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:34.170
The first one.

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.360
Very easy.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.040
We have two zeros here.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.510
This is simply, “Five hundred.”

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:40.510
Ok…

01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:42.490
Let’s move to number two.

01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:47.920
Now, number two, we can see, we have the three
zeros here.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.770
And I told you, that means thousand.

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:53.410
So this is “seven thousand.”

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.480
Ok…

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.630
Number three.

01:11:56.630 --> 01:12:00.670
Again, we have three zeros here.

01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:02.890
“Fifteen thousand.”

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:05.120
“Seven thousand.”

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.340
“Fifteen thousand.”

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:10.730
Let’s look at the next one.

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:11.730
Three zeros.

01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:14.080
We know this is ‘thousand’.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.150
This is “Twenty-five thousand.”

01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:17.150
Alright…

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:20.650
Let’s go to a bigger number.

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:21.650
Lots of zeros here.

01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:24.890
Ok, so we know this is ‘a thousand’.

01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:26.570
And we have more zeros here.

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:28.740
But it’s not three zeros.

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:33.239
So, this is just a thousand and this is two
hundred.

01:12:33.239 --> 01:12:34.239
Ok…

01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:35.940
“Two hundred thousand.”

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.600
Let’s go to a bigger number.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:44.090
Now we have…three zeros…three zeros.

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:47.870
So, this is no longer ‘thousand’.

01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:50.120
This is now, ‘million’.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.960
“Seven million.”

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.960
Ok…

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.820
Let’s go to a bigger number.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:56.989
Three zeros.

01:12:56.989 --> 01:12:58.080
Three zeros.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.280
“Eighteen million.”

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.980
Ok, so one more time.

01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.690
“Five hundred.”

01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:06.400
“Seven thousand.”

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.120
“Fifteen thousand.”

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.830
“Twenty-five thousand.”

01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:12.260
“Two hundred thousand.”

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.300
“Seven million.”

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.340
“Eighteen million.”

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.250
Do you understand?

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:20.380
I hope so.

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.580
Ahhh, let’s try a test right now.

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.840
Alright, so for the test, you should have
maybe a pen and a paper.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840
That will help you.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.080
There’s ten questions.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.080
Ok…

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.050
So, I’m going to say a number.

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:38.230
You have to think of that number and write
down that number.

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:41.250
So, number one.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.690
“Fifteen thousand.”

01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:48.130
“Fifteen thousand.”

01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:53.840
Ok, so you should have written fifteen thousand.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.350
Alright, number two.

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:58.140
“Eight hundred.”

01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.930
“Eight hundred.”

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:04.190
Ok, so you should write eight hundred.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:07.150
Number three.

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:08.650
“Seventy-five thousand.”

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:11.670
“Seventy-five thousand.”

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:13.180
Ok…

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:17.190
So it looks like this: seventy-five thousand.

01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:18.800
Number four.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.310
“Six million.”

01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:23.810
“Six million.”

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:26.750
Ok, so you should write it like this.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:29.750
With six zeros.

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.620
And number five.

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.550
“Six hundred thousand.”

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:37.670
“Six hundred thousand.”

01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:43.570
Ok, so six hundred thousand looks like this.

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:45.200
Number six.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.700
“Three thousand.”

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.200
“Three thousand.”

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:53.950
Ok, so this is three thousand.

01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:55.860
Number seven.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.680
“Nineteen thousand.”

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.500
“Nineteen thousand.”

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:05.710
Ok, so this is nineteen thousand.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.620
Number eight.

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.630
“Sixty-six thousand.”

01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:13.630
“Sixty-six thousand.”

01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:17.900
Ok, it looks like this.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.219
Number nine.

01:15:19.219 --> 01:15:22.170
“Five hundred thousand.”

01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:25.580
“Five hundred thousand.”

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:28.930
Ok, it looks like this.

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:30.760
And the last one.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.950
Number ten.

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:34.330
“Twenty-five million.”

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:36.710
“Twenty-five million.”

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:40.969
Alright, that’s a big number.

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:43.500
It looks like this.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.940
Wwoooo, I know that was a difficult test.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.840
I hope you did well.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:56.360
Uhh, I know big numbers are very difficult
to say and understand.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.670
It take a lot of practice.

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:00.730
Now I hope this video helps you.

01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:06.430
But again, you need a lot of self-study to
truly master these numbers.

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:07.710
Alright…

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:16.090
See you next video.

01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:21.380
This video is very very difficult.

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.110
This is ‘advanced numbers’.

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:24.110
Ok…

01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:26.400
It’s very difficult to understand.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.200
It’s very difficult to express these numbers.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.860
We’re going to talk about very big numbers
and how to say them.

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:35.860
Alright…

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.880
Uhhh, try not to be scared.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.820
I will try to teach you as simple as possible.

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:45.670
Again, this video is meant to help you.

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:50.520
You have to do a lot of self-study to truly
master these numbers.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.550
Ok, let’s start with the ‘hundreds’
here.

01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:56.440
Now we already know this number.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.920
You should be able to say this number by now.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.219
“One hundred.”

01:17:00.219 --> 01:17:02.410
But let’s look at the next…

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:03.410
Ok…

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:07.830
Now this is “one hundred and one.”

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:10.170
Now listen to what I said.

01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:12.220
“One hundred and one.”

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.370
Do you hear the ‘and’?

01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:15.370
Ok…

01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:18.010
Now, that’s actually British style.

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:21.530
When British people say numbers, they use
an ‘and’.

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:24.690
So, “One hundred and one.”

01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:27.610
But American style is different.

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:29.210
They don’t say “and”.

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:32.510
Ok, so, “One hundred and one.”

01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:35.830
American style is “One hundred one.”

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:37.380
No ‘and’.

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.380
Ok…

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.630
So British style again: “One hundred and
one.”

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:44.500
American style: “One hundred one.”

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.280
Now, which style should you use?

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.190
Doesn’t matter.

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:51.520
Both are ok.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:57.110
Everyone will understand you if you use British
style or American style.

01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:59.230
British style doesn’t sound strange.

01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:01.960
American style doesn’t sound strange.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:08.020
I come from Canada, so sometimes I use British
style, sometimes I use American style.

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.300
So, keep that in mind.

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:15.460
Probably when you’re listening to me, sometimes
I use the ‘and’, sometimes I don’t.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.460
Ok…

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.870
So, “One hundred and one” or “one hundred
one.”

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:23.400
Let’s look at the next number.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.400
Ok…

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:30.130
“One hundred fifty” or “one hundred
and fifty.”

01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:31.130
Ok…

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:34.469
So, we know this is fifty…”one hundred
fifty.”

01:18:34.469 --> 01:18:36.950
Let’s look at the next number.

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:39.820
That’s one.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:42.690
That’s fifty-one.

01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:48.950
“One hundred fifty-one” or “one hundred
and fifty-one.”

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:49.950
Alright…

01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:52.550
Let’s look at the next number.

01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:53.940
We know this is two.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:57.100
We know this is ninety-two.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:02.990
This is “seven hundred ninety-two” or
“seven hundred and ninety-two.”

01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:04.219
Alright…

01:19:04.219 --> 01:19:06.040
And the last number here.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.570
Well, we know that’s nine.

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.100
That’s ninety-nine.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:16.110
That’s “nine hundred ninety-nine” or
“nine hundred and ninety-nine.”

01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:17.110
Alright…

01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:18.210
So these are the ‘hundreds’.

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:20.520
Let’s move to bigger numbers.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.170
The ‘thousands’.

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:25.810
Are you read for some bigger number?

01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:29.780
I’m sorry, but it’s going to start to
get real difficult.

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:30.780
Ok…

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.510
So, let’s take a look here.

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:35.630
Listen carefully.

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:40.150
Our next number…we know this is ‘a’
thousand’.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:42.870
So this is “one thousand one.”

01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:46.730
Ok, “one thousand one.”

01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:50.130
If you want to use British style, “one thousand
and one.”

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:52.120
Ok, again, doesn’t matter.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.540
So, ”one thousand one.”

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.270
Let’s move up.

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:58.820
So we know this is ‘one hundred’.

01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:02.460
And we know this is “one thousand one hundred.”

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.580
“One thousand one hundred.”

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.580
Ok…

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.750
Now, let’s move to the the third number
here.

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:09.860
A little more confusing.

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.790
We got lost of numbers.

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:14.210
Ok, don’t be so scared.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:16.260
We know that’s ‘four’.

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.260
We know that’s ‘twenty-four’.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:22.590
We know that’s ‘three hundred and twenty-four’.

01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:24.469
And then we got the ‘thousands’.

01:20:24.469 --> 01:20:28.570
So, “seven thousand three hundred twenty-four.”

01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:31.150
“Seven thousand three hundred twenty-four.”

01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:34.840
Let’s move on to the next number.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:44.650
‘Five’, ‘fifty-five’, ‘five hundred
fifty-five’, “ten thousand five hundred

01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:45.650
fifty-five.”

01:20:45.650 --> 01:20:46.650
Ok…

01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:48.800
Let’s move on.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:57.600
‘Four’, ‘twenty-four’, ‘three hundred
and twenty-four’, “seventeen thousand

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.420
three hundred and twenty-four.”

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.870
Let’s move on.

01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:04.000
Bigger number here.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:10.739
‘Six’, ‘sixty-six’, ‘six hundred
and sixty-six’, “one hundred and fifty-two

01:21:10.739 --> 01:21:14.590
thousand six hundred and sixty-six.”

01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:17.310
Ok, let’s review these numbers again.

01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:19.800
“One thousand one.”

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.590
“One thousand one hundred.”

01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:27.100
“Seven thousand three hundred twenty-four.”

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:31.800
“Ten thousand five hundred fifty-five.”

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:37.920
“Seventeen thousand three hundred and twenty-four.”

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:43.650
“One hundred and fifty-two thousand six
hundred and sixty-six.”

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:44.650
Ok…

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:46.330
You ready for some more.

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:49.900
Let’s go to some even bigger numbers.

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:52.850
You’re still watching this video?

01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:58.930
Ahhh, that’s too bad because I have something
very scary to show you.

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:00.380
Chuuuuuu….

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:04.480
Alright, so here are some very very big numbers.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.760
And let’s try to say them.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.570
Uhhh, the first one.

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:11.050
Alright, we have three and three.

01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:14.820
So, we know this is ‘million’.

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:17.870
So this is going to be “six million eight.”

01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:20.250
Ok, very simple.

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:21.960
That’s an eight.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.670
“Six million eight.”

01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:25.780
Let’s move on to the next one.

01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:29.840
Alright, so if we take….we also know this
is ‘million’.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.260
But if we just start here.

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:32.360
How much is that?

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.340
Well, that’s ‘five hundred thousand’.

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.460
So how much is that?

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:40.820
Well that’s “five million five hundred
thousand”.

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:41.820
Alright…

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:46.590
Let’s get to a… very big and confusing
number.

01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:48.620
Even confusing to me.

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.150
But let’s try it together.

01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:53.670
Ahhh, again we have three and three.

01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:54.949
We know this is ‘million’.

01:22:54.949 --> 01:22:56.690
We know this is ‘thirteen million’.

01:22:56.690 --> 01:22:59.469
Ahhh, but, we have to say all of these numbers.

01:22:59.469 --> 01:23:02.580
Ok, so let’s start slow.

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:08.220
That’s ‘two’, ‘thirty-two’, ‘four
hundred thirty-two’.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:13.850
Well that’s a zero, but that’s…oh, we’re
going into a ..oh…it’s getting very confusing

01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:14.930
now.

01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:19.540
This would be ‘twenty thousand four hundred
thirty-two’.

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:27.540
‘Six hundred and twenty thousand four hundred
and thirty-two’.

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:35.090
“Thirteen million six hundred and twenty
thousand four hundred and thirty-two.”

01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:44.110
“Thirteen million six hundred and twenty
thousand four hundred and thirty-two.”

01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:46.500
Whew, big number.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.780
Let’s move on.

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.719
I’m scared myself.

01:23:49.719 --> 01:23:52.580
Alright, again, we have three and three.

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.940
I know this is ‘million’.

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:56.170
I know this is a ‘twenty-four million’.

01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:58.130
What are all these numbers?

01:23:58.130 --> 01:23:59.130
‘Two’.

01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:00.130
‘Thirty-two’.

01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:02.090
‘Four hundred and thirty-two’.

01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:04.960
‘Eight thousand four hundred and thirty-two’.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.340
‘Forty-eight thousand four hundred and thirty-two’.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:14.060
‘Five hundred and forty-eight thousand four
hundred and thirty-two’.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:21.460
And our final number, “twenty-four million
five hundred and forty-eight thousand four

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:24.090
hundred and thirty-two.”

01:24:24.090 --> 01:24:34.400
“Twenty-four million five hundred and forty-eight
thousand four hundred and thirty-two.”

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.050
The last one here.

01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:39.010
A really really big number.

01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.010
Ok…

01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:41.490
So, again, ‘seven’.

01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:42.490
‘Forty-seven’.

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:44.590
‘Nine hundred and forty-seven’.

01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:51.370
‘Two thousand nine hundred forty-seven’.

01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:56.270
‘Four hundred and thirty-two thousand nine
hundred and forty-seven’.

01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:57.270
And…

01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:58.270
what’s this?

01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:59.980
Again, this is three, three.

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.190
This is a ‘million’.

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:09.300
So this is, “One hundred and twenty-five
million four hundred and thirty-two thousand

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.520
nine hundred and forty-seven.”

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:21.340
“One hundred and twenty-five million four
hundred and thirty-two thousand nine hundred

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:23.490
and forty-seven.”

01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:28.090
Ok, do you understand all these numbers?

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:30.000
If you do, that’s great.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.820
Ahhh, but before we do a test, we’re going
to do a little extra practice.

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:39.070
Ok, so let’s just review a little bit.

01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:45.230
I have five numbers here, just for a quick
review….before the test.

01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:46.230
Ok…

01:25:46.230 --> 01:25:47.719
So, the first one.

01:25:47.719 --> 01:25:48.980
How much is this?

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:53.690
Well, ‘four’, ‘forty-four’, “four
hundred forty-four.”

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:55.590
And again, we can use the ‘and’.

01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:58.140
“Four hundred ‘and’ forty-four.”

01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:59.660
That’s possible.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.460
Uhhh, the next number.

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:05.110
Ok, we know three zeros…or three numbers
here.

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:06.110
This is ‘thousand’.

01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:11.270
So, “eight thousand nine hundred forty-two.”

01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:12.500
The next number.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.360
Ok.. lots of numbers…ahhh….

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.010
We know it’s ‘thousand’.

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:22.440
“Fifty-five thousand five hundred forty-three.”

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.280
Bigger number.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.290
Lots of sevens.

01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:28.730
But don’t be scared of all these sevens.

01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:30.930
So, again it’s just ‘thousand’.

01:26:30.930 --> 01:26:37.750
So, “two hundred and seventy-seven thousand
seven hundred seventy-seven.”

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:42.340
“Two hundred and seventy-seven thousand
seven hundred seventy-seven.”

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:45.310
Alright, and let’s go to the ‘millions’.

01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:46.310
Three, three.

01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:47.940
I know this is a ‘million’.

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:50.230
Cause it has two commas.

01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:56.860
So, “three million three hundred and twenty
thousand three hundred and twenty-one.

01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:57.860
Alright…

01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:03.230
So, if you can understand how to say these
five, you’re ready for the test.

01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:05.650
So, we’re going to start the test.

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:07.489
You should prepare some paper and a pen.

01:27:07.489 --> 01:27:12.020
Ahhh, I’m going to say the numbers and you
should write down the numbers.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.020
Alright…

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.300
So let’s start the test.

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:16.210
Good luck.

01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:17.490
Number one.

01:27:17.490 --> 01:27:21.130
“Six hundred sixty-six.”

01:27:21.130 --> 01:27:25.920
“Six hundred sixty-six.”

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.520
Alright, so you should write this.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.930
“Six hundred sixty-six.”

01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:35.040
Number two.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.640
“Three thousand two hundred twelve.”

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:46.160
“Three thousand two hundred twelve.”

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.550
Ok, so you should write this.

01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:51.420
The next number.

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.270
Number three.

01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:59.060
“Six thousand four hundred thirty-two.”

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:05.210
“Six thousand four hundred thirty-two.”

01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:10.330
Alright, so you should write this.

01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:12.000
Number four.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.350
Getting bigger.

01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:18.510
“Twelve thousand eight hundred fourteen.”

01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:25.150
“Twelve thousand eight hundred fourteen.”

01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:30.260
Alright, so it looks like this.

01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.570
Number five.

01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:38.060
“Twenty-two thousand four hundred thirty-two.”

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:43.310
“Twenty-two thousand four hundred thirty-two.”

01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:47.180
Ok, looks like this.

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:50.870
Number six.

01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:56.949
“Seventy-nine thousand five hundred twenty-one.”

01:28:56.949 --> 01:29:01.360
“Seventy-nine thousand five hundred twenty-one.”

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:04.850
Alright, looks like this.

01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:07.300
Number seven.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:13.750
“Four hundred and thirty-two thousand nine
hundred eighty-seven.”

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:22.969
“Four hundred thirty-two thousand nine hundred
eighty-seven.”

01:29:22.969 --> 01:29:28.530
Ok, looks like this.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:31.670
Number eight.

01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:39.800
“Two million three hundred and forty-three
thousand nine hundred eighty-two.”

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:51.469
“Two million three hundred and forty-three
thousand nine hundred eighty-two.”

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.440
Oh…very big number.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:56.880
Ok, it looks like this.

01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:01.120
Number nine.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:11.540
“Fifty-four million five hundred and forty-three
thousand nine hundred eighty-seven.”

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:19.370
“Fifty-four million five hundred and forty-three
thousand nine hundred eighty-seven.”

01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:22.969
Ok, so that looks like this.

01:30:22.969 --> 01:30:25.510
Number ten.

01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:26.520
The last one.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:29.910
Ok, the last one’s very difficult.

01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:31.270
Sorry.

01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:32.640
Ok…

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.620
Listen carefully.

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:43.699
“Eleven million one hundred eleven thousand
one hundred eleven.”

01:30:43.699 --> 01:30:52.710
“Eleven million one hundred eleven thousand
one hundred eleven.”

01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:58.910
Ok, so that looks like this.

01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:05.340
Uhhh, this is a very difficult video.

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.340
Uhhh.

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:09.440
Well, that’s English numbers.

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.130
Those are the advanced numbers.

01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:13.800
Uhhh, I hope you did well on the test.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:21.010
I know it was a very difficult test and it
takes a long long to master the numbers you

01:31:21.010 --> 01:31:22.219
saw today.

01:31:22.219 --> 01:31:23.230
Alright…

01:31:23.230 --> 01:31:24.830
Takes a lot of self-study.

01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:27.320
A lot of practice.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.100
But never give up…ahhh, you can do it.

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:31.640
I believe in you.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:34.530
Well, that’s it for this video.

01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:37.860
See you next time.

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:43.699
Hello, everyone.

01:31:43.699 --> 01:31:46.520
This is an advanced numbers video.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:50.670
I’m going to teach how to express some advanced
numbers.

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:53.110
Let’s take a look.

01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:57.710
Alright, we know this is expressed, “nine
hundred”.

01:31:57.710 --> 01:32:00.280
And let’s go to the next one.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:04.740
Now, I taught you before this is expressed
“one thousand”.

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:05.740
Ok…

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:10.150
Now, “one thousand” is the best way to
express it.

01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:16.640
But, it is possible to express it “ten hundred”.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.250
Ok…

01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:19.290
Next one.

01:32:19.290 --> 01:32:21.840
“One thousand one hundred.”

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.600
That’s the best way.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.850
But, some people will say “eleven hundred”.

01:32:27.850 --> 01:32:30.150
“Twelve hundred.”

01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:32.449
“Thirteen hundred.”

01:32:32.449 --> 01:32:34.750
“Fourteen hundred.”

01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:37.050
“Twenty hundred.”

01:32:37.050 --> 01:32:39.360
“Twenty-one hundred.”

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.660
“Ninety-nine hundred.”

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:48.010
Ok, this is only “ten thousand one hundred.”

01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:49.010
Ok…

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:52.550
This can be “ninety-nine hundred”, but
when you’re getting into bigger…bigger

01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:58.060
numbers, you have to stop saying “hundred”
and change to ‘thousands’.

01:32:58.060 --> 01:32:59.060
Ok…

01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:02.410
So you can say “hundred” between these
numbers.

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:07.310
Alright, so from “one hundred, two hundred,
three hundred, four hundred, five hundred,”

01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:16.570
all the way up to “ten hundred, twenty hundred,”
ahhh up…until “ninety-nine hundred ninety-nine”.

01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:21.010
So you can see this number is already past
that number.

01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:23.040
So the hundreds stop.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.239
Alright, this is a little bit confusing, I
know.

01:33:26.239 --> 01:33:28.910
Let’s do a little bit of practice.

01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:36.469
Ok, so I wrote a few more example to help
you understand how to express these numbers

01:33:36.469 --> 01:33:37.880
using ‘hundred’.

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.940
Alright…

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:40.580
So again, this is our range.

01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:44.650
We can only say “hundred” with these numbers.

01:33:44.650 --> 01:33:46.320
So the first one.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:54.900
The best way is “one thousand seven hundred”,
but you can express it “seventeen hundred”.

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:55.900
Next one.

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:58.390
“One thousand seven hundred one.”

01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:59.520
Or…

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.520
“Seventeen hundred one.”

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.280
“Seventy-five hundred.”

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.570
“Seventy-five hundred twenty-one.”

01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:12.880
“Ninety-two hundred twelve.”

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:13.880
and the last one.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.560
Ok, the last one is outside.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.560
Ok…

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.560
It’s continuing.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.710
It’s too big.

01:34:19.710 --> 01:34:26.140
We have to use ‘thousand’, so this has
to be “eleven thousand one hundred.”

01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:27.200
Ok…

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.930
You can’t say, “a hundred and eleven hundred.”

01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:33.510
Ok, it has to be “eleven thousand one hundred.”

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:39.280
Alright, I hope this helps you understand
a little better how to express in ‘hundreds’.

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:46.610
But, as your teacher, I prefer if you say
“one thousand seven hundred”.

01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:48.570
To use it that way.

01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:56.200
But I have to teach you the other way because
somebody might say to you “seventeen hundred”,

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.280
so you should be able to understand.

01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.280
Alright…

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.280
So that’s it.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:03.400
See you next video.

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:08.870
Hello, everyone.

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:13.530
In this video, we are going to talk about
ordinal numbers.

01:35:13.530 --> 01:35:18.590
Now, ordinal numbers are different than cardinal
numbers.

01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:24.920
Of course cardinal numbers are numbers like
one two three four five.

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.210
Ordinal numbers are different.

01:35:27.210 --> 01:35:32.239
Ordinal numbers are used for expressing things
like rank.

01:35:32.239 --> 01:35:36.690
First, second, third place… uhhh… in a
contest.

01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:40.010
Or they’re used to express anniversaries.

01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:44.580
For example, “This is my third wedding anniversary.”

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:49.950
And it’s also used commonly in the calendar
for dates.

01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:54.410
For example, “June first,” ahhh, “June
second.”

01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:55.410
Ok…

01:35:55.410 --> 01:35:57.640
So this where we use ordinal numbers.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:03.790
So, in this video, I’m going to teach you
how to write ordinal numbers and also pronounce

01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:04.790
them correctly.

01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:05.790
Ok…

01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:07.699
So, we’re going to look at the first ten.

01:36:07.699 --> 01:36:10.400
I have the first ten here.

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.340
So let’s go through them very quickly.

01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:20.250
This is “first”…and if you notice the
last two letters…I underline in blue.

01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:21.250
Ok…

01:36:21.250 --> 01:36:24.440
The last two letters are very important.

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:30.640
So, if you see first, the last two letters
are ‘s-t’.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:37.280
So when we want to write an ordinal number,
we have number one, we must use the last two

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.530
letters.

01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:40.900
The last two letters are ‘s-t’.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:43.480
So this is our ordinal number.

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:46.590
We should write ‘s-t’.

01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:48.090
Ok…

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:51.840
So this, ”first” and now we write it like
this.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.250
“First.”

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.880
And the ‘s-t’ is usually up.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.969
Ok…

01:36:56.969 --> 01:36:59.930
Let’s move on to “second”.

01:36:59.930 --> 01:37:02.440
‘Second’ we see that it is ‘n-d’.

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:07.650
So the last two letters of ‘second’, ‘n-d’.

01:37:07.650 --> 01:37:11.530
‘Two’, we have to put ‘n-d’.

01:37:11.530 --> 01:37:13.530
Alright…

01:37:13.530 --> 01:37:15.280
So now this is “second”.

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.280
“First.”

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.280
“Second.”

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.280
“Third.”

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.800
The last two letters, ‘r-d’.

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:27.570
So, we have to go over here…’r-d’.

01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:29.320
“Third.”

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.080
“Fourth.”

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:32.830
‘t-h’…..’t-h’.

01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:34.590
“Fifth.”

01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:40.140
‘Five’ and again, ‘t-h’.

01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:42.010
“Sixth.”

01:37:42.010 --> 01:37:43.870
‘t-h’.

01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:45.740
“Seventh.”

01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.610
‘t-h’.

01:37:47.610 --> 01:37:49.469
“Eighth.”

01:37:49.469 --> 01:37:51.340
‘t-h’.

01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.210
“Ninth.”

01:37:53.210 --> 01:37:55.070
‘t-h’.

01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:56.940
“Tenth.”

01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.810
‘t-h’.

01:37:58.810 --> 01:38:03.989
Ok, so you can see most of them use the ‘t-h’.

01:38:03.989 --> 01:38:09.710
Just the “first, second, third”, ‘s-t’,
‘n-d’, ‘r-d’.

01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:11.630
You have to be very careful.

01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:12.670
Alright…

01:38:12.670 --> 01:38:14.550
Look at these numbers over here.

01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:17.910
I wrote some numbers, circled in red.

01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:20.690
‘Three’ and ‘t-h’.

01:38:20.690 --> 01:38:22.660
‘Three’ and ‘t-h’.

01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:23.660
“Threeth.”

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:24.660
“Threeth.”

01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:26.920
Ok, this is a common mistake.

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:32.090
This is obviously wrong because ‘three’
only has ‘r-d’.

01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:35.330
You have to use these two letters.

01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:37.760
This is impossible.

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.100
Ok…

01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:43.120
So, “threeth”, impossible.

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.600
Next one.

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:45.750
“Sic…sic…sicond.”

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:53.000
Again, that is impossible cause “sixth”,
“sixth” must have ‘t-h’.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.969
So this is impossible.

01:38:55.969 --> 01:38:57.350
And the last one.

01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:58.350
“Ninst.”

01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:59.350
“Ninst.”

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:00.670
Well, “ninth.”

01:39:00.670 --> 01:39:03.650
“Ninth” must have ‘t-h’.

01:39:03.650 --> 01:39:06.330
So, these are impossible.

01:39:06.330 --> 01:39:10.730
So you have to be very careful writing these
numbers.

01:39:10.730 --> 01:39:13.640
They must use the last two letters.

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:14.640
Ok…

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.310
Let’s worry about pronunciation right now.

01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:20.480
Pronunciation can be a little bit difficult,
also.

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.590
So let’s go through the list.

01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:25.469
And you should watch me and listen carefully.

01:39:25.469 --> 01:39:27.969
So, “first.”

01:39:27.969 --> 01:39:29.219
“Second.”

01:39:29.219 --> 01:39:30.469
“Third.”

01:39:30.469 --> 01:39:31.719
“Fourth.”

01:39:31.719 --> 01:39:40.120
Ok, when I say “Fourth”, look at my tongue.

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.090
My tongue comes out.

01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:45.880
“Fourth.”

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.670
“Fifth.”

01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:49.460
“Sixth.”

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.250
“Seventh.”

01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:53.040
“Eighth.”

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.830
“Ninth.”

01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:56.620
“Tenth.”

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.410
Ok…

01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:03.870
So, the ‘t-h’, your tongue should be coming
out.

01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:08.110
Let’s do the ‘t-h’ again.

01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:09.110
“Fourth.”

01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:10.110
“Fifth.”

01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:11.110
“Sixth.”

01:40:11.110 --> 01:40:12.110
“Seventh.”

01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:13.110
“Eighth.”

01:40:13.110 --> 01:40:14.110
“Ninth.”

01:40:14.110 --> 01:40:15.110
“Tenth.”

01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:16.110
Ok…

01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:17.110
So these are the first ten.

01:40:17.110 --> 01:40:18.110
You should know these.

01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:20.090
Let’s move on to some bigger numbers.

01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:23.660
Alright, let’s continue with our ordinal
numbers.

01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:26.510
The next, after ‘tenth’, is “eleventh”.

01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:31.300
We see the ‘t-h’ and the ‘t-h’ goes
there.

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.469
“Eleventh”.

01:40:32.469 --> 01:40:34.489
And the next one.”

01:40:34.489 --> 01:40:35.730
“Twelfth.”

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:37.760
‘t-h’
And the next one.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:45.699
I did not write the next ones here, but I
will say them, so listen carefully.

01:40:45.699 --> 01:40:48.239
So, “eleventh”.

01:40:48.239 --> 01:40:49.510
“Twelfth.”

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:50.780
“Thirteenth.”

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.040
“Fourteenth.”

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:53.310
“Fifteenth.”

01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:54.580
“Sixteenth.”

01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.850
“Seventeenth.”

01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:57.120
“Eighteenth.”

01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.390
“Nineteenth.”

01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:59.660
“Twentieth.”

01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:03.340
Alright, let’s look at ‘twentieth’.

01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:04.340
Ok…

01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:05.630
So, it’s ‘twenty’.

01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:13.179
‘Twenty’ has a ‘y’, but you can they
take out the ‘y’, they put in an ‘i-e-t-h’.

01:41:13.179 --> 01:41:15.030
This is “twentieth”.

01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:16.960
And we would write it with a ‘t-h’.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.300
‘Twenty’ with a ‘t-h’.

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.300
“Twentieth.”

01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:25.480
Alright, so with the pronunciation, “Twenty,
Twentieth.”

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.850
“Twentieth.”

01:41:26.850 --> 01:41:28.230
“Twentieth.”

01:41:28.230 --> 01:41:30.489
After ‘twentieth’, “Twenty-first.”

01:41:30.489 --> 01:41:32.100
Ok, “Twenty-first.”

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:36.080
And we would write ‘twenty-one’ with the
‘s-t’.

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.640
This is “Twenty-first.”

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.370
And again, I did not write the next ones here,
but listen carefully.

01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:46.469
So, “Twentieth.”

01:41:46.469 --> 01:41:48.020
“Twenty-first.”

01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:49.570
“Twenty-second.”

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:51.120
“Twenty-third.”

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:52.660
“Twenty-fourth.”

01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:54.210
“Twenty-fifth.”

01:41:54.210 --> 01:41:55.760
“Twenty-sixth.”

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.310
“Twenty-seventh.”

01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:58.860
“Twenty-eighth.”

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.410
“Twenty-ninth.”

01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:01.960
“Thirtieth.”

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:08.320
And again, like ‘twentieth’, ‘thirtieth’,
no ‘y’ just ‘i-e-t-h’.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.739
“Thirtieth.”

01:42:09.739 --> 01:42:11.160
“Thirtieth.”

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.580
“Thirtieth.”

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:14.010
Alright…

01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:18.640
And I also want to talk about the pronunciation
of “twelfth”.

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.670
‘Twelfth’ is very difficult to pronounce.

01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:25.489
If you look at it here, you see that ‘f’.

01:42:25.489 --> 01:42:29.040
And many students try to pronounce it with
the ‘f’.

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:30.050
“Twelfth.”

01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:34.010
Ok, that’s very difficult.

01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:40.600
But what is actually more common, even with
native speakers, is we don’t pronounce the

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.600
‘f’.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.600
We just skip it.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.140
So, for example, if we cut that ‘f’.

01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:48.780
Imagine it is not there.

01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:49.780
“Twelth.”

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:52.270
Ok, that’s a little bit easier.

01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:54.120
You can just say “Twelth”.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.470
“Twelth.”

01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:56.820
Ok…

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:59.200
So again, “Twelfth”.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.200
“Twentieth.”

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.120
Ok, be sure to pronounce those correctly.

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.760
Let’s move on to some bigger number.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:13.820
Ok, so I am sorry because I cannot write every
ordinal number.

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:14.820
Ok…

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:16.470
I cannot explain every number.

01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:21.989
So, you’re going to have to practice guessing
what is the ordinal number.

01:43:21.989 --> 01:43:27.450
And I put some numbers here and we’re going
to guess whether they use ‘s-t’, ‘n-d’,

01:43:27.450 --> 01:43:29.110
‘r-d’ or ‘t-h’.

01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:30.110
Ok…

01:43:30.110 --> 01:43:32.880
We only have four choices.

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.170
The first number is “fifty-six”.

01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:40.360
So if we want to change that to an ordinal
number, we have to choose one of these.

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:41.360
Ok…

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.489
So, “fifty-six”.

01:43:42.489 --> 01:43:48.290
Well, we know ‘six’ is…’six’ is
‘t-h’.

01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:49.620
“Sixth.”

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:50.920
And it’s going to be the same.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:51.920
“Fifty-sixth.”

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.300
So, I’m going to write a ‘t-h’ there.

01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:58.510
Let’s move on to the next number.

01:43:58.510 --> 01:43:59.510
“Ninety-one.”

01:43:59.510 --> 01:44:02.520
Well, what’s the ordinal number?

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.780
“Ninety-oneth?”

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.039
No.

01:44:05.039 --> 01:44:09.719
This is going to be like ‘twenty-first’
and ‘thirty-first’.

01:44:09.719 --> 01:44:13.600
This is going to be “ninety-first”.

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.570
Alright, the next one is “one hundred”.

01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:20.040
So, we have to choose one of these.

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:21.260
“One hundredst?”

01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:22.480
“One hundrednd?”

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.710
“One hundredrd?”

01:44:23.710 --> 01:44:24.929
“One hundredth?”

01:44:24.929 --> 01:44:28.010
Ok, it’s going to be the ‘t-h’.

01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:29.730
“One hundredth.”

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.449
“One hundredth.”

01:44:31.449 --> 01:44:32.449
Alright…

01:44:32.449 --> 01:44:33.610
And the next number.

01:44:33.610 --> 01:44:35.350
“One oh one.

01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:36.620
One hundred one.”

01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:39.219
Well, this is like “ninety-first.”

01:44:39.219 --> 01:44:40.710
This is “first” again.

01:44:40.710 --> 01:44:41.710
“First.”

01:44:41.710 --> 01:44:46.820
So, it’s going to be “One hundred and
first.

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:48.650
One hundred first.”

01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:49.830
Alright…

01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:51.090
And the last one.

01:44:51.090 --> 01:44:52.550
“One thousand.”

01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:54.280
We have to choose one.

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.040
Well, “One hundredth.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.040
One thousandth.”

01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.860
Ok, it’s going to be the same.

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.239
Alright…

01:45:01.239 --> 01:45:03.510
So again, I’m sorry I can’t teach every
number.

01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:05.690
Your going to have to learn how to guess correctly.

01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:09.940
Ahhh, we’re going to do a quick test…right
now.

01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:16.800
So what I want you to do in the test is write
down or think about what the correct ordinal

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.750
number is.

01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:21.870
Again, just write in the ordinal number.

01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:23.170
Number one.

01:45:23.170 --> 01:45:26.800
“It is September twentieth.”

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:32.370
“It is September twentieth.”

01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:37.880
Alright, so you should’ve written ‘twentieth’.

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.360
Number two.

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:45.530
“Seoul National university is ranked first.”

01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:52.390
“Seoul National university is ranked first.”

01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:56.880
Alright, so you should’ve written ‘first’.

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.600
Number three.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.739
“We live in the twenty-first century.”

01:46:03.739 --> 01:46:09.489
“We live in the twenty-first century.”

01:46:09.489 --> 01:46:16.010
Ok, so you should write ‘twenty-first’.

01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:17.640
Number four.

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:21.460
“I was born on March seventeenth.”

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:27.199
“I was born on March seventeenth.”

01:46:27.199 --> 01:46:33.670
Ok, you should write ‘seventeenth’.

01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:35.350
And number five.

01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:40.219
“We are celebrating our twelfth wedding
anniversary.”

01:46:40.219 --> 01:46:46.870
“We are celebrating our twelfth wedding
anniversary.”

01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:53.710
Ok, so you should’ve written ‘twelfth’.

01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:57.810
Ok, I hope you did well on that little test.

01:46:57.810 --> 01:46:58.810
Ok…

01:46:58.810 --> 01:47:01.500
Now, ordinal numbers are important.

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:08.350
Again, they’re used for ranking and they’re
used for the calendar, and also anniversaries.

01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:13.550
Also, sometimes, you see book volumes use
ordinal numbers.

01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:16.600
Ok, so you should know ordinal numbers.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:23.410
Now, it takes a lot of practice and self-study
to truly truly master ordinal numbers.

01:47:23.410 --> 01:47:26.960
I hope this video helped you understand them
a little bit better.

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.500
And, well, that’s it.

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:32.900
See you next time.

01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:38.570
Hello, everyone.

01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:42.660
In this video, we’re going to talk about
fractions.

01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:43.970
Ok…

01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:48.860
Now fractions are a little bit difficult to
express in English.

01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:53.600
So I hope this video will help you understand
how to express them in English.

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:54.600
Ok…

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.120
So, I wrote a few fractions here.

01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:01.340
Of course, this is not all the possible fractions.

01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:06.370
This is just a few to help you understand
how to express fractions.

01:48:06.370 --> 01:48:07.370
Ok…

01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:09.930
So these are fractions.

01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:10.930
And it doesn’t matter.

01:48:10.930 --> 01:48:13.880
The line is this way or this way.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.699
Alright, so I’m going to go through the
first one here.

01:48:17.699 --> 01:48:20.270
And this is probably the most common fraction.

01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:27.660
Ok, so we express this as “one half” or
“a half”.

01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:28.670
Ok…

01:48:28.670 --> 01:48:32.350
So as I said, it’s very common “half”.

01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:36.630
The next one…is, uhhh, “one third”.

01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:38.440
“One third.”

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:44.530
Alright, do you remember the ordinal numbers
we studied in the previous video?

01:48:44.530 --> 01:48:48.210
The ordinal numbers are “first, second,
third”.

01:48:48.210 --> 01:48:50.600
Well you have to use those here.

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.230
So this is “one-three.”?

01:48:52.230 --> 01:48:53.230
No.

01:48:53.230 --> 01:48:55.440
This is “One-third.”

01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:57.840
So, “A half.”

01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.840
“One-third.”

01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:01.480
And the next one is also very common.

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.989
It’s a very common fraction.

01:49:03.989 --> 01:49:05.160
“One-fourth.”

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.330
No.

01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:08.100
It has a special name.

01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:14.680
If you see this, this is “one-quarter”
or “a quarter”.

01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:15.680
Ok…

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:20.880
So, “A half, one-third, a quarter.”

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.840
The next line.

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.659
Now, we have “one-third” and you see “two-third”?

01:49:27.659 --> 01:49:31.260
Well, ‘one’ is single.

01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.640
It’s only one.

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:35.390
But two is plural.

01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:38.060
So, we don’t say “two-third”.

01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:40.420
We have to say “two-thirds”.

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:45.210
Ok, we have to add an ‘s’ at the end.

01:49:45.210 --> 01:49:47.199
So, “one-third….two-thirds.”

01:49:47.199 --> 01:49:53.550
Alright, and let’s go on to the next one.

01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:57.159
So, “two-fifths.”

01:49:57.159 --> 01:49:58.969
“Two-fifths.”

01:49:58.969 --> 01:50:00.780
Alright…

01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:04.790
The next line, I’m starting with three and,
oh, we have the four.

01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:08.179
So this is, uhhh, ‘one-quarter’.

01:50:08.179 --> 01:50:10.429
This is “three-quarters”.

01:50:10.429 --> 01:50:12.370
Ok…

01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:13.370
This has an ‘s’.

01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:18.320
This has no ‘s’ cause it’s singular.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.330
“One-quarter.”

01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:21.360
“Three- quarters.”

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.380
Ok…

01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:24.409
What’s this?

01:50:24.409 --> 01:50:25.429
“Three-sevenths.”

01:50:25.429 --> 01:50:26.440
Ok…

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.900
They’re very difficult to pronounce.

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:29.990
I know.

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:32.199
Takes a lot of practice.

01:50:32.199 --> 01:50:33.830
“Three-sevenths.”

01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:35.460
Alright…

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:37.400
The last line.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:39.760
What’s this?

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.940
“Five-sixths.”

01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:45.530
Ok, this is very difficult to pronounce.

01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:47.739
“Five-sixths.”

01:50:47.739 --> 01:50:48.980
And the last one.

01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:54.070
Ok, sometimes fractions are expressed with
a ‘whole’ number.

01:50:54.070 --> 01:51:04.239
So we would say, “two and nine-tenths”.

01:51:04.239 --> 01:51:05.239
Ok…

01:51:05.239 --> 01:51:06.420
“Two and nine-tenths.”

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:08.949
So you would have to put an ‘and’ in there.

01:51:08.949 --> 01:51:09.949
Alright…

01:51:09.949 --> 01:51:13.920
So, uhhh, I hope this helps you understand
how to express fractions.

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:19.230
Uhhh, let’s do a little bit more practice
with our listening.

01:51:19.230 --> 01:51:23.170
Alright, so here’s a couple of example sentences.

01:51:23.170 --> 01:51:26.880
Ahhh, the first one.

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:32.130
“Four-fifths or Canadians speak English.”

01:51:32.130 --> 01:51:35.380
“Four-fifths or Canadians speak English.”

01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:39.989
Alright, let’s look at number two.

01:51:39.989 --> 01:51:44.719
“One-third of Korean men smoke.”

01:51:44.719 --> 01:51:46.870
“One-third of Korean men smoke.”

01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:49.840
Alright, number three.

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.969
“I went to a quarter of my English classes.”

01:51:53.969 --> 01:52:01.260
“I went to a quarter of my English classes.”

01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:02.880
And the last example.

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:06.730
“My shoe size is ten and a half.”

01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:10.530
“My shoe size is ten and a half.”

01:52:10.530 --> 01:52:15.800
Alright, so that’s fractions.

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:21.320
I know, uhhh, it’s a little confusing and
difficult, but I’m sure, with some self-study,

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.050
and practice, you’ll know it very well.

01:52:25.050 --> 01:52:26.050
Ok…

01:52:26.050 --> 01:52:29.260
See you next video.

01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:35.070
Hello, everyone.

01:52:35.070 --> 01:52:38.489
In this video, we are going to talk about
speed.

01:52:38.489 --> 01:52:39.489
Ok…

01:52:39.489 --> 01:52:43.550
Now, there’ two ways to express speed.

01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:45.890
There’s..uhhh..the Metric System.

01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:51.570
Now, the Metric System, that’s what we use
in Korea and that’s what I use in Canada.

01:52:51.570 --> 01:52:55.890
But, there’s also the Imperial System.

01:52:55.890 --> 01:53:02.270
The Imperial System you might see in the U.S.A.
or even England.

01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:03.270
Ok…

01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:06.350
But first, let’s look at the Metric System.

01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:09.940
Alright, so I’m just going to focus on ‘k-m-h’.

01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:17.310
And ‘k-m-h’, of course, is “kilometers
per hour”.

01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:21.909
“kilometers per hour.”

01:53:21.909 --> 01:53:23.640
Notice I emphasize the ‘s’.

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:27.510
Ok, you always have to express the ‘s’.

01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:29.070
“Kilometers.”

01:53:29.070 --> 01:53:30.640
“Kilometers.”

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:33.110
“kilometers per hour.”

01:53:33.110 --> 01:53:38.570
Alright, so I just have two examples here
cause it’s quite easy.

01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:40.120
What is this speed?

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.320
Well, “Six kilometers per hour.”

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:49.760
Ok, there’s no ‘s’ here, but you…again,
you always have to say the ‘s’.

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:53.320
“Six kilometers per hour.”

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.210
And the next speed.

01:53:55.210 --> 01:53:58.920
“One hundred twenty-five kilometers per
hour.”

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:01.429
Ok, let’s say it a little faster.

01:54:01.429 --> 01:54:04.070
“Six kilometers per hour.”

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:07.110
“One hundred twenty-five kilometers per
hour.”

01:54:07.110 --> 01:54:09.070
Ok, you hear the ‘s’?

01:54:09.070 --> 01:54:10.650
“Six kilometers per hour.”

01:54:10.650 --> 01:54:13.560
Ok, it’s very difficult, but it’s there.

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.880
“Six kilometers per hour.”

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:17.090
“Six kilometers per hour.”

01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:20.800
“One hundred twenty-five kilometers per
hour.”

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:28.719
Alright, so I’ve been using the pronunciation
of “kilometers”, but some people might

01:54:28.719 --> 01:54:30.380
say “kilometers”.

01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:35.390
Ok, so both pronunciations are acceptable.

01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:38.300
“Kilometers” and “kilometers”.

01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:40.050
But more common is “kilometers”.

01:54:40.050 --> 01:54:41.050
Ok…

01:54:41.050 --> 01:54:43.750
So, let’s look at a few example sentences.

01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:47.300
Alright, I have three examples here.

01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:48.710
The first one.

01:54:48.710 --> 01:54:53.060
“The speed limit is one hundred kilometers
per hour.”

01:54:53.060 --> 01:55:00.989
“The speed limit is one hundred kilometers
per hour.”

01:55:00.989 --> 01:55:02.840
The second example.

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:07.340
“The KTX travels three hundred kilometers
per hour.”

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:14.600
“The KTX travels three hundred kilometers
per hour.”

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.230
And the last example.

01:55:16.230 --> 01:55:21.090
“The average walking speed is five kilometers
per hour.”

01:55:21.090 --> 01:55:27.850
“The average walking speed is five kilometers
per hour.”

01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:31.850
Ok, let’s talk about the Imperial System.

01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:38.360
Again, the Imperial System is commonly used
in America, or you might see it in England,

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.360
too.

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:41.929
They’re going to use ‘m-p-h’.

01:55:41.929 --> 01:55:47.219
Now ‘m-p-h’, of course, “miles per hour”.

01:55:47.219 --> 01:55:50.970
Again, we have to say “miles per hour”.

01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:54.739
“Miles per hour.”

01:55:54.739 --> 01:56:05.420
And “one mile per hour” is equal to, about
“one point six kilometers per hour”.

01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.540
Ok…

01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:08.830
So again, this is the Imperial System.

01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:10.580
This is the Metric System.

01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:11.990
Little bit different.

01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.990
Ok…

01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:17.040
So let’s practice expressing these two.

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.500
The first one.

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.699
“Ten miles per hour.”

01:56:20.699 --> 01:56:22.790
I’ll say it a little faster.

01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:24.210
“Ten miles per hour.”

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:26.880
“Ten miles per hour.”

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:29.210
Ok, again, there’s the ‘s’.

01:56:29.210 --> 01:56:31.179
“Ten miles per hour.”

01:56:31.179 --> 01:56:32.780
And the next one.

01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:35.340
“Two hundred and one miles per hour.”

01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:39.469
“Two hundred and one miles per hour.”

01:56:39.469 --> 01:56:41.080
Be sure to have that ‘s’.

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:45.090
Ok, that’s one of the most common mistakes…uhm…my
students make.

01:56:45.090 --> 01:56:46.300
They say, “mile per hour.”

01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:48.100
“Ten mile per hour.”

01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:49.930
Ok, you have to have that ‘s’.

01:56:49.930 --> 01:56:52.020
“Ten mile per hour.”

01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:54.360
“Two hundred and one miles per hour.”

01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:55.360
Alright…

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:59.969
Let’s look at a few examples using ‘miles
per hour’.

01:56:59.969 --> 01:57:01.300
The first one.

01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:04.870
“The car was going one hundred miles per
hour.”

01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:09.650
“The car was going one hundred miles per
hour.”

01:57:09.650 --> 01:57:13.489
Ok, the second example.

01:57:13.489 --> 01:57:17.570
“The airplane travels six hundred miles
per hour.”

01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:24.790
“The airplane travels six hundred miles
per hour.”

01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:26.790
And the last example.

01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:32.030
“The speed of sound is seven hundred and
sixty-one miles per hour.”

01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:38.650
“The speed of sound is seven hundred and
sixty-one miles per hour.”

01:57:38.650 --> 01:57:44.870
Alright, so we learned the Metric System using
‘kilometers per hour’.

01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:49.000
And we learned the Imperial System using ‘miles
per hour’.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.730
So again…uhhh.. depends where you are in
the world.

01:57:52.730 --> 01:57:59.550
Ahh, some countries…actually most countries
use the Metric System these days, but probably,

01:57:59.550 --> 01:58:03.510
certainly if you’re in the U.S.A., they’re
still using the Imperial System.

01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:04.510
Alright…

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:05.610
So, that’s it.

01:58:05.610 --> 01:58:08.800
I hope you’ve learned how to express speed.

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:12.060
And..uhh, see you next time.

01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:16.100
Hello, everyone.

01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:24.510
In this video we are going to talk about ‘height’,
Ok…and how to express it in English.

01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:29.409
Now, there are two systems…uhhh…to express
‘height’.

01:58:29.409 --> 01:58:32.199
The first system is the Metric System.

01:58:32.199 --> 01:58:35.210
The Metric System… used in Korea.

01:58:35.210 --> 01:58:38.610
Also, Canada, where I’m from.

01:58:38.610 --> 01:58:41.690
And the other system is the Imperial System.

01:58:41.690 --> 01:58:49.190
The Imperial System used in…especially in
America, but sometimes we also use it in Canada.

01:58:49.190 --> 01:58:55.640
So, it’s good…you should know the Metric
System, of course, but you should know a little

01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:59.310
bit of the Imperial System, in case you need
to use it.

01:58:59.310 --> 01:59:00.310
Alright…

01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:03.550
Now, first, we’re going to talk about the
Metric System.

01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:06.370
So, take a look.

01:59:06.370 --> 01:59:08.060
And I have two questions here.

01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:10.050
So, let’s just look at the first one.

01:59:10.050 --> 01:59:13.710
The first one is asking “How tall are you?”.

01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:15.560
“How tall are you?”

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:16.560
Ok…

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.100
So, I put my height.

01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:23.890
So, “I’m one hundred and eighty-three
centimeters tall.”

01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:26.360
So, listen again.

01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:29.909
“I’m one hundred eighty-three centimeters
tall.”

01:59:29.909 --> 01:59:34.739
“I’m one hundred eighty-three centimeters…
tall.”

01:59:34.739 --> 01:59:39.850
“Centimeters…tall”
Ok, there’s no ‘s’ here, but when you’re

01:59:39.850 --> 01:59:43.350
reading this, you’re reading…or you’re
saying your height.

01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:46.580
You have to use the plural, “centimeters”.

01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:47.790
“Centimeters.”

01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:49.000
Ok…

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.010
“I’m one hundred eighty-three centimeters…
tall.”

01:59:53.010 --> 01:59:59.370
Don’t say, don’t say, ”I’m one hundred
eighty-three centimeter… tall.”

01:59:59.370 --> 02:00:05.890
“One hundred eighty-three centimeters…tall”
Ok…got it?

02:00:05.890 --> 02:00:06.890
You understand?

02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:09.520
Alright, let’s look at the next question.

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:13.929
Ok, both questions are asking the same thing,
about height.

02:00:13.929 --> 02:00:15.870
“What’s your height?”

02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:17.320
“What’s your height?”

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:24.830
Well, “My height is…”, again, “…one
hundred eighty-three centimeters…centimeters”,

02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:28.050
remember the ‘s’.

02:00:28.050 --> 02:00:30.270
“One hundred eighty-three centimeters.”

02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:36.390
So, that’s one way to express it, but I
also have an example using ‘meters’.

02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:42.860
So, “My height is one point eight three
meters.”

02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:49.000
So, if your using ‘centimeters’ or ‘meters’,
both of them need the ‘s’.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Ok…

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.159
So, one more time.

02:00:51.159 --> 02:00:52.630
I’ll say it really fast.

02:00:52.630 --> 02:00:54.290
“How tall are you?”

02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:56.120
“How tall are you?”

02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:58.460
“I’m one hundred and eighty-three centimeters
tall.”

02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:02.030
“I’m one hundred and eighty-three centimeters
tall.”

02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:05.170
“What’s your height?”

02:01:05.170 --> 02:01:07.000
“What’s your height?”

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.460
“My height is one hundred and eighty-three
centimeters.”

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:15.290
“My height is one point eighty-three meters.”

02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:20.199
Ok, so let’s look at a few more examples.

02:01:20.199 --> 02:01:24.370
Alright, let’s start with the first example.

02:01:24.370 --> 02:01:29.600
“He is one hundred and seventy-five centimeters
tall.”

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:35.429
“He is one hundred and seventy-five centimeters
tall.”

02:01:35.429 --> 02:01:43.590
“The sixty-three floor building is two hundred
and forty-nine meters high.”

02:01:43.590 --> 02:01:50.560
Ok, we use ‘tall’ for people, but for
building we would probably use ‘high’

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.560
So…

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:58.640
“The sixty-three floor building is two hundred
and forty-nine meters high.”

02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:00.100
The last example.

02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:07.480
“The height of Mount Everest is eight thousand
eight hundred and forty-eight meters.”

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:15.840
“The height of Mount Everest is eight thousand
eight hundred and forty-eight meters.”

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:20.679
Alright, let’s look at the Imperial System
now.

02:02:20.679 --> 02:02:24.000
The Imperial System is a little more confusing.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.120
Ahhh, so you should…ahhh.. listen carefully.

02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.420
I have the same question.

02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:32.219
“How tall are you?”

02:02:32.219 --> 02:02:35.400
But the answer is expressed very differently.

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.110
So, “How tall are you?”

02:02:38.110 --> 02:02:41.440
“I’m…” this is “…six feet tall”.

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.890
“I’m six feet tall.”

02:02:43.890 --> 02:02:50.489
Alright, so in the Metric System, “I’m
one hundred eighty-three centimeters tall.”

02:02:50.489 --> 02:02:55.280
Well in the Imperial System, I would express
that, “I’m six feet tall.”

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.460
So let’s take a look at the Imperial System.

02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:02.070
They use ‘inches’ and ‘feet’.

02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:03.070
Ok…

02:03:03.070 --> 02:03:11.440
So one inch…is equal to two point five four
centimeters.

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:17.640
And one foot…is equal to thirty point four
eight centimeters.

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:20.989
Alright, so, look at this.

02:03:20.989 --> 02:03:22.120
“One foot.”

02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:25.010
They say “one foot”.

02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:26.760
“Two foot?”

02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:27.760
No.

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:29.400
“One foot.”

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.159
“Two feet.”

02:03:31.159 --> 02:03:32.920
“Three feet.”

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:36.300
“I am six feet.”

02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:37.670
Ok…

02:03:37.670 --> 02:03:43.420
So the singular is ‘foot’, for one, but
the plural is ‘feet’.

02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:44.420
Alright…

02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:49.200
So, they’re going to show their height like
this.

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:51.150
And how do we read this?

02:03:51.150 --> 02:03:53.570
Well, this is “five feet”.

02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:55.060
The first number is ‘feet’.

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.060
“Five feet”.

02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:58.720
They’re going to put this.

02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.940
“Seven inches.”

02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:07.130
Ok, so this person is “five feet seven inches”.

02:04:07.130 --> 02:04:11.320
Now if you look at mine, I’m “six feet
zero inches”.

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:12.570
“Zero inches.”

02:04:12.570 --> 02:04:18.170
Ok, but this is the inch place, so “five
feet seven inches”.

02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:19.950
And they write it like this.

02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:20.950
Ok…

02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:25.719
Let’s look at a few more examples of the
imperial system.

02:04:25.719 --> 02:04:28.930
Alright, so here’s the first example.

02:04:28.930 --> 02:04:36.920
“The Empire State Building rises to one
thousand two hundred and fifty feet.”

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:44.190
“The Empire State Building rises to one
thousand two hundred and fifty feet.”

02:04:44.190 --> 02:04:47.170
The next example.

02:04:47.170 --> 02:04:50.850
“My mom is five foot two inches tall.”

02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:58.440
“My mom is five foot two inches tall.”

02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:00.239
The last example.

02:05:00.239 --> 02:05:05.690
“The basketball player is seven feet two
inches tall.”

02:05:05.690 --> 02:05:12.929
“The basketball player is seven feet two
inches tall.”

02:05:12.929 --> 02:05:20.751
Alright, so, now we know how to express…uhh..
height in the Metric System and the Imperial

02:05:20.751 --> 02:05:21.751
System.

02:05:21.751 --> 02:05:22.751
Ok…

02:05:22.751 --> 02:05:26.740
Again, probably in Korea, we’re just going
to use the Metric System.

02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:33.040
But if you’re talking to an American, they
might only understand the Imperial System.

02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:38.199
Ok, so you should know how to express your
height both ways.

02:05:38.199 --> 02:05:43.560
So, again, “I’m one hundred eighty-three
centimeters tall.”

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:44.560
Or…

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.400
“My height is one hundred eighty-three centimeters.”

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:52.440
But I could also express that, “I’m…ahh…
six feet tall.”

02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.440
Alright…

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:55.040
That’s height.

02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:58.590
And see you next time.

02:05:58.590 --> 02:06:04.050
Hello, everyone.

02:06:04.050 --> 02:06:09.920
In this video, we’re going to talk about
a very sensitive topic; weight…or how much

02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:10.940
you weigh.

02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:11.940
Alright…

02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:13.790
Again, there’s two systems.

02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:17.760
There’s the Metric System using kilograms.

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:24.150
And there’s the Imperial System that they
will use in the U.S.A. using pounds.

02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:28.050
But first, let’s look at the Metric System…using
kilograms.

02:06:28.050 --> 02:06:29.050
Ok…

02:06:29.050 --> 02:06:32.210
So, there’s two questions again.

02:06:32.210 --> 02:06:36.250
The most common questions to ask someone about
their weight.

02:06:36.250 --> 02:06:38.440
So let’s look at the first question.

02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:41.550
The first question, “How much do you weigh?”

02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:43.710
“How much do you weigh?”

02:06:43.710 --> 02:06:47.949
Now, notice I don’t put “weight”.

02:06:47.949 --> 02:06:48.949
Ok…

02:06:48.949 --> 02:06:53.949
‘Weigh’ is a verb and ‘weight’ is
a noun.

02:06:53.949 --> 02:06:56.010
This questions, we have to use ‘weigh’.

02:06:56.010 --> 02:06:58.739
“How much do you weigh?”

02:06:58.739 --> 02:06:59.760
And your answer.

02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:04.159
“I weigh seventy-five kilograms.”

02:07:04.159 --> 02:07:05.440
Ok, that’s my weight.

02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:09.080
“I weigh seventy-five kilograms.”

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:10.080
Now listen.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.840
I say “Seventy-five kilograms.”

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:13.840
“Kilograms.”

02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:16.790
Don’t forget the ‘s’ at the end.

02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:17.790
“Kilograms.”

02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:19.909
“I weigh seventy-five kilograms.”

02:07:19.909 --> 02:07:23.760
Let’s look at this answer.

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:27.630
“I weight seventy-five kilograms.”

02:07:27.630 --> 02:07:30.730
Ok, you see this ‘x’?

02:07:30.730 --> 02:07:32.040
That means it’s wrong.

02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:34.210
Ok, never say, “I weight…”

02:07:34.210 --> 02:07:35.210
This is wrong.

02:07:35.210 --> 02:07:36.400
It’s “I weigh…”

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.400
“I weigh…”

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:39.880
“I weight seventy-five kilograms.”

02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:42.170
Ok, so this is wrong.

02:07:42.170 --> 02:07:44.100
Do not say this.

02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:46.860
Let’s move on to the next question.

02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:48.800
“What’s your weight?”

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:52.030
Ok, now it’s using the noun form.

02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:54.130
“What’s your weight?”

02:07:54.130 --> 02:07:59.870
“My weight is seventy-five kilograms.”

02:07:59.870 --> 02:08:01.250
Ok…

02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:07.610
Again, “My weigh…My weigh…is seventy-five
kilograms.”

02:08:07.610 --> 02:08:08.610
‘X’ again.

02:08:08.610 --> 02:08:09.929
Don’t use that.

02:08:09.929 --> 02:08:11.510
“What’s your weight?”

02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:13.969
“My weight is seventy-five kilograms.”

02:08:13.969 --> 02:08:15.570
Don’t use this.

02:08:15.570 --> 02:08:18.510
Ok, it’s a little bit confusing.

02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:21.650
Especially the ‘weigh’ and the ‘weight’.

02:08:21.650 --> 02:08:22.650
Takes a lot of practice.

02:08:22.650 --> 02:08:25.639
Ok, I’m going to say these again, really
fast.

02:08:25.639 --> 02:08:27.360
So, listen carefully.

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:30.160
“How much do you weigh?”

02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:33.010
“I weigh seventy-five kilograms.”

02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:36.170
“How much do you weigh?”

02:08:36.170 --> 02:08:38.920
“I weigh seventy-five kilograms.”

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:42.310
“What’s your weight?”

02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:45.500
“My weight is seventy-five kilograms.”

02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:48.120
“What’s your weight?”

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:51.420
“My weight is seventy-five kilograms.”

02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:55.570
Ok, let’s look at a few example sentences.

02:08:55.570 --> 02:08:59.550
Alright, the first example sentence…

02:08:59.550 --> 02:09:03.389
“I gained fifteen kilograms over the summer.”

02:09:03.389 --> 02:09:09.190
“I gained fifteen kilograms over the summer.”

02:09:09.190 --> 02:09:12.150
The next one.

02:09:12.150 --> 02:09:14.400
“I’m fat.

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:18.200
I weigh one hundred kilograms.”

02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:20.680
“I’m fat.

02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:25.510
I weigh one hundred kilograms.”

02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:26.670
And the last one.

02:09:26.670 --> 02:09:29.739
“I need to lose forty kilograms.”

02:09:29.739 --> 02:09:34.820
“I need to lose forty kilograms.”

02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:39.620
Ok, let’s talk about the Imperial System,
now.

02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:45.139
So, remember, the Metric System uses kilograms
and grams.

02:09:45.139 --> 02:09:50.480
The Imperial System…it’s going to use
ounces and pounds.

02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:51.480
Ok…

02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:53.200
So, let’s take a look.

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.120
Here’s my question, again.

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.810
“How much do you weigh?”

02:09:57.810 --> 02:09:58.810
And before, I…

02:09:58.810 --> 02:10:02.780
I said, “I weigh seventy-five kilograms.”

02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:10.739
Well, in the Imperial System, “I weight
one hundred and sixty-five pound.”

02:10:10.739 --> 02:10:12.540
This means ‘pounds’.

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:16.760
Ok, so let’s take a look at the two systems.

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:22.469
So, again, we use.. in the Metric, ‘grams’,
they’re going to use ‘ounce’.

02:10:22.469 --> 02:10:27.380
So one ounce is about…about twenty-eight
grams.

02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:28.380
Ok…

02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:36.780
And one pound is about point four five kilograms.

02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:37.780
Ok…

02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:41.890
So, these are not exact numbers, it’s just
‘around’.

02:10:41.890 --> 02:10:42.890
Ok…

02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:46.030
Now, how to write one pound…

02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:48.370
This is “one pound”.

02:10:48.370 --> 02:10:49.370
Ok…

02:10:49.370 --> 02:10:50.580
This is not a ‘one’.

02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:53.620
This is actually an ‘l’.
‘l-b’

02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:55.530
‘l-b’
One ‘l-b’.

02:10:55.530 --> 02:10:58.800
That means “one pound”.

02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:01.910
Now ‘pound’ starts with ‘p’.

02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:06.870
So, why do they write ‘l-b’?

02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:11.560
Well ‘l-b’ is actually from old latin.

02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:16.880
It comes from a latin term; libra pondo.

02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.190
But, don’t worry about the latin term.

02:11:21.190 --> 02:11:25.060
That’s very old, but still, these days,
we use ‘l-b’.

02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:26.900
That just means ‘pound’.

02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:30.070
So, “one pound.”

02:11:30.070 --> 02:11:32.239
Ok, this is single, ‘one’.

02:11:32.239 --> 02:11:33.580
Now we got two.

02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:34.580
“Pounds.”

02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:38.020
We usually write the ‘s’.
‘l-b-s’.

02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:40.260
“One pound.”

02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:42.489
“Two pounds.”

02:11:42.489 --> 02:11:43.640
For the ‘ounces’.

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:46.140
‘One’ ‘oh’ ‘zee’.

02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:49.480
Ok, ‘one’ ‘oh’ ‘zee’.

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:51.140
“One ounce.”

02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:52.810
“One ounce.”

02:11:52.810 --> 02:11:54.480
“Two ounce.”

02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:01.130
It’s always ‘oh’ ‘zee’
Sometimes you’re going to see ‘one’

02:12:01.130 --> 02:12:03.270
‘f-l-o-z’.

02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:08.410
Now, the ‘f-l’ means ‘fluid’.

02:12:08.410 --> 02:12:11.360
Fluid is like a liquid.

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.159
Like water.

02:12:13.159 --> 02:12:18.290
“Fluid…ounce”
And you’re always going to see this on stuff

02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:21.620
like perfume or cologne.

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:27.909
Ahhh…if you check your perfume or cologne
at home, I’m sure you’re going to see

02:12:27.909 --> 02:12:29.719
this.

02:12:29.719 --> 02:12:32.370
Ahhh…you’re not going to see the ‘one’.

02:12:32.370 --> 02:12:36.400
It’s going to be a bigger number, but you’re
going to see the ‘f-l-o-z’.

02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.570
Alright, so that’s the Imperial System.

02:12:39.570 --> 02:12:41.770
It’s an older system.

02:12:41.770 --> 02:12:44.940
It’s a little more complicated and confusing.

02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:45.989
Alright…

02:12:45.989 --> 02:12:52.060
But my weight in the Imperial System is “a
hundred and sixty-five pound.”

02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:59.710
Let’s take a look at a few more examples
of how to express weight in the Imperial System.

02:12:59.710 --> 02:13:02.400
Alright, the first example…

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:06.800
“A baby weighs nine pounds at birth.”

02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:13.489
“A baby weighs nine pounds at birth.”

02:13:13.489 --> 02:13:15.270
The next example.

02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:20.179
“The fattest cat in the world weighs forty
pounds.”

02:13:20.179 --> 02:13:27.370
“The fattest cat in the world weighs forty
pounds.”

02:13:27.370 --> 02:13:29.210
The last example.

02:13:29.210 --> 02:13:33.290
“His weight is a hundred pounds.”

02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:37.090
“His weight is a hundred pounds.”

02:13:37.090 --> 02:13:39.909
“How much do you weigh?”

02:13:39.909 --> 02:13:43.940
Ok, that’s a very serious and private question.

02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:51.280
Ok, so, if you don’t want to answer that
question, maybe you should say, “no comment”.

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:56.000
Anyway, we learned how to express weight in
the Metric System.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.440
“I weigh seventy-five kilograms.”

02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:01.470
And the Imperial System.

02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:05.260
“I weigh a hundred and sixty-five pounds.”

02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:11.010
Ahhh, of course, the Metric System is easier
than the Imperial System.

02:14:11.010 --> 02:14:12.429
To know and study.

02:14:12.429 --> 02:14:16.530
But, you should be familiar with both systems.

02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:22.630
Alright, so that’s it and I’ll see you
next video.

02:14:22.630 --> 02:14:31.760
Whew….ahhh, it’s sure hot in this studio.

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:33.929
And it sounds like a good time to talk about
temperature.

02:14:33.929 --> 02:14:36.680
So, that’s what we’re going to do in this
video.

02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:40.870
We’re going to talk about how to express
‘temperature’ in English.

02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:44.020
Now, you should know there’s two systems.

02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:46.350
There’s the American system.

02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:47.710
They use ‘Fahrenheit’.

02:14:47.710 --> 02:14:54.380
And, of course, there’s the system we use
in Korea and I use in Canada; ‘Celsius’.

02:14:54.380 --> 02:15:01.050
Ok, we’re going to talk about the Fahrenheit
System, later, but first, let’s focus on

02:15:01.050 --> 02:15:02.460
‘Celsius’.

02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:04.570
So, look at the board.

02:15:04.570 --> 02:15:07.310
And…I’m going to start with this question.

02:15:07.310 --> 02:15:08.830
“What’s the temperature?”

02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:11.600
“What’s the temperature outside?”

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.530
You should begin your answer with “It’s”.

02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:15.820
Ok, “What’s the temperature?”

02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:19.610
“It’s…”, and I have many ways to express
the temperature.

02:15:19.610 --> 02:15:20.989
Let’s start up here.

02:15:20.989 --> 02:15:22.530
So, “What’s the temperature?”

02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:25.130
“It’s…”, this symbol means ‘plus’.

02:15:25.130 --> 02:15:26.130
Ok…

02:15:26.130 --> 02:15:27.130
“Plus.”

02:15:27.130 --> 02:15:29.690
This means it is above zero degrees.

02:15:29.690 --> 02:15:32.200
Ok, it’s warm.

02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:35.150
“It’s plus twenty degrees…”

02:15:35.150 --> 02:15:39.660
Ok, this symbol always means ‘degrees’.

02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.139
“…Celsius.”

02:15:41.139 --> 02:15:42.620
“Celsius.”

02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:44.090
“Celsius.”

02:15:44.090 --> 02:15:45.570
Ok…

02:15:45.570 --> 02:15:48.770
It’s very difficult to say.

02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:49.810
“Celsius.”

02:15:49.810 --> 02:15:53.100
‘Celsius’ is spelled with a capital ‘c’.

02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:54.159
Big ‘c’.

02:15:54.159 --> 02:15:55.450
Be careful here.

02:15:55.450 --> 02:15:57.170
Many people write a ‘c’.

02:15:57.170 --> 02:15:58.610
This is an ‘s’.

02:15:58.610 --> 02:15:59.610
Ok…

02:15:59.610 --> 02:16:00.699
So, “What’s the temperature?”

02:16:00.699 --> 02:16:02.880
“It’s plus twenty degrees celsius.”

02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:07.500
Ok, that’s a good way to express the temperature.

02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:14.080
Now, the ‘plus’…some people say ‘plus’,
but you don’t have to say ‘plus’.

02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:16.940
Ok, you can just say, “What’s the temperature?”

02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:19.510
“It’s twenty degrees Celsius.”

02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:21.370
It means the same thing.

02:16:21.370 --> 02:16:22.989
Let’s move down here.

02:16:22.989 --> 02:16:23.989
The next one.

02:16:23.989 --> 02:16:24.989
“What’s the temperature?”

02:16:24.989 --> 02:16:27.659
“It’s twenty degrees centigrade.”

02:16:27.659 --> 02:16:29.260
“Centigrade?”

02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.370
What is that?

02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:35.010
Well, ‘Celsius’ and ‘Centigrade’…these
are the same temperatures.

02:16:35.010 --> 02:16:39.149
Ok, just ‘Centigrade’ is the old English
style.

02:16:39.149 --> 02:16:40.149
Ok…

02:16:40.149 --> 02:16:43.739
So, actually, I don’t want you to say “Centigrade”.

02:16:43.739 --> 02:16:47.289
I want you to only use “Celsius”.

02:16:47.289 --> 02:16:51.639
But I’m teaching you might hear ‘Centigrade’.

02:16:51.639 --> 02:16:54.099
Some older people might say “Centigrade”.

02:16:54.099 --> 02:17:00.229
Ok, so you hear “Centigrade”, but you
speak only “Celsius”.

02:17:00.229 --> 02:17:01.229
Alright…

02:17:01.229 --> 02:17:03.229
Let’s move to the next one.

02:17:03.229 --> 02:17:05.080
Ahhh, “What’s the temperature?”

02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:07.579
“It’s twenty degrees ‘c’.”

02:17:07.579 --> 02:17:09.279
“It’s twenty degrees ‘c’.”

02:17:09.279 --> 02:17:14.129
Ok, some people are going to shorten ‘Celsius’
to just ‘c’.

02:17:14.129 --> 02:17:15.949
“It’s twenty degrees ‘c’.”

02:17:15.949 --> 02:17:24.040
And, actually, more common…we can shorten
that more and cut that.

02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:28.099
And this is the most common way to express
the temperature.

02:17:28.099 --> 02:17:29.979
“What’s the temperature?”

02:17:29.979 --> 02:17:32.500
“It’s twenty degrees.”

02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:33.569
Ok…

02:17:33.569 --> 02:17:36.409
So when people say, “It’s twenty degrees.”

02:17:36.409 --> 02:17:38.590
I know it’s ‘celsius’.

02:17:38.590 --> 02:17:41.489
And I know it’s ‘plus’.

02:17:41.489 --> 02:17:42.789
Ok…

02:17:42.789 --> 02:17:43.949
This one…ahhh…

02:17:43.949 --> 02:17:46.130
“What’s the temperature?”

02:17:46.130 --> 02:17:47.920
“It’s twenty above.”

02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:49.460
“Twenty above.”

02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:53.840
Ok, so ‘zero degrees’….and twenty above.

02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:55.929
“Twenty degrees above zero.”

02:17:55.929 --> 02:17:57.619
So, “What’s the temperature?”

02:17:57.619 --> 02:17:59.000
“It’s twenty above.”

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
This.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
This.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
This.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000
This.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
They’re all the same temperature.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Ok…

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
“Zero degrees.”

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Freezing.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000
We’re getting cold.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.960
Let’s go down here.

02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:11.840
“What’s the temperature?”

02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:13.239
“It’s twenty below.”

02:18:13.239 --> 02:18:16.899
Ok, so this is ‘above’ zero.

02:18:16.899 --> 02:18:18.779
And this is below ‘zero degrees’.

02:18:18.779 --> 02:18:20.879
So, ‘zero’, going down…cold.

02:18:20.879 --> 02:18:23.010
“It’s twenty below.”

02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:24.119
Very cold.

02:18:24.119 --> 02:18:26.439
Let’s move to the last one.

02:18:26.439 --> 02:18:28.239
“What’s the temperature?”

02:18:28.239 --> 02:18:31.479
“It’s…”, this symbol is ‘minus’.

02:18:31.479 --> 02:18:32.989
This is ‘plus’.

02:18:32.989 --> 02:18:34.159
This is ‘minus’.

02:18:34.159 --> 02:18:37.340
‘Minus’ is very scary cause it’s freezing.

02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:38.340
It’s cold.

02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:43.160
“It’s minus twenty degrees celsius.”

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:48.679
If you told me that “It’s minus twenty
degrees Celsius outside,” I do not want

02:18:48.679 --> 02:18:49.760
to go outside.

02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.170
That’s very cold.

02:18:51.170 --> 02:18:54.189
So, “What’s the temperature?”

02:18:54.189 --> 02:18:56.429
“It’s twenty degrees.”

02:18:56.429 --> 02:18:58.319
“What’s the temperature?”

02:18:58.319 --> 02:19:00.499
“It’s minus twenty degrees.”

02:19:00.499 --> 02:19:03.809
Ok, those are the best ways to express it.

02:19:03.809 --> 02:19:07.029
Alright, so I hope you understand how to express
‘Celsius’.

02:19:07.029 --> 02:19:11.479
Ahhh, let’s look at a few more examples.

02:19:11.479 --> 02:19:13.979
Alright, the first example…

02:19:13.979 --> 02:19:19.899
“The temperature outside is fifteen degrees
Celsius.”

02:19:19.899 --> 02:19:26.099
“The temperature outside is fifteen degrees
Celsius.”

02:19:26.099 --> 02:19:28.840
The next example.

02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:34.099
“Water freezes at zero degrees ‘c’.”

02:19:34.099 --> 02:19:40.849
“Water freezes at zero degrees ‘c’.”

02:19:40.849 --> 02:19:42.550
And the last example.

02:19:42.550 --> 02:19:44.729
“It’s cold outside.

02:19:44.729 --> 02:19:47.739
It’s about three degrees below zero.”

02:19:47.739 --> 02:19:51.560
“It’s cold outside.

02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:55.510
It’s about three degrees below zero.”

02:19:55.510 --> 02:20:00.500
Now, we’re going to talk about what they
use in America.

02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:02.329
In the U.S.A.

02:20:02.329 --> 02:20:03.989
They don’t use ‘Celsius’.

02:20:03.989 --> 02:20:05.760
They use Fahrenheit.”

02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:06.870
Ok…

02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:08.819
So, same question.

02:20:08.819 --> 02:20:09.819
“What’s the temperature?”

02:20:09.819 --> 02:20:12.439
“What’s the temperature outside?”

02:20:12.439 --> 02:20:19.239
“It’s sixty-eight degrees…,” that’s
the same, “f”.

02:20:19.239 --> 02:20:22.189
Instead of ‘c’, they’re going to use
an ‘f’.

02:20:22.189 --> 02:20:26.729
And that’s “Sixty-eight degrees…”,
this is the spelling, oh it’s very difficult

02:20:26.729 --> 02:20:29.510
to spell, even for me.

02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:30.510
“Fahrenheit”.

02:20:30.510 --> 02:20:33.659
Ok, we pronounce that “Fahrenheit”.

02:20:33.659 --> 02:20:42.899
So, “Twenty-degrees Celsius,” is the same
as “Sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit”.

02:20:42.899 --> 02:20:43.899
Ok…

02:20:43.899 --> 02:20:47.580
And you should also know…freezing…the
freezing temperature.

02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:55.609
“Zero degrees Celsius,” is the same as
“Thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit”.

02:20:55.609 --> 02:21:01.340
Alright, so if you go to the U.S.A., and you’re
watching TV, all the weather, everything,

02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:03.090
they’re always using Fahrenheit.

02:21:03.090 --> 02:21:05.670
And it can be very confusing.

02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:08.819
So, I would say, try to remember this.

02:21:08.819 --> 02:21:11.489
So, you can kind of guess how hot it is.

02:21:11.489 --> 02:21:16.249
Alright, let’s look at a few examples of
Fahrenheit.

02:21:16.249 --> 02:21:17.419
The first example…

02:21:17.419 --> 02:21:26.129
“A human’s body temperature is usually
ninety-eight point six degrees Fahrenheit.”

02:21:26.129 --> 02:21:34.890
“A human’s body temperature is usually
ninety-eight point six degrees Fahrenheit.”

02:21:34.890 --> 02:21:39.070
The second example…

02:21:39.070 --> 02:21:44.119
“Room temperature is about seventy degrees
Fahrenheit.”

02:21:44.119 --> 02:21:54.329
“Room temperature is about seventy degrees
Fahrenheit.”

02:21:54.329 --> 02:21:56.529
And the last example…

02:21:56.529 --> 02:21:59.760
“Water freezes at thirty-two degrees.”

02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:05.250
“Water freezes at thirty-two degrees.”

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:08.399
Alright, so there you go.

02:22:08.399 --> 02:22:12.479
There’s the Celsius System and the Fahrenheit
System.

02:22:12.479 --> 02:22:16.640
Ahhh, they’re very very different and they
can be very confusing.

02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:23.209
Alright, so, if you’re going to the U.S.A.,
you should try to…ahh…learn the Fahrenheit

02:22:23.209 --> 02:22:24.209
System.

02:22:24.209 --> 02:22:28.369
Anyway, I hope you understood what I was trying
to teach you today..ahhh..

02:22:28.369 --> 02:22:30.629
That’s it.

02:22:30.629 --> 02:22:33.689
See you next time.

02:22:33.689 --> 02:22:38.930
Hello, everyone.

02:22:38.930 --> 02:22:43.090
In this video, I’m going to talk about roman
numerals.

02:22:43.090 --> 02:22:48.850
So, roman numerals are letters that mean numbers.

02:22:48.850 --> 02:22:53.600
Roman numerals are not so common, but you
can see them every day.

02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:58.399
Ok, so especially, on a clock or a watch.

02:22:58.399 --> 02:23:00.560
They often use roman numerals.

02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:06.600
Ahhh.. in.. on book volumes and chapters of
books, they use roman numerals…

02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:08.229
ahhh.. a lot of the time.

02:23:08.229 --> 02:23:13.239
The Olympics usually express the year in roman
numerals.

02:23:13.239 --> 02:23:20.010
Ok, so you will see roman numerals, so you
should know, at least the first ten.

02:23:20.010 --> 02:23:21.010
Ok…

02:23:21.010 --> 02:23:23.399
Now, let’s take a look here.

02:23:23.399 --> 02:23:25.919
I wrote the first ten.

02:23:25.919 --> 02:23:28.029
And you can see the first one, ‘I’.

02:23:28.029 --> 02:23:32.060
Now, ‘I’ is written like this and this
means ‘one’.

02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:36.090
And the second one is ‘I-I’; ‘two’.

02:23:36.090 --> 02:23:38.609
The third one.

02:23:38.609 --> 02:23:40.369
‘I-I-I’; ‘three’.

02:23:40.369 --> 02:23:45.390
So, one two and three.. so those are the very…the
easiest ones.

02:23:45.390 --> 02:23:48.800
Ok, after that, it gets a little more difficult.

02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:51.529
So, one two three.

02:23:51.529 --> 02:23:54.380
And the next one is ‘four’.

02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:56.840
And it looks like this ‘I-V’.

02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:57.939
Now what is ‘V’?

02:23:57.939 --> 02:24:01.330
Well, quickly, let’s go to ‘five’.

02:24:01.330 --> 02:24:04.149
And you can see ‘V’ is ‘five’.

02:24:04.149 --> 02:24:06.249
Alright, ‘V’ is ‘five’.

02:24:06.249 --> 02:24:07.590
So, let’s go back.

02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:09.930
‘V’
We know this is ‘five’.

02:24:09.930 --> 02:24:11.449
And ‘I’.

02:24:11.449 --> 02:24:14.090
So ‘I’ is ‘one’.

02:24:14.090 --> 02:24:17.680
So ‘I’ is one before ‘five’.

02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:20.050
And that’s ‘four’.

02:24:20.050 --> 02:24:21.050
Ok…

02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:26.930
So one…one number before five is four.

02:24:26.930 --> 02:24:28.560
And then ‘five’.

02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:30.760
Let’s go to the next side.

02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:32.040
Six seven eight nine ten.

02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:36.880
Now, if you notice…I…I wrote them a little
bit different.

02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:40.140
Let’s go down here first.

02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:44.140
Now you can write the roman numeral two styles.

02:24:44.140 --> 02:24:48.640
One style is with a line at the top and the
bottom.

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:51.180
And another style, there’s no line.

02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:54.130
Ok, this and this mean the same thing.

02:24:54.130 --> 02:24:56.840
So this is ‘one’ and this is ‘one’.

02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:58.880
You can see that again with ‘five’.

02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:03.039
So you can write it with the lines at the
top and the ‘V’.

02:25:03.039 --> 02:25:05.899
Or…no lines, just ‘V’.

02:25:05.899 --> 02:25:09.000
Again, they mean the same thing.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.979
So this side, I wrote the lines.

02:25:11.979 --> 02:25:13.949
This side, I didn’t write the lines.

02:25:13.949 --> 02:25:15.140
Doesn’t matter.

02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:16.140
Alright…

02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:17.140
So let’s continue.

02:25:17.140 --> 02:25:18.140
This was ‘four’.

02:25:18.140 --> 02:25:20.330
This was ‘five’.

02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:21.330
“Six.”

02:25:21.330 --> 02:25:25.409
Now ‘six’, ‘V’ and ‘I’.

02:25:25.409 --> 02:25:27.609
So ‘V’ we know is ‘five’.

02:25:27.609 --> 02:25:29.350
‘I’ we know is ‘one’.

02:25:29.350 --> 02:25:31.699
So, ‘five’ and ‘one’ is ‘six’.

02:25:31.699 --> 02:25:33.640
So, you notice, ‘I-V’.

02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:36.439
‘One’ before ‘five’.

02:25:36.439 --> 02:25:37.829
‘Four’.

02:25:37.829 --> 02:25:39.209
‘V-I’.

02:25:39.209 --> 02:25:40.600
‘Six’.

02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:41.989
‘V-I-I’.

02:25:41.989 --> 02:25:43.379
‘Seven’.

02:25:43.379 --> 02:25:44.770
‘V-I-I-I’.

02:25:44.770 --> 02:25:46.159
‘Eight’.

02:25:46.159 --> 02:25:48.770
So, five six seven eight.

02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:52.640
Alright, then it gets complicated again.

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:55.239
‘I-X’ is ‘nine’.

02:25:55.239 --> 02:25:58.430
Ok, so ‘X’, ‘X’ is ‘ten’.

02:25:58.430 --> 02:25:59.430
Ok…

02:25:59.430 --> 02:26:00.619
So like ‘four’.

02:26:00.619 --> 02:26:03.699
‘One’ before ‘five’ is ‘four’.

02:26:03.699 --> 02:26:08.789
One number before ‘ten’ is ‘nine’.

02:26:08.789 --> 02:26:10.850
‘I-X’ that means ‘nine’.

02:26:10.850 --> 02:26:14.020
And, of course, ‘ten’ is ‘X’.

02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:17.920
Alright…let’s move on to some bigger roman
numerals.

02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:20.580
Now, I told you.. ahh..

02:26:20.580 --> 02:26:22.119
‘X’ is ‘ten’.

02:26:22.119 --> 02:26:25.470
Now, ‘X’ and ‘I’.

02:26:25.470 --> 02:26:27.520
So ‘ten’ and ‘one’.

02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.189
That’s ‘eleven’.

02:26:29.189 --> 02:26:30.189
‘X-I-I’.

02:26:30.189 --> 02:26:31.699
That’s ‘twelve’.

02:26:31.699 --> 02:26:32.699
Alright…

02:26:32.699 --> 02:26:37.890
So up until ‘twelve’ are the most common
roman numerals cause those are the ones on

02:26:37.890 --> 02:26:38.890
the clock.

02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:40.249
‘One’ to ‘twelve’.

02:26:40.249 --> 02:26:43.890
So you should really know ‘One’ to ‘twelve’.

02:26:43.890 --> 02:26:44.890
Ok…

02:26:44.890 --> 02:26:47.629
Now, the next ones are not so common.

02:26:47.629 --> 02:26:48.649
Ok…

02:26:48.649 --> 02:26:50.979
You rarely rarely see them.

02:26:50.979 --> 02:26:54.350
But let’s continue anyways.

02:26:54.350 --> 02:26:57.020
So after ‘twelve’, we’re going to jump
to ‘twenty’.

02:26:57.020 --> 02:26:58.850
And ‘twenty’ is ‘X-X’.

02:26:58.850 --> 02:27:00.899
So, ten ten.

02:27:00.899 --> 02:27:03.530
Ten ten means twenty.

02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:05.220
‘X-X-V’.

02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:07.379
We know ‘V’ is ‘five’.

02:27:07.379 --> 02:27:08.470
‘X-X-V’.

02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:09.560
‘Twenty-five’.

02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:12.939
Ok, let’s jump more.

02:27:12.939 --> 02:27:14.529
‘X-X’ is ‘twenty’.

02:27:14.529 --> 02:27:15.529
‘X-X-X’.

02:27:15.529 --> 02:27:16.529
‘Thirty’.

02:27:16.529 --> 02:27:19.539
And then the next one.

02:27:19.539 --> 02:27:21.209
‘X-L’
‘X-L’ is ‘forty’.

02:27:21.209 --> 02:27:24.159
Well, what is ‘L’?

02:27:24.159 --> 02:27:26.739
‘L’ is ‘fifty’.

02:27:26.739 --> 02:27:30.109
So, ‘X’ is ‘ten’.

02:27:30.109 --> 02:27:32.949
Again, ten before fifty.

02:27:32.949 --> 02:27:36.369
So, ten before fifty is ‘forty’.

02:27:36.369 --> 02:27:38.010
So this means ‘forty’.

02:27:38.010 --> 02:27:39.600
Ten before fifty.

02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:41.629
‘L’ is ‘fifty’.

02:27:41.629 --> 02:27:42.629
‘L-I’.

02:27:42.629 --> 02:27:43.629
‘Fifty-one’.

02:27:43.629 --> 02:27:44.629
‘Fifty-one’.

02:27:44.629 --> 02:27:45.629
‘X-C’ is ‘ninety’.

02:27:45.629 --> 02:27:53.970
Well, what is ‘C’?
‘C’ is ‘one hundred’.

02:27:53.970 --> 02:27:58.810
So, ‘X’ is ten before one hundred.

02:27:58.810 --> 02:28:02.169
So, ten before one hundred is ‘ninety’.

02:28:02.169 --> 02:28:04.899
And of course, ‘C’, ‘one hundred’.

02:28:04.899 --> 02:28:08.569
Ok, so again, these ones are not so common.

02:28:08.569 --> 02:28:11.239
So, you don’t have to worry about this so
much.

02:28:11.239 --> 02:28:14.659
But anyway, let’s continue to some bigger
roman numerals

02:28:14.659 --> 02:28:19.079
Ok, so here are some bigger roman numerals.

02:28:19.079 --> 02:28:22.970
Now, we know ‘C’ is ‘one hundred’.

02:28:22.970 --> 02:28:24.800
Let’s go to this one.

02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:27.620
‘C-D’.
‘C-D’ is ‘four hundred’.

02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:29.470
Well, what is ‘D’?

02:28:29.470 --> 02:28:32.270
‘D’ is ‘five hundred’.

02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:38.090
So, ‘C-D’ means one hundred before five
hundred.

02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:41.020
So, that is ‘four hundred’.

02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:43.169
‘Five hundred’
‘M’.

02:28:43.169 --> 02:28:48.060
‘M’ is the last letter we use in roman
numerals.

02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:51.409
‘M’ is ‘one thousand’.
ok…

02:28:51.409 --> 02:28:52.409
‘M-D’.

02:28:52.409 --> 02:28:54.479
Well, ‘D’ is ‘five hundred’.

02:28:54.479 --> 02:28:58.820
‘M’ is ‘one thousand’, so ‘one thousand
five hundred”.

02:28:58.820 --> 02:28:59.820
‘M-D’.

02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:00.820
And the last one here.

02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:03.079
A really big number.

02:29:03.079 --> 02:29:04.470
‘M-D-C-C-C’.

02:29:04.470 --> 02:29:11.319
Ok, so one thousand five hundred…and one
hundred, two hundred, three hundred…the

02:29:11.319 --> 02:29:14.279
total here is eighteen hundred.

02:29:14.279 --> 02:29:15.279
Ok…

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:17.560
So that…that’s roman numerals.

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:20.600
Let’s do a little more practice.

02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:25.659
Ok, let’s do a little practice together.

02:29:25.659 --> 02:29:27.010
I know it’s difficult.

02:29:27.010 --> 02:29:30.180
So let’s take a look at these letters.

02:29:30.180 --> 02:29:31.180
‘L-X-V’.

02:29:31.180 --> 02:29:32.689
What is that?

02:29:32.689 --> 02:29:33.689
‘L-X-V’.

02:29:33.689 --> 02:29:36.439
Well, we know ‘L’ is ‘fifty’.

02:29:36.439 --> 02:29:41.120
Oh, but it’s followed by ‘X’.

02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:47.890
So, ‘fifty’ and ‘X’ is ‘ten’,
so fifty plus ten is ‘sixty’.

02:29:47.890 --> 02:29:48.890
And ‘V’.

02:29:48.890 --> 02:29:49.890
What is ‘V’?

02:29:49.890 --> 02:29:51.500
‘V’ is ‘five’.

02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:59.039
So, fifty plus ten is sixty plus ‘V’ is
five.

02:29:59.039 --> 02:30:01.729
So, this….’sixty-five’.

02:30:01.729 --> 02:30:05.649
Alright, the next one.

02:30:05.649 --> 02:30:07.510
‘X-X-I-X’.

02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:09.359
Hmmm…

02:30:09.359 --> 02:30:13.829
Well, we know ‘X’ is ‘ten’.

02:30:13.829 --> 02:30:15.830
And ‘X-X’, ‘ten’, ‘ten’.

02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:16.830
‘Twenty’.

02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:17.859
And ‘one’.

02:30:17.859 --> 02:30:18.859
“Twenty-one’.

02:30:18.859 --> 02:30:19.859
‘X’.

02:30:19.859 --> 02:30:22.350
Ohhh…this is confusing.

02:30:22.350 --> 02:30:24.729
Ahhh…first we have to look at these.

02:30:24.729 --> 02:30:27.069
Ok, what is this number?

02:30:27.069 --> 02:30:28.510
‘I-X’?

02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:32.819
Well, ‘I-X’ is…uhhh…’nine’.

02:30:32.819 --> 02:30:35.709
One before ‘X’ is ‘nine’.

02:30:35.709 --> 02:30:39.100
So, ‘X-X’ is ‘twenty’ and ‘nine’.

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:41.419
So, ‘twenty-nine’.
‘C-V’.

02:30:41.419 --> 02:30:42.970
Well, ‘C’…

02:30:42.970 --> 02:30:44.510
What’s ‘C’?

02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:46.840
That’s a hundred.

02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:48.149
And what’s ‘V’?

02:30:48.149 --> 02:30:49.149
That’s five.

02:30:49.149 --> 02:30:53.199
So, a hundred plus five.

02:30:53.199 --> 02:30:54.709
‘C-V’.

02:30:54.709 --> 02:30:58.869
‘A hundred and five’.

02:30:58.869 --> 02:31:00.010
Next one.

02:31:00.010 --> 02:31:01.010
‘C-C-D’.

02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:02.010
‘C-C-D’.

02:31:02.010 --> 02:31:04.739
Well, ‘C’ is ‘a hundred’.

02:31:04.739 --> 02:31:07.930
And, ‘C-C’ that’s ‘two hundred’.

02:31:07.930 --> 02:31:10.100
And what was ‘D’?

02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:12.609
‘D’ was ‘five hundred’.

02:31:12.609 --> 02:31:13.939
So, ‘C-C-D’.

02:31:13.939 --> 02:31:18.020
That’s ‘two hundred’ before ‘five
hundred’.

02:31:18.020 --> 02:31:21.029
‘Two hundred’ before ‘five hundred’.

02:31:21.029 --> 02:31:24.930
That must be ‘three hundred’.

02:31:24.930 --> 02:31:29.250
Ahhh…ok, but ‘C-C-D’, I tricked you.

02:31:29.250 --> 02:31:31.140
‘C-C-D’ is impossible.

02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:36.260
‘Three hundred’ can only be ‘C-C-C’.

02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:37.979
Alright…

02:31:37.979 --> 02:31:40.959
‘C-C-D’ that is impossible.

02:31:40.959 --> 02:31:41.959
That is wrong.

02:31:41.959 --> 02:31:45.720
You can only write ‘three hundred’ as
‘C-C-D’…or ‘C-C-C’.

02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:47.279
You cannot write it ‘C-C-D’.

02:31:47.279 --> 02:31:51.120
Alright, the last one.

02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.120
‘M-M-X-I-I’.

02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:53.120
‘M’.

02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:54.590
‘One thousand’.

02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:55.590
‘M’.

02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:57.189
‘One thousand’.

02:31:57.189 --> 02:32:00.439
Two ‘M’s, ‘two thousand’.

02:32:00.439 --> 02:32:01.489
‘X’.

02:32:01.489 --> 02:32:02.539
‘Ten’.

02:32:02.539 --> 02:32:04.629
‘I-I’
‘Twelve’.

02:32:04.629 --> 02:32:07.999
So, this going to be ‘two thousand’.

02:32:07.999 --> 02:32:09.350
We know that.

02:32:09.350 --> 02:32:12.680
‘X-I-I’, that’s ‘twelve’.

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:13.790
Oops.

02:32:13.790 --> 02:32:17.119
Put them together.

02:32:17.119 --> 02:32:18.399
That is a year.

02:32:18.399 --> 02:32:19.810
‘Two thousand twelve’.

02:32:19.810 --> 02:32:24.039
It is written ‘M-M-X-I-I’.

02:32:24.039 --> 02:32:29.249
Alright, so that’s roman numerals.

02:32:29.249 --> 02:32:33.670
Again, you only need to know, probably ‘one’
to ‘twelve’.

02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:35.050
Those are the most common.

02:32:35.050 --> 02:32:40.629
Ahhh… probably, you’ll never have to worry
about these roman numerals in your life.

02:32:40.629 --> 02:32:43.620
Ok, but this is just for fun, so you know.

02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:45.359
Alright, that’s it.

02:32:45.359 --> 02:32:48.289
See you next time.

02:32:48.289 --> 02:32:53.430
Hello, everyone.

02:32:53.430 --> 02:32:58.520
In this video, we are going to talk about
how to express your phone number.

02:32:58.520 --> 02:32:59.520
Alright…

02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:01.829
So, here’s the question.

02:33:01.829 --> 02:33:03.239
“What’s your phone number?”

02:33:03.239 --> 02:33:04.819
“What’s your phone number?”

02:33:04.819 --> 02:33:07.350
Very important question.

02:33:07.350 --> 02:33:10.169
And the first number I wrote here is very
big.

02:33:10.169 --> 02:33:11.169
Ok…

02:33:11.169 --> 02:33:12.209
It has many parts.

02:33:12.209 --> 02:33:15.450
So, let’s look at the first part.

02:33:15.450 --> 02:33:19.310
The first part here is called your ‘country
code’.

02:33:19.310 --> 02:33:20.310
Ok…

02:33:20.310 --> 02:33:25.169
So, the country code of Korea is ‘eighty-two’.

02:33:25.169 --> 02:33:31.330
So if someone is calling from another country,
they have to put your country code ‘eighty-two’.

02:33:31.330 --> 02:33:37.379
Ahhh… in Canada and the U.S.A., the country
code is ‘one’.

02:33:37.379 --> 02:33:39.870
The next is the ‘area code’.

02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:44.739
Now, in Korea I don’t think there’s an
area code ‘fifty-seven’.

02:33:44.739 --> 02:33:50.879
But, there….Seoul has an area code of ‘zero
two’.

02:33:50.879 --> 02:33:57.169
And I think Busan… the area code of Busan
is ‘five one’.

02:33:57.169 --> 02:34:03.120
So if your calling to a specific city, you
should put the area code.

02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:04.239
Alright…

02:34:04.239 --> 02:34:05.640
And then, the number.

02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:09.490
So to express numbers, you just say the number.

02:34:09.490 --> 02:34:16.409
So this is, “eight-two, five-seven, two-five-three,
six-one-two-one”.

02:34:16.409 --> 02:34:20.430
Ok, very express a number.

02:34:20.430 --> 02:34:23.970
Let’s look at a mobile phone number.

02:34:23.970 --> 02:34:24.970
This is “zero-one-seven”.

02:34:24.970 --> 02:34:29.590
I don’t want you to call real phone numbers.

02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:33.510
So this is just example phone numbers.

02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:38.630
So we would express, “zero-one-seven”.

02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:39.630
“Zero-one-seven.”

02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:44.810
Now if you remember, “zero”, we can also
express as “oh”.

02:34:44.810 --> 02:34:47.810
So, “zero-one-seven.”

02:34:47.810 --> 02:34:49.310
Or…

02:34:49.310 --> 02:34:50.310
“Oh-one-seven.”

02:34:50.310 --> 02:34:51.310
Both are ok.

02:34:51.310 --> 02:34:58.590
And again, you have to be very careful with
“oh” because “oh” sounds like five

02:34:58.590 --> 02:34:59.699
in Korean.

02:34:59.699 --> 02:35:05.869
Alright, so, if someone says “oh”, don’t
write down ‘five’; write down ‘zero’.

02:35:05.869 --> 02:35:10.919
Ok, so, “Zero-one-seven, three-four-four-two,
four-six-six-six.”

02:35:10.919 --> 02:35:14.699
Ok, that’s the phone number.

02:35:14.699 --> 02:35:18.779
“Zero-one-seven, three-four-four-two, four-six-six-six.”

02:35:18.779 --> 02:35:26.899
Ok, now there’s and easier way that a native
speaker would express this number.

02:35:26.899 --> 02:35:28.090
If you look here.

02:35:28.090 --> 02:35:30.720
There are two ‘fours’.

02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:31.859
Ok…

02:35:31.859 --> 02:35:36.359
So a native speaker…ahh… well they might
say, “three-four-four-two”.

02:35:36.359 --> 02:35:38.069
That’s fine.

02:35:38.069 --> 02:35:39.710
But another way…

02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:43.590
“Three…” and we would say, “double
four”.

02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:45.270
Cause there’s two ‘fours’.

02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:46.270
That’s double.

02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:48.950
So “three- double four-two.”

02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:52.899
Ok, so that’s another way to express that
number.

02:35:52.899 --> 02:35:54.960
And if you look over here.

02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:56.109
Ahh…”four-six-six-six.”

02:35:56.109 --> 02:36:00.229
That’s fine to express the number that way.

02:36:00.229 --> 02:36:07.819
But if you see three ‘sixes’, that’s
triple, so you could say, “four- triple

02:36:07.819 --> 02:36:08.819
six”.

02:36:08.819 --> 02:36:11.619
Ok, so, “What’s your phone number?”

02:36:11.619 --> 02:36:17.529
“Zero-one-seven, three- double four, two-four-
triple six”.

02:36:17.529 --> 02:36:25.180
“Zero-one-seven, three- double four, two-four-
triple six”.

02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:28.550
Ok, that’s another way to express that number.

02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:31.270
Let’s move on to the last one.

02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:37.109
The last one is a nightmare…because it has
‘five’ and ‘oh’.

02:36:37.109 --> 02:36:40.470
Many ‘fives’ and ‘oh’ to get confused.

02:36:40.470 --> 02:36:42.060
Don’t get confused.

02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:44.510
So, this number…

02:36:44.510 --> 02:36:49.800
“Oh-one-seven, five-oh-five-oh, oh-five-five-oh.”

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:51.560
Ok…

02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:56.850
“Oh-one-seven, five-oh-five-oh, oh-five-five-oh.”

02:36:56.850 --> 02:37:06.340
Alright, so if you don’t want to be confused,
you could say, “zero-one-seven, five-zero-five-zero,

02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:08.729
zero-five-five-zero.”

02:37:08.729 --> 02:37:13.189
So, again, you can say, “oh”, or “zero”.

02:37:13.189 --> 02:37:17.540
Alright, so that’s how to express a phone
number.

02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:20.000
Let’s do a little test.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.039
A little listening test right now.

02:37:22.039 --> 02:37:25.539
I want you to listen to some phone numbers.

02:37:25.539 --> 02:37:28.979
Ok, so there are four numbers here I’m going
to ask you.

02:37:28.979 --> 02:37:30.770
The first one.

02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:33.510
Listen carefully.

02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:41.109
“Zero-one-seven, five-six-three-four, seven-four-five-four.”

02:37:41.109 --> 02:37:49.029
“Zero-one-seven, five-six-three-four, seven-four-five-four.”

02:37:49.029 --> 02:37:54.869
Ok, should look like this.

02:37:54.869 --> 02:37:56.670
Number two.

02:37:56.670 --> 02:38:04.050
“Zero-one seven, one-six-five-seven, four-five-six-five.”

02:38:04.050 --> 02:38:11.399
“Zero-one seven, one-six-five-seven, four-five-six-five.”

02:38:11.399 --> 02:38:17.729
Ok, it should look like this.

02:38:17.729 --> 02:38:20.050
Number three.

02:38:20.050 --> 02:38:28.300
“Zero-one seven, five-oh-oh-five, oh-oh-five-oh.”

02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:36.550
“Zero-one seven, five-oh-oh-five, oh-oh-five-oh.”

02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:41.789
Ok, should look like this.

02:38:41.789 --> 02:38:43.439
And the last number.

02:38:43.439 --> 02:38:49.430
“Zero-one seven, double two- double three,
triple five- one.”

02:38:49.430 --> 02:38:57.779
“Zero-one seven, double two- double three,
triple five- one.”

02:38:57.779 --> 02:39:02.270
Ok, that one was difficult.

02:39:02.270 --> 02:39:07.069
It should look like this.

02:39:07.069 --> 02:39:14.109
Ok, so that’s how you express phone numbers.

02:39:14.109 --> 02:39:19.710
ok, again, if you want to know someone’s
phone number, yyou just ask the question,

02:39:19.710 --> 02:39:21.680
“What’s your phone number?”.

02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:27.829
And if someone asks you for your phone number,
you just answer, “It’s…”.

02:39:27.829 --> 02:39:29.600
And then you say the numbers.

02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:30.600
Alright…

02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:32.770
So, that’s it for phone numbers.

02:39:32.770 --> 02:39:37.710
Ahh…before I go, I would like to tell you
my phone number, so you can call me anytime

02:39:37.710 --> 02:39:41.810
of the day, or night to ask me English questions.

02:39:41.810 --> 02:39:46.880
So, “my phone number is zero-one-zero, four-seven”.

02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:51.050
Hello, everyone.

02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:56.510
In this video, I’m going to talk about numbers.

02:39:56.510 --> 02:40:04.689
Ahh…more specifically, things like apartment
numbers, bus numbers and flight numbers.

02:40:04.689 --> 02:40:09.600
Ok, we express these numbers differently in
English.

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:11.590
Let’s take a look.

02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:14.159
So, the first is apartment.

02:40:14.159 --> 02:40:15.760
Your apartment number.

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:22.520
So this could be your apartment number or
house number or villa number.

02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:23.520
Bus number.

02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:25.289
Taxi number.

02:40:25.289 --> 02:40:26.569
Subway number.

02:40:26.569 --> 02:40:28.109
Flight number.

02:40:28.109 --> 02:40:32.829
Ok, so, these kinds of things, we express
the numbers differently.

02:40:32.829 --> 02:40:35.949
Let’s take a look.

02:40:35.949 --> 02:40:36.949
The first one.

02:40:36.949 --> 02:40:38.859
Ok, we…it’s just two numbers.

02:40:38.859 --> 02:40:43.560
We always want to look at the last two numbers.

02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:46.880
So we would say, “apartment number twelve.”

02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:48.659
That one is easy.

02:40:48.659 --> 02:40:50.300
“Apartment number twelve.”

02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:52.800
Let’s move on to the next one.

02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:57.079
Alright, so we want to look at the last two
numbers.

02:40:57.079 --> 02:41:01.119
The last two numbers is “twenty-one”.

02:41:01.119 --> 02:41:02.119
Ok…

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:06.859
So, we would express this as “one twenty-one.”

02:41:06.859 --> 02:41:12.100
Alright, so this could be “apartment number
one twenty-one.”

02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:16.339
It could be “bus number one twenty-one.”

02:41:16.339 --> 02:41:19.880
It could be “flight number one twenty-one.”

02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:24.080
Now, it’s also possible to say, “one-two-one.”

02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:27.749
Ok, “bus number one-two-one.”

02:41:27.749 --> 02:41:28.970
That’s ok.

02:41:28.970 --> 02:41:31.699
But you should learn just to say, “one twenty-one.”

02:41:31.699 --> 02:41:35.459
Ok, that’s very fast and more common.

02:41:35.459 --> 02:41:36.459
The next one.

02:41:36.459 --> 02:41:38.530
Ok, let’s look at the last two numbers.

02:41:38.530 --> 02:41:39.530
“Twelve.”

02:41:39.530 --> 02:41:40.530
“Twelve.”

02:41:40.530 --> 02:41:44.890
So, we would express “apartment number twelve-twelve.”

02:41:44.890 --> 02:41:50.189
“Bus number twelve-twelve.”

02:41:50.189 --> 02:41:57.909
You could also say, “Number one-two-one-two”,
but “twelve-twelve” is more common.

02:41:57.909 --> 02:41:58.909
The next number.

02:41:58.909 --> 02:42:01.119
Ok, the last two are ‘zero-zero’.

02:42:01.119 --> 02:42:02.790
Ok, so we can’t say, “zero”.

02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:08.629
We’re going to just say it all….we’re
going to say this as…ahh…for example “Bus

02:42:08.629 --> 02:42:11.210
number twelve hundred.”

02:42:11.210 --> 02:42:15.379
Ok, “Bus number twelve hundred.”

02:42:15.379 --> 02:42:18.010
The next one.

02:42:18.010 --> 02:42:19.810
The last two numbers ‘fifty-six”.

02:42:19.810 --> 02:42:25.149
So, let’s say, “Flight number four fifty-six.”

02:42:25.149 --> 02:42:27.270
“Flight number four fifty-six.”

02:42:27.270 --> 02:42:32.050
Again, you could also say, “Flight number
four-five-six.”

02:42:32.050 --> 02:42:34.369
That’s ok.

02:42:34.369 --> 02:42:36.699
The next one.

02:42:36.699 --> 02:42:37.930
The last two ‘sixty-seven”.

02:42:37.930 --> 02:42:43.800
So, let’s say, “Bus number forty-five
sixty-seven.”

02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:46.249
“Bus number forty-five sixty-seven.”

02:42:46.249 --> 02:42:48.069
Or…

02:42:48.069 --> 02:42:52.640
You could also say, “four-five-six-seven.”

02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:53.750
The next.

02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:56.890
The last two numbers are ‘zero-seven’.

02:42:56.890 --> 02:43:04.140
So, we could also say instead of ‘zero,
more commonly, we’re going to say, “oh”.

02:43:04.140 --> 02:43:05.140
“Oh-seven.”

02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:09.909
So if I said, “Apartment number forty-oh-seven.”

02:43:09.909 --> 02:43:12.579
“Forty-oh-seven.”

02:43:12.579 --> 02:43:16.729
Ok, and the last number.

02:43:16.729 --> 02:43:20.989
Ahhh…let’s say, “Bus number…”, ‘fifty-two’.

02:43:20.989 --> 02:43:24.410
“Bus number sixteen fifty-two.”

02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:26.720
Ok…

02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.949
Takes a lot of practice to learn how to…ahhh…express
these numbers.

02:43:30.949 --> 02:43:35.720
Let’s take a little…a little quick test
right now and see how you can do.

02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:38.949
Alright, there’s only four questions here.

02:43:38.949 --> 02:43:40.020
Number one.

02:43:40.020 --> 02:43:44.390
“I live in apartment six thirty-two.”

02:43:44.390 --> 02:43:50.319
“I live in apartment six thirty-two.”

02:43:50.319 --> 02:43:53.430
Number two.

02:43:53.430 --> 02:43:58.420
“We need to take bus number thirty-three.”

02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:08.069
“We need to take bus number thirty-three.”

02:44:08.069 --> 02:44:09.310
Number three.

02:44:09.310 --> 02:44:13.420
“My flight number is seventeen-oh-nine.”

02:44:13.420 --> 02:44:21.129
“My flight number is seventeen-oh-nine.”

02:44:21.129 --> 02:44:22.129
And number four.

02:44:22.129 --> 02:44:23.379
The last one.

02:44:23.379 --> 02:44:28.010
“Let’s meet at the subway station number
four sixty-five.”

02:44:28.010 --> 02:44:34.499
“Let’s meet at the subway station number
four sixty-five.”

02:44:34.499 --> 02:44:42.220
Ok, how I hope you did well on the small little
test.

02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:47.939
Ahhh…again, it takes a lot of practice to
be familiar saying these kind of numbers.

02:44:47.939 --> 02:44:48.939
Alright…

02:44:48.939 --> 02:44:51.279
There’s so many different ways to say these
numbers.

02:44:51.279 --> 02:44:54.709
So, I hope you learned something in this video.

02:44:54.709 --> 02:44:59.350
Anyway, I will see you next video.

02:44:59.350 --> 02:45:04.709
Hello, everyone.

02:45:04.709 --> 02:45:10.520
In this video, I’m going to talk about how
to express ratios in English.

02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:12.050
It’s quite easy.

02:45:12.050 --> 02:45:13.319
Let’s take a look.

02:45:13.319 --> 02:45:16.600
I have two examples here.

02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:19.279
The first example is about my party.

02:45:19.279 --> 02:45:20.779
I had a party.

02:45:20.779 --> 02:45:23.579
Ahhh…these are my guests.

02:45:23.579 --> 02:45:25.750
One hundred guests.

02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:29.439
Seventy five of my guests were men.

02:45:29.439 --> 02:45:32.060
Twenty-five of my guests were women.

02:45:32.060 --> 02:45:33.359
So what’s the ratio?

02:45:33.359 --> 02:45:34.649
Well, here it is.

02:45:34.649 --> 02:45:38.100
So, how would I express the ratio?

02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:44.659
Well…ahhh…the simple way is just to say,
“three to one”.

02:45:44.659 --> 02:45:46.539
“Three to one.”

02:45:46.539 --> 02:45:48.880
The colon here, we always say, “to”.

02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:50.129
“Three to one.”

02:45:50.129 --> 02:45:55.100
But let’s make a complete and full sentence.

02:45:55.100 --> 02:46:09.909
So I would say, “The ratio of men to women

02:46:09.909 --> 02:46:14.229
at my party was three to one.”

02:46:14.229 --> 02:46:20.189
Alright, let’s move on to the next example
talking about buttons.

02:46:20.189 --> 02:46:22.630
I got three red buttons.

02:46:22.630 --> 02:46:24.760
Two blue buttons.

02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:25.800
Six black buttons.

02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:29.229
Ok, what’s the ratio of buttons?

02:46:29.229 --> 02:46:31.579
Ok, we’re going to use three numbers.

02:46:31.579 --> 02:46:38.359
And simply, you would say, “three to two
to six.”

02:46:38.359 --> 02:46:41.350
That’s the ratio of buttons.

02:46:41.350 --> 02:46:44.739
“Three to two to six.”

02:46:44.739 --> 02:46:46.279
Ok, easy.

02:46:46.279 --> 02:46:49.149
Let’s take a look at a few more examples.

02:46:49.149 --> 02:46:53.479
Alright, let’s look at the first ratio example.

02:46:53.479 --> 02:47:04.119
“The ratio of boys to girls in China is
a hundred and ten to one hundred.”

02:47:04.119 --> 02:47:14.289
“The ratio of boys to girls in China is
a hundred and ten to one hundred.”

02:47:14.289 --> 02:47:15.680
The next example.

02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:19.829
“There are two apples and three oranges.

02:47:19.829 --> 02:47:24.199
The ratio is two to three.”

02:47:24.199 --> 02:47:29.130
“There are two apples and three oranges.

02:47:29.130 --> 02:47:33.470
The ratio is two to three.”

02:47:33.470 --> 02:47:35.359
And the last example.

02:47:35.359 --> 02:47:44.119
“The ratio of children, teenagers and adults
is seven to three to one.”

02:47:44.119 --> 02:47:53.079
“The ratio of children, teenagers and adults
is seven to three to one.”

02:47:53.079 --> 02:48:01.169
Ok, so I hope you have a better understanding
of how to express ratios in English.

02:48:01.169 --> 02:48:06.800
Uhhh… before we end this video, I just want
to talk about expressing scores.

02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:08.529
Ok…in a game.

02:48:08.529 --> 02:48:13.749
So here is a soccer game between Korea and
Japan.

02:48:13.749 --> 02:48:15.209
And Korea wins.

02:48:15.209 --> 02:48:19.430
They have two goals and Japan only has one
goal.

02:48:19.430 --> 02:48:22.180
So, “What’s the score?”

02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:23.619
You would just say the same.

02:48:23.619 --> 02:48:25.369
“Two to one.”

02:48:25.369 --> 02:48:27.579
“Two to one.”

02:48:27.579 --> 02:48:28.579
Alright…

02:48:28.579 --> 02:48:30.100
That’s easy.

02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:32.279
So that’s how you would express a score.

02:48:32.279 --> 02:48:38.569
Alright, so that’s it for our ratios and
see you next video.

02:48:38.569 --> 02:48:44.159
Hello, again.

02:48:44.159 --> 02:48:49.810
In this video, we’re going to learn how
to express decimal numbers in English.

02:48:49.810 --> 02:48:50.810
And..

02:48:50.810 --> 02:48:52.539
I’ll tell you it’s quite easy.

02:48:52.539 --> 02:48:54.159
let’s look.

02:48:54.159 --> 02:48:57.069
Now here is the decimal point.

02:48:57.069 --> 02:48:59.029
Don’t call it “period”.

02:48:59.029 --> 02:49:00.579
Don’t call it “dot”.

02:49:00.579 --> 02:49:01.729
It’s a “point”.

02:49:01.729 --> 02:49:04.159
It’s called the ‘decimal point’.

02:49:04.159 --> 02:49:09.749
So we would express this number as “one
point one”.

02:49:09.749 --> 02:49:10.749
Easy.

02:49:10.749 --> 02:49:12.859
The next number.

02:49:12.859 --> 02:49:16.619
Ok, we could actually express this number
two ways.

02:49:16.619 --> 02:49:18.619
“One point twelve.”

02:49:18.619 --> 02:49:20.569
“One point twelve.”

02:49:20.569 --> 02:49:21.569
Or…

02:49:21.569 --> 02:49:24.209
“One point one two.”

02:49:24.209 --> 02:49:25.560
Ok…

02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:26.590
The next number.

02:49:26.590 --> 02:49:29.789
“Four hundred point one.”

02:49:29.789 --> 02:49:30.979
Easy.

02:49:30.979 --> 02:49:32.910
The next number.

02:49:32.910 --> 02:49:33.999
Starts with a ‘zero’.

02:49:33.999 --> 02:49:37.129
Again, there’s two ways to express this.

02:49:37.129 --> 02:49:41.800
You could say, “Zero point zero two.”

02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:49.569
Or another common way….because it starts
with a zero, we just start with the point.

02:49:49.569 --> 02:49:53.850
So some people say, “Point zero two.”

02:49:53.850 --> 02:49:54.850
Ok…

02:49:54.850 --> 02:50:00.050
Now remember, “zero” can also be called
“oh”.

02:50:00.050 --> 02:50:05.060
So you could say, “Point oh two.”

02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:06.369
The next number here.

02:50:06.369 --> 02:50:08.569
Ok, we have more numbers.

02:50:08.569 --> 02:50:13.050
So, “Six point zero three three.”

02:50:13.050 --> 02:50:15.859
Or, “Six point oh three three.”

02:50:15.859 --> 02:50:16.859
Ok…

02:50:16.859 --> 02:50:20.590
Ok, let’s move down to the last two numbers
here.

02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:24.659
We have “ten point one” and “ten point
nine”.

02:50:24.659 --> 02:50:30.180
Now, “ten point one” is very close to
‘ten’.

02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:31.180
Ok…

02:50:31.180 --> 02:50:37.810
So, if we change “ten point one”…just
change it to only ‘ten’, that’s called

02:50:37.810 --> 02:50:39.350
’round down’.

02:50:39.350 --> 02:50:40.350
Ok…

02:50:40.350 --> 02:50:41.659
“Round down.”

02:50:41.659 --> 02:50:49.109
So, the closer….’ten point one’ is very
close to ‘ten’, so we take away the ‘point

02:50:49.109 --> 02:50:51.169
one’ and just have ‘ten’.

02:50:51.169 --> 02:50:53.199
“Round down.”

02:50:53.199 --> 02:51:00.680
“Ten point nine” is close…very close
to ‘eleven’, so we change ‘ten point

02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:02.720
nine’ to ‘eleven’.

02:51:02.720 --> 02:51:06.359
That situation is called “round up”.

02:51:06.359 --> 02:51:11.689
Ok, so changing “ten point nine” to ‘eleven’;
round up.

02:51:11.689 --> 02:51:15.919
‘Ten point one’ to ‘ten’; round down.

02:51:15.919 --> 02:51:16.919
Alright…

02:51:16.919 --> 02:51:20.210
So, I hope you understand how to use the decimal
point.

02:51:20.210 --> 02:51:24.279
And I hope you understand ’round up’ and
’round down’.

02:51:24.279 --> 02:51:27.520
Let’s take a look at a few examples.

02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:30.069
Alright, the first example.

02:51:30.069 --> 02:51:35.819
“There are two point two grams of fat in
this food.”

02:51:35.819 --> 02:51:42.270
“There are two point two grams of fat in
this food.”

02:51:42.270 --> 02:51:45.970
The next example.

02:51:45.970 --> 02:51:53.069
“I got ninety-nine point nine out of one
hundred points on the test.”

02:51:53.069 --> 02:52:02.079
“I got ninety-nine point nine out of one
hundred points on the test.”

02:52:02.079 --> 02:52:03.939
And the last example.

02:52:03.939 --> 02:52:11.040
“My brother is one hundred and fifty point
five centimeters tall.

02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:18.949
“My brother is one hundred and fifty point
five centimeters tall.

02:52:18.949 --> 02:52:25.270
Alright, I hope you have a better understanding
of how to use a decimal point.

02:52:25.270 --> 02:52:32.159
Before we go, I’m going to talk about the
other ‘points’ that we might see in English.

02:52:32.159 --> 02:52:36.339
Now up here, …ahh…we have a point here,
but we don’t say “point”.

02:52:36.339 --> 02:52:37.339
Ok…

02:52:37.339 --> 02:52:39.720
Here, it’s going to be “dot”.

02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:43.390
Ok, we use ‘dot’ for the internet.

02:52:43.390 --> 02:52:44.390
Ok…

02:52:44.390 --> 02:52:49.909
So, if your using e-mail it’s “dot com”.

02:52:49.909 --> 02:52:54.380
Or…”W-w-w dot gogoteacher dot com.”

02:52:54.380 --> 02:52:57.770
Ok, so on the internet, we always say “dot”.

02:52:57.770 --> 02:53:03.989
So, “robin at gogoteacher dot com.”

02:53:03.989 --> 02:53:07.449
Now here is a sentence and we have another
point.

02:53:07.449 --> 02:53:08.449
Ok…

02:53:08.449 --> 02:53:12.199
In the sentence, this is called a “period”.

02:53:12.199 --> 02:53:13.310
Ok…

02:53:13.310 --> 02:53:14.479
This is a ‘dot’.

02:53:14.479 --> 02:53:15.659
This is a ‘period’.

02:53:15.659 --> 02:53:19.890
Ok, so we call that a “period”.

02:53:19.890 --> 02:53:20.989
And looking at money…

02:53:20.989 --> 02:53:24.079
Ok, we’re going to study money in another
video.

02:53:24.079 --> 02:53:31.000
But quickly, if we were reading this money,
we wouldn’t say “dot” and we wouldn’t

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:32.319
say “point”.

02:53:32.319 --> 02:53:37.619
Actually, in money, we say, “One dollar
‘and’ twenty-one cents.”

02:53:37.619 --> 02:53:44.089
So, in money, don’t say, “One point twenty-one
dollars.”

02:53:44.089 --> 02:53:45.089
Very strange.

02:53:45.089 --> 02:53:50.270
This is “One dollar ‘and’ twenty-one
cents.”

02:53:50.270 --> 02:54:01.430
Alright and also, you know, in Korean you
say jeom, but in English, this point is called

02:54:01.430 --> 02:54:02.789
a “mole”.

02:54:02.789 --> 02:54:03.789
Ok…

02:54:03.789 --> 02:54:10.050
So you have, ‘dot’, ‘period’, ‘and’,
‘mole’.

02:54:10.050 --> 02:54:11.909
They all have different names.

02:54:11.909 --> 02:54:12.999
Ahh…be careful.

02:54:12.999 --> 02:54:14.800
Don’t say the wrong name.

02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:17.550
Alright, I hope this video helps you.

02:54:17.550 --> 02:54:21.220
See you next time.

02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:31.770
Ok, in this video, we are going to talk about
how to express percentages in English.

02:54:31.770 --> 02:54:34.939
And I’m going to tell you, it is very very
easy.

02:54:34.939 --> 02:54:37.689
So, this is going to be a short video.

02:54:37.689 --> 02:54:39.359
Let’s take a look.

02:54:39.359 --> 02:54:43.589
Ok, so here are some example numbers.

02:54:43.589 --> 02:54:46.580
And this is called the ‘percent’ sign.

02:54:46.580 --> 02:54:51.560
Ok, so that’s called the ‘percent’ sign.

02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:55.850
And we read the first number as “one percent”.

02:54:55.850 --> 02:54:57.749
Ok, very easy.

02:54:57.749 --> 02:54:59.289
“One percent.”

02:54:59.289 --> 02:55:01.159
The next number.

02:55:01.159 --> 02:55:03.729
“One hundred percent.”

02:55:03.729 --> 02:55:05.939
“One hundred percent.”

02:55:05.939 --> 02:55:08.989
Let’s put a decimal point there.

02:55:08.989 --> 02:55:13.069
So, this is “one point one percent”.

02:55:13.069 --> 02:55:15.589
“One point one percent.”

02:55:15.589 --> 02:55:18.229
The next number.

02:55:18.229 --> 02:55:21.290
“One hundred and one percent.”

02:55:21.290 --> 02:55:22.439
Ok…

02:55:22.439 --> 02:55:26.000
And the last example.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:34.930
“Sixty percent of twelve is equal to seven
point four four.”

02:55:34.930 --> 02:55:40.430
“Sixty percent of twelve is equal…

02:55:40.430 --> 02:55:42.640
seven point four four.”

02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:45.979
Alright, so that’s how you express ‘percent’.

02:55:45.979 --> 02:55:49.489
Let’s look at a few example sentences.

02:55:49.489 --> 02:55:52.470
Alright, the first example…

02:55:52.470 --> 02:55:56.770
“I got sixty-five percent on my test.”

02:55:56.770 --> 02:56:02.370
“I got sixty-five percent on my test.”

02:56:02.370 --> 02:56:06.329
The next example.

02:56:06.329 --> 02:56:10.600
“I lost two percent of my body fat.”

02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:16.640
“I lost two percent of my body fat.”

02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:20.159
And the last example.

02:56:20.159 --> 02:56:23.930
“I agree one hundred percent.”

02:56:23.930 --> 02:56:28.629
“I agree one hundred percent.”

02:56:28.629 --> 02:56:33.510
Ok, so you saw some example of how to use
‘percent’.

02:56:33.510 --> 02:56:37.789
I’m sure you’re already a master on how
to use ‘percent’.

02:56:37.789 --> 02:56:39.100
It’s very easy.

02:56:39.100 --> 02:56:45.880
Ahh…until next video, ….see you.

02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:49.510
Hello, everyone.

02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:54.979
In this video, we are going to talk about
expressing American money.

02:56:54.979 --> 02:56:55.979
Ok…

02:56:55.979 --> 02:57:01.359
So if you travel to America, or other countries,
uhh…you need to know how to express American

02:57:01.359 --> 02:57:05.169
money or dollars or cents.

02:57:05.169 --> 02:57:06.169
Ok…

02:57:06.169 --> 02:57:09.339
Now, let’s take a look at the kinds of money
they have.

02:57:09.339 --> 02:57:12.279
They have, of course, coins and bills.

02:57:12.279 --> 02:57:14.369
Ahh…first, let’s talk about the coins.

02:57:14.369 --> 02:57:17.189
Now, they have four coins.

02:57:17.189 --> 02:57:18.189
Alright…

02:57:18.189 --> 02:57:20.709
And this is how much the coins are worth.

02:57:20.709 --> 02:57:25.350
So, let’s talk about how to express this
in English, first.

02:57:25.350 --> 02:57:28.529
So, how much is this?

02:57:28.529 --> 02:57:29.529
And how much is this?

02:57:29.529 --> 02:57:33.159
Well, this and this…they’re the same amount.

02:57:33.159 --> 02:57:37.890
Ok, this is ‘one cent’…and this is also
‘one cent’.

02:57:37.890 --> 02:57:38.890
Ok…

02:57:38.890 --> 02:57:42.050
That’s the smallest amount of American money.

02:57:42.050 --> 02:57:43.419
‘One cent’.

02:57:43.419 --> 02:57:47.499
Alright, so their ‘coin’, they have a
‘one cent’ coin.

02:57:47.499 --> 02:57:51.350
And the one cent coin is called a ‘penny’.

02:57:51.350 --> 02:57:52.350
Ok…

02:57:52.350 --> 02:57:54.669
The one cent coin.. a ‘penny’.

02:57:54.669 --> 02:57:55.939
Let’s move on.

02:57:55.939 --> 02:57:57.640
This is ‘five cents’.

02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:00.609
Again, this and this…same amount of money.

02:58:00.609 --> 02:58:01.699
‘Five cents’.

02:58:01.699 --> 02:58:02.789
‘Five cents’.

02:58:02.789 --> 02:58:03.879
‘Five cents’.

02:58:03.879 --> 02:58:06.140
They have a five cent coin.

02:58:06.140 --> 02:58:09.930
The five cent coin is called a ‘nickel’.

02:58:09.930 --> 02:58:12.029
A nickel.

02:58:12.029 --> 02:58:13.089
Ok…

02:58:13.089 --> 02:58:14.359
The next coin.

02:58:14.359 --> 02:58:15.359
This is ‘ten cents’.

02:58:15.359 --> 02:58:16.359
Again, ‘ten cents’.

02:58:16.359 --> 02:58:17.359
‘Ten cents’.

02:58:17.359 --> 02:58:18.890
We can write it both ways.

02:58:18.890 --> 02:58:20.879
They have a ten cent coin.

02:58:20.879 --> 02:58:24.050
It’s called a ‘dime’.

02:58:24.050 --> 02:58:26.089
A dime.

02:58:26.089 --> 02:58:27.109
Alright…

02:58:27.109 --> 02:58:29.159
And the last coin is ‘twenty-five cents’.

02:58:29.159 --> 02:58:30.159
‘Twenty-five cents’.

02:58:30.159 --> 02:58:32.659
‘Twenty-five cents’.

02:58:32.659 --> 02:58:36.720
And they call the twenty-five cent coin a
‘quarter’.

02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:39.220
A quarter.

02:58:39.220 --> 02:58:40.460
Alright…

02:58:40.460 --> 02:58:46.499
Now, to get to one dollar, you need one hundred
cents.

02:58:46.499 --> 02:58:50.829
Ok, one hundred cents makes one dollar.

02:58:50.829 --> 02:58:56.890
So if you have four quarters, you have one
dollar.

02:58:56.890 --> 02:59:02.430
If you have ten dimes, that’s the same as
a dollar.

02:59:02.430 --> 02:59:07.409
If you have twenty nickels, that’s the same
as a dollar.

02:59:07.409 --> 02:59:10.649
And how many…how many one cent pennies do
you need?

02:59:10.649 --> 02:59:11.760
How many pennies?

02:59:11.760 --> 02:59:15.880
Well, you need one hundred pennies to make
a dollar.

02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:16.880
Ok…

02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:18.700
Let’s move on to the bills.

02:59:18.700 --> 02:59:23.090
Ok, so they use six main bills.

02:59:23.090 --> 02:59:24.090
Ok…

02:59:24.090 --> 02:59:25.279
The one dollar bill.

02:59:25.279 --> 02:59:27.520
The five dollar bill.

02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:29.189
The ten dollar bill.

02:59:29.189 --> 02:59:30.890
The twenty dollar bill.

02:59:30.890 --> 02:59:33.149
The fifty dollar bill.

02:59:33.149 --> 02:59:34.899
and the one hundred dollar bill.

02:59:34.899 --> 02:59:37.569
Again, the bills, that’s the paper money.

02:59:37.569 --> 02:59:39.840
They have six main ones.

02:59:39.840 --> 02:59:43.840
Alright, so that is the coins, that is the
bills.

02:59:43.840 --> 02:59:47.869
Let’s do some practice on how to express
the money.

02:59:47.869 --> 02:59:52.840
Ok, so to express American money let’s look
at these numbers, first.

02:59:52.840 --> 02:59:55.859
Ok, we’ll start off easy.

02:59:55.859 --> 02:59:58.939
Now, of course, this is “one dollar”.

02:59:58.939 --> 03:00:00.329
“One dollar”.

03:00:00.329 --> 03:00:02.210
And we should use “dollar”.

03:00:02.210 --> 03:00:03.609
“One dollar”.

03:00:03.609 --> 03:00:06.560
But let’s move on to ‘ten’.

03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:08.649
“Ten dollars”.

03:00:08.649 --> 03:00:10.749
“Ten dollars”.

03:00:10.749 --> 03:00:12.699
You can hear this ‘s’ now.

03:00:12.699 --> 03:00:16.260
Ok, you have to be very careful with the plural
‘s’.

03:00:16.260 --> 03:00:18.130
It’s very important.

03:00:18.130 --> 03:00:20.890
So, we have “one dollar.”

03:00:20.890 --> 03:00:23.390
But, “two dollars.”

03:00:23.390 --> 03:00:25.050
“Three dollars.”

03:00:25.050 --> 03:00:26.709
“Ten dollars.”

03:00:26.709 --> 03:00:30.560
Ok, make sure you have the ‘s’.

03:00:30.560 --> 03:00:32.569
It’s so important.

03:00:32.569 --> 03:00:33.609
Alright…

03:00:33.609 --> 03:00:35.779
Never say “ten dollar.”

03:00:35.779 --> 03:00:39.149
Ok, that sounds very strange and stupid.

03:00:39.149 --> 03:00:41.680
Ok, it’s “ten dollars.”

03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:42.949
“Ten dollars.”

03:00:42.949 --> 03:00:45.189
make sure you have that ‘s’.

03:00:45.189 --> 03:00:47.839
So, “Ten dollars.”

03:00:47.839 --> 03:00:50.529
“One hundred dollars.”

03:00:50.529 --> 03:00:54.289
“One thousand dollars.”

03:00:54.289 --> 03:00:57.620
“Ten thousand dollars.”

03:00:57.620 --> 03:01:01.579
“One hundred thousand dollars.”

03:01:01.579 --> 03:01:05.810
“One million dollars.”

03:01:05.810 --> 03:01:06.930
So one more time.

03:01:06.930 --> 03:01:08.399
“One dollar.”

03:01:08.399 --> 03:01:09.880
“Ten dollars.”

03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:11.579
“One hundred dollars.”

03:01:11.579 --> 03:01:14.149
“One thousand dollars.”

03:01:14.149 --> 03:01:16.279
“Ten thousand dollars.”

03:01:16.279 --> 03:01:18.449
“One hundred thousand dollars.”

03:01:18.449 --> 03:01:20.939
“One million dollars.”

03:01:20.939 --> 03:01:21.939
Ok…

03:01:21.939 --> 03:01:26.649
Let’s move on to some more difficult use
of American money.

03:01:26.649 --> 03:01:30.449
Alright, so these examples are a little more
difficult.

03:01:30.449 --> 03:01:35.210
But it helps us understand how to express
American money.

03:01:35.210 --> 03:01:37.539
Alright, let’s look at the first number.

03:01:37.539 --> 03:01:41.279
Of course, this is “six dollars”.

03:01:41.279 --> 03:01:43.250
“Six dollars.”

03:01:43.250 --> 03:01:45.319
And the second one is the same.

03:01:45.319 --> 03:01:46.319
Ok…

03:01:46.319 --> 03:01:47.370
Don’t be confused by this.

03:01:47.370 --> 03:01:53.779
This is six dol…actually this means “six
dollars…” and there’s no cents.

03:01:53.779 --> 03:01:58.629
So, you could write ‘six dollars’ like
this or you could write ‘six dollars’

03:01:58.629 --> 03:01:59.629
like this.

03:01:59.629 --> 03:02:00.699
It means the same.

03:02:00.699 --> 03:02:01.699
Alright…

03:02:01.699 --> 03:02:02.840
Let’s move on.

03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:04.779
Now we have ‘cents’.

03:02:04.779 --> 03:02:07.539
Now, it gets difficult.

03:02:07.539 --> 03:02:08.539
Listen carefully.

03:02:08.539 --> 03:02:18.250
So, I’m going to read this number as “six
dollars and thirty-one cents”.

03:02:18.250 --> 03:02:19.250
Ok…

03:02:19.250 --> 03:02:20.250
Don’t say “point”.

03:02:20.250 --> 03:02:21.409
Don’t say “dot”.

03:02:21.409 --> 03:02:24.739
We’re going to use “and”.

03:02:24.739 --> 03:02:28.659
“Six dollars and thirty-one cents.”

03:02:28.659 --> 03:02:29.659
Alright…

03:02:29.659 --> 03:02:34.689
Now, there’s another way to express this
money.

03:02:34.689 --> 03:02:36.229
A quicker way.

03:02:36.229 --> 03:02:40.050
So, as I said, “six dollars and thirty-one
cents”.

03:02:40.050 --> 03:02:46.939
But the quicker way..uhh..an American might
say, just…”six thirty-one”.

03:02:46.939 --> 03:02:49.359
“How much is it?”

03:02:49.359 --> 03:02:51.229
“Six thirty-one.”

03:02:51.229 --> 03:02:52.229
Ok…

03:02:52.229 --> 03:02:53.229
So you got to be careful.

03:02:53.229 --> 03:02:54.229
There’s actually two ways.

03:02:54.229 --> 03:02:56.430
“Six dollars and thirty-one cents.”

03:02:56.430 --> 03:02:59.350
Or the quick way:
“Six thirty-one.”

03:02:59.350 --> 03:03:02.080
Alright, let’s look at the next one.

03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:03.379
“How much is it?”

03:03:03.379 --> 03:03:11.260
“Nine dollars and ninety-nine cents.”

03:03:11.260 --> 03:03:15.739
And, of course, the quick way:
“Nine ninety-nine.”

03:03:15.739 --> 03:03:17.649
“Nine ninety-nine.”

03:03:17.649 --> 03:03:21.159
Alright, let’s move on.

03:03:21.159 --> 03:03:25.739
“Twenty-two dollars and fifty cents.”

03:03:25.739 --> 03:03:30.029
“Twenty-two dollars and fifty cents.”

03:03:30.029 --> 03:03:33.949
And the quick way:
“Twenty-two fifty.”

03:03:33.949 --> 03:03:36.359
“Twenty-two fifty.”

03:03:36.359 --> 03:03:38.930
Alright…bigger number here.

03:03:38.930 --> 03:03:44.300
“One hundred and seventeen dollars and thirty-two
cents.”

03:03:44.300 --> 03:03:50.159
“One hundred and seventeen dollars and thirty-two
cents.”

03:03:50.159 --> 03:03:55.130
Or the quick way:
“One seventeen thirty-two.”

03:03:55.130 --> 03:04:00.319
Alright, and the last amount…very big number.

03:04:00.319 --> 03:04:03.270
There’s no quick way for this number.

03:04:03.270 --> 03:04:05.699
Alright, it’s a lot of money.

03:04:05.699 --> 03:04:16.459
“One million two hundred and thirty thousand
six hundred and eighty seven dollars and sixteen

03:04:16.459 --> 03:04:17.579
cents.”

03:04:17.579 --> 03:04:28.550
“One million two hundred and thirty thousand
six hundred and eighty seven dollars and sixteen

03:04:28.550 --> 03:04:29.550
cents.”

03:04:29.550 --> 03:04:30.550
Ok…

03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:33.430
That’s how we express American money.

03:04:33.430 --> 03:04:36.050
Let’s see how you will do on the test.

03:04:36.050 --> 03:04:39.130
Ok, so we’re going to d…we’re going
to try a quick test.

03:04:39.130 --> 03:04:41.310
Take out a pen and paper.

03:04:41.310 --> 03:04:46.609
And I’m going to say American money and
you should write down what you hear.

03:04:46.609 --> 03:04:50.199
Alright, question number one.

03:04:50.199 --> 03:04:52.850
“Seven dollars.”

03:04:52.850 --> 03:04:55.489
“Seven dollars.”

03:04:55.489 --> 03:04:58.430
Ok, should look like this.

03:04:58.430 --> 03:05:00.189
Question two.

03:05:00.189 --> 03:05:03.960
“One hundred and twenty dollars.”

03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:07.919
“One hundred and twenty dollars.”

03:05:07.919 --> 03:05:11.470
Ok, looks like this.

03:05:11.470 --> 03:05:13.420
Question three.

03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:17.319
“Seventy-five thousand dollars.”

03:05:17.319 --> 03:05:20.850
“Seventy-five thousand dollars.”

03:05:20.850 --> 03:05:23.250
Ok, like this.

03:05:23.250 --> 03:05:25.800
Question four.

03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:31.919
“One hundred and thirty-four thousand three
hundred dollars.”

03:05:31.919 --> 03:05:38.649
“One hundred and thirty-four thousand three
hundred dollars.”

03:05:38.649 --> 03:05:41.359
Should look like this.

03:05:41.359 --> 03:05:43.159
Question five.

03:05:43.159 --> 03:05:47.479
“One million nine hundred thousand dollars.”

03:05:47.479 --> 03:05:53.829
“One million nine hundred thousand dollars.”

03:05:53.829 --> 03:05:57.260
Question six.

03:05:57.260 --> 03:05:59.550
“Thirty-four cents.”

03:05:59.550 --> 03:06:03.840
“Thirty-four cents.”

03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:07.720
Ok, looks like this.

03:06:07.720 --> 03:06:12.029
Question seven.

03:06:12.029 --> 03:06:16.829
“Twenty-three dollars sixty-seven cents.”

03:06:16.829 --> 03:06:19.470
“Twenty-three dollars sixty-seven cents.”

03:06:19.470 --> 03:06:24.579
Ok, looks like this.

03:06:24.579 --> 03:06:25.810
Question eight.

03:06:25.810 --> 03:06:30.149
“Five hundred and forty-seven dollars fifty
cents.”

03:06:30.149 --> 03:06:35.669
“Five hundred and forty-seven dollars fifty
cents.”

03:06:35.669 --> 03:06:40.420
Ok, like this.

03:06:40.420 --> 03:06:41.420
Question nine.

03:06:41.420 --> 03:06:45.180
“Twelve thousand eight hundred dollars and
thirty-four cents.”

03:06:45.180 --> 03:06:51.979
“Twelve thousand eight hundred dollars and
thirty-four cents.”

03:06:51.979 --> 03:06:56.100
Ok, looks like this.

03:06:56.100 --> 03:06:57.619
Question ten.

03:06:57.619 --> 03:07:04.350
“One million one hundred eleven thousand
one hundred eleven dollars and eleven cents.”

03:07:04.350 --> 03:07:13.819
“One million one hundred eleven thousand
one hundred eleven dollars and eleven cents.”

03:07:13.819 --> 03:07:15.949
Wow, big number.

03:07:15.949 --> 03:07:18.279
Very difficult.

03:07:18.279 --> 03:07:23.760
How did you do on the test?

03:07:23.760 --> 03:07:24.999
I hope you did well.

03:07:24.999 --> 03:07:30.000
I know it’s difficult to listen to American
money, but you must know it.

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:31.000
Ok…

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:35.000
It’s very important to hear the right amount
of money.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:36.000
Alright…

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:37.560
We have this question, again.

03:07:37.560 --> 03:07:42.169
Ok, we did this with the Korean money and
how to express it in Korean money.

03:07:42.169 --> 03:07:46.100
We’re going to do it again, but we’re
going to express in American money.

03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:47.100
Ok…

03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:48.489
So, “How much is it?”

03:07:48.489 --> 03:07:50.310
And, “It’s about…”

03:07:50.310 --> 03:07:53.779
What’s the American money price?

03:07:53.779 --> 03:07:54.779
Same items.

03:07:54.779 --> 03:07:55.779
Let’s look at the pen.

03:07:55.779 --> 03:07:57.850
“How much is a pen?”

03:07:57.850 --> 03:08:01.050
“Well, a pen is about a dollar.”

03:08:01.050 --> 03:08:02.050
Ok…

03:08:02.050 --> 03:08:04.709
So, “It’s about a dollar.”

03:08:04.709 --> 03:08:09.760
And the second one, soju, again, I’m going
into Family Mart…I buy the bottle of soju.

03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:11.289
“How much is it?”

03:08:11.289 --> 03:08:16.510
“Well, it’s about one dollar and twenty-five
cents.”

03:08:16.510 --> 03:08:20.310
“It’s about one dollar and twenty-five
cents.”

03:08:20.310 --> 03:08:21.449
Or…

03:08:21.449 --> 03:08:23.869
“It’s about one twenty-five.”

03:08:23.869 --> 03:08:28.390
Ok, the Galaxy Note.

03:08:28.390 --> 03:08:31.029
Ya, very expensive mobile phone.

03:08:31.029 --> 03:08:32.590
“How much is it?”

03:08:32.590 --> 03:08:36.459
“Well, it’s about eight hundred to nine
hundred dollars.”

03:08:36.459 --> 03:08:41.739
Ok, “It’s about eight hundred or nine
hundred dollars.”

03:08:41.739 --> 03:08:42.739
The KIA Morning.

03:08:42.739 --> 03:08:43.739
The car.

03:08:43.739 --> 03:08:45.109
“How much is it?”

03:08:45.109 --> 03:08:48.600
“Well, it’s about fourteen thousand dollars.”

03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:52.749
“It’s about fourteen thousand dollars.”

03:08:52.749 --> 03:08:55.039
And the Kangnam apartment…

03:08:55.039 --> 03:08:56.550
“How much is it?”

03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:58.279
Ok, very expensive.

03:08:58.279 --> 03:09:00.659
The Kangnam apartment..

03:09:00.659 --> 03:09:02.800
maybe that’s around “a million dollars”.

03:09:02.800 --> 03:09:04.699
Ok, very expensive.

03:09:04.699 --> 03:09:05.699
A lot of money.

03:09:05.699 --> 03:09:08.129
“It’s about a million dollars.”

03:09:08.129 --> 03:09:09.129
Alright…

03:09:09.129 --> 03:09:15.499
I hope you have a good understanding of American
Money and how to express it in English.

03:09:15.499 --> 03:09:19.850
Uhh…be careful not to make a mistake with
American money.

03:09:19.850 --> 03:09:22.460
You don’t want to make anyone angry.

03:09:22.460 --> 03:09:23.460
Alright…

03:09:23.460 --> 03:09:25.489
That’s it for this video.

03:09:25.489 --> 03:09:28.689
See you next time.

03:09:28.689 --> 03:09:34.129
Hello, everyone.

03:09:34.129 --> 03:09:38.379
In this video, we’re going to talk about
basic calendar expression.

03:09:38.379 --> 03:09:40.689
Ok, so it’s a very easy video.

03:09:40.689 --> 03:09:45.659
You probably already know a lot of these expressions.

03:09:45.659 --> 03:09:48.430
Of course, this is a calendar.

03:09:48.430 --> 03:09:51.739
Ok, and we need to know the expressions about
the calendar.

03:09:51.739 --> 03:09:55.359
So, one the board I have the main ones here.

03:09:55.359 --> 03:09:59.159
So the first one, of course, is ‘one day’.

03:09:59.159 --> 03:10:03.109
And we…instead of ‘one day’, we could
just say “a; a day”.

03:10:03.109 --> 03:10:07.039
So on your calendar that is just one day;
a day.

03:10:07.039 --> 03:10:11.739
Next, we have seven days…makes a week.

03:10:11.739 --> 03:10:14.029
Ok, so ‘one week’.

03:10:14.029 --> 03:10:17.180
And, of course, “a month”.

03:10:17.180 --> 03:10:18.180
Ok…

03:10:18.180 --> 03:10:20.699
So ‘a month’ a little bit difficult to
pronounce.

03:10:20.699 --> 03:10:22.060
“A month.”

03:10:22.060 --> 03:10:23.430
“A month.”

03:10:23.430 --> 03:10:25.529
Your tongue has to come out a little bit.

03:10:25.529 --> 03:10:26.529
“A month.”

03:10:26.529 --> 03:10:27.529
“A month.”

03:10:27.529 --> 03:10:30.669
So, ‘a day’, ‘a week’, ‘a month’.

03:10:30.669 --> 03:10:36.069
And, of course, the full calendar…twelve
months…that is ‘a year’.

03:10:36.069 --> 03:10:37.069
Ok…

03:10:37.069 --> 03:10:40.930
So, ‘a day’, ‘a week’, ‘a month’
and ‘a year’.

03:10:40.930 --> 03:10:42.279
Those are the easy ones.

03:10:42.279 --> 03:10:45.189
Let’s get on to bigger…bigger time.

03:10:45.189 --> 03:10:48.840
The next one here is ‘a decade’.

03:10:48.840 --> 03:10:50.669
Ok, what is ‘a decade’?

03:10:50.669 --> 03:10:54.420
Well, ‘a decade’ is ten years.

03:10:54.420 --> 03:10:55.420
Ok…

03:10:55.420 --> 03:11:00.020
Ten years is a decade, so you might buy a
car every decade.

03:11:00.020 --> 03:11:02.220
Ok, every ten years.

03:11:02.220 --> 03:11:06.129
After ‘a decade’, we have ‘a century’.

03:11:06.129 --> 03:11:09.930
‘A century’ is one hundred years.

03:11:09.930 --> 03:11:10.930
Ok…

03:11:10.930 --> 03:11:14.949
And, of course, we live in the twenty-first
century.

03:11:14.949 --> 03:11:22.359
And ‘a century’, we have ‘a millennium’.
uhhh…very difficult to spell.

03:11:22.359 --> 03:11:23.649
“A millennium.”

03:11:23.649 --> 03:11:27.930
‘A millennium’ is one thousand years.

03:11:27.930 --> 03:11:29.739
Ok…very long time.

03:11:29.739 --> 03:11:32.649
One thousand years, we would call ‘a millennium’.

03:11:32.649 --> 03:11:38.319
Ok, after ‘a millennium’ we have something
called ‘an eon’.

03:11:38.319 --> 03:11:42.720
Ok, so notice we’re starting with ‘e’,
so we have to use ‘an’.

03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:44.489
‘An eon’.

03:11:44.489 --> 03:11:46.390
How long is ‘an eon’?

03:11:46.390 --> 03:11:50.189
Well, there is no exact time of ‘an eon’.

03:11:50.189 --> 03:11:54.510
‘An eon’ just means a very very long time.

03:11:54.510 --> 03:11:55.550
Ok…

03:11:55.550 --> 03:12:02.770
So.. example…the dinosaurs…they lived
on the planet eons ago.

03:12:02.770 --> 03:12:05.729
Ok, so it just means a very very long time.

03:12:05.729 --> 03:12:07.300
So this is not exact.

03:12:07.300 --> 03:12:08.300
Ok…

03:12:08.300 --> 03:12:16.399
So, probably, of course, the first are the
easiest and they’re the most important.

03:12:16.399 --> 03:12:20.659
The ‘decade’, ‘century’, ‘millennium’
and ‘eon’, ok, you’re not going to hear

03:12:20.659 --> 03:12:21.659
those too much.

03:12:21.659 --> 03:12:24.699
Ok, just I’m teaching them so you know.

03:12:24.699 --> 03:12:26.850
But you should know the first four.

03:12:26.850 --> 03:12:27.850
Ok…

03:12:27.850 --> 03:12:29.910
So, let’s take a look at a few examples.

03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:32.510
Ok, here are a few examples.

03:12:32.510 --> 03:12:33.739
The first one.

03:12:33.739 --> 03:12:37.989
“There are twenty-four hours in a day.”

03:12:37.989 --> 03:12:43.560
“There are twenty-four hours in a day.”

03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:44.560
Next example…

03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:47.390
“There are seven days in a week.”

03:12:47.390 --> 03:12:51.910
“There are seven days in a week.”

03:12:51.910 --> 03:12:55.869
The next example…

03:12:55.869 --> 03:13:00.109
“There are about four weeks in a month.”

03:13:00.109 --> 03:13:04.039
“There are about four weeks in a month.”

03:13:04.039 --> 03:13:07.710
Ok, the next one.

03:13:07.710 --> 03:13:11.760
“There are three hundred and sixty-five
days in a year.”

03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:17.419
“There are three hundred and sixty-five
days in a year.”

03:13:17.419 --> 03:13:21.189
Alright, the next one.

03:13:21.189 --> 03:13:24.659
“There are ten years in a decade.”

03:13:24.659 --> 03:13:29.029
“There are ten years in a decade.”

03:13:29.029 --> 03:13:31.699
And the next one.

03:13:31.699 --> 03:13:34.600
“There are one hundred years in a century.”

03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:41.100
“There are one hundred years in a century.”

03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:42.359
And the last one.

03:13:42.359 --> 03:13:46.189
“There are one thousand years in a millennium.”

03:13:46.189 --> 03:13:51.459
“There are one thousand years in a millennium.”

03:13:51.459 --> 03:13:56.949
Ok, so I hope you have a better understanding
from the examples.

03:13:56.949 --> 03:14:01.089
So, ‘a day’, ‘a week’, ‘a month’,
‘a year’.

03:14:01.089 --> 03:14:04.949
Those four are the most important for the
calendar.

03:14:04.949 --> 03:14:07.720
And then the last…the last group here.

03:14:07.720 --> 03:14:08.720
Not so common.

03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:11.800
‘A decade’, ‘a century’, you should
know.

03:14:11.800 --> 03:14:16.470
‘Millennium’ and of course ‘an eon’…’an
eon’ a very long time.

03:14:16.470 --> 03:14:18.770
Could be millions of years.

03:14:18.770 --> 03:14:20.600
Alright, so I hope you understand.

03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:24.479
That’s it for this video.

03:14:24.479 --> 03:14:29.669
Hello, everyone.

03:14:29.669 --> 03:14:34.049
In this video, we are going to talk about
‘The Days of the Week’.

03:14:34.049 --> 03:14:38.870
Ok, now the days of the week.. you must know…you
must remember them.

03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:44.479
We’re going to talk about the pronunciation,
the spelling and the short form.

03:14:44.479 --> 03:14:45.479
Ok…

03:14:45.479 --> 03:14:47.419
So, let’s get started.

03:14:47.419 --> 03:14:48.419
Here they are.

03:14:48.419 --> 03:14:52.369
Of course, there’s only seven days of the
week to remember.

03:14:52.369 --> 03:14:54.069
The first one here…

03:14:54.069 --> 03:14:55.069
“Monday.”

03:14:55.069 --> 03:14:59.129
Ok, so listen carefully…how I pronounce
it.

03:14:59.129 --> 03:15:00.399
“Monday.”

03:15:00.399 --> 03:15:01.669
“Monday.”

03:15:01.669 --> 03:15:02.919
The next one.

03:15:02.919 --> 03:15:03.919
“Tuesday.”

03:15:03.919 --> 03:15:04.919
“Tuesday.”

03:15:04.919 --> 03:15:09.100
The next one.

03:15:09.100 --> 03:15:11.560
Ok, this one’s a little difficult.

03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:12.560
“Wednesday.”

03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:13.560
“Wednesday.”

03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:16.329
Ok, what’s the problem?

03:15:16.329 --> 03:15:18.319
Now ‘Wednesday’ has a ‘d’.

03:15:18.319 --> 03:15:22.180
But when we say ‘Wednesday’, uhhh…we
don’t say the ‘d’ sound.

03:15:22.180 --> 03:15:23.909
We don’t say “Wed-nes-day”.

03:15:23.909 --> 03:15:25.069
Ok…

03:15:25.069 --> 03:15:27.399
It’s “Wednesday.”

03:15:27.399 --> 03:15:29.629
So this is “Wednesday.”

03:15:29.629 --> 03:15:31.060
“Wednesday.”

03:15:31.060 --> 03:15:32.489
Ok…

03:15:32.489 --> 03:15:34.090
The next one.

03:15:34.090 --> 03:15:35.090
“Thursday.”

03:15:35.090 --> 03:15:36.090
“Thursday.”

03:15:36.090 --> 03:15:40.619
Ok, it has a ‘t-h’.
“th…th..th.”

03:15:40.619 --> 03:15:42.999
Your tongue has to come out.

03:15:42.999 --> 03:15:44.359
“Thursday.”

03:15:44.359 --> 03:15:45.720
“Thursday.”

03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:47.080
“Thursday.”

03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:48.439
Alright…

03:15:48.439 --> 03:15:49.520
Next one.

03:15:49.520 --> 03:15:50.520
“Friday.”

03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:51.520
“Friday.”

03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:54.609
We have an ‘f’.

03:15:54.609 --> 03:15:58.359
“F…F.”
Your teeth should touch your lip.

03:15:58.359 --> 03:15:59.619
“Friday.”

03:15:59.619 --> 03:16:00.890
“Friday.”

03:16:00.890 --> 03:16:02.149
Ok…

03:16:02.149 --> 03:16:03.409
“Saturday.”

03:16:03.409 --> 03:16:04.680
“Saturday.”

03:16:04.680 --> 03:16:06.340
And the last one.

03:16:06.340 --> 03:16:07.549
“Sunday.”

03:16:07.549 --> 03:16:08.760
“Sunday.”

03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:16.010
Ok, let’s do them again…very quick.

03:16:16.010 --> 03:16:17.220
“Monday.”

03:16:17.220 --> 03:16:18.420
“Tuesday.”

03:16:18.420 --> 03:16:19.629
“Wednesday.”

03:16:19.629 --> 03:16:20.839
“Thursday.”

03:16:20.839 --> 03:16:22.049
“Friday.”

03:16:22.049 --> 03:16:23.260
“Saturday.”

03:16:23.260 --> 03:16:24.460
“Sunday.”

03:16:24.460 --> 03:16:25.680
Ok…

03:16:25.680 --> 03:16:27.590
But I hope you can do them really fast.

03:16:27.590 --> 03:16:29.479
Ok, so like “Monday.

03:16:29.479 --> 03:16:30.479
Tuesday.

03:16:30.479 --> 03:16:31.479
Wednesday.

03:16:31.479 --> 03:16:32.479
Thursday.

03:16:32.479 --> 03:16:33.479
Friday.

03:16:33.479 --> 03:16:34.479
Saturday.

03:16:34.479 --> 03:16:35.479
Sunday.”

03:16:35.479 --> 03:16:36.479
Ok…

03:16:36.479 --> 03:16:37.479
You should practice until you can do it that
way.

03:16:37.479 --> 03:16:39.261
Alright, let’s look at the spelling now.

03:16:39.261 --> 03:16:45.499
Now the spelling…ok…now they’re very
difficult to remember how to spell.

03:16:45.499 --> 03:16:49.890
But please, know the correct way of how to
spell.

03:16:49.890 --> 03:16:52.310
So, the first one ‘Monday’.

03:16:52.310 --> 03:16:55.680
Now, the first letter is always big.

03:16:55.680 --> 03:16:57.960
It’s always a ‘capital’ letter.

03:16:57.960 --> 03:16:59.079
The big letter.

03:16:59.079 --> 03:17:00.989
You must always put the capital.

03:17:00.989 --> 03:17:01.989
So, ‘Monday’.

03:17:01.989 --> 03:17:03.170
‘Tuesday’, capital ‘T’.

03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:04.779
Capital ‘W’.

03:17:04.779 --> 03:17:06.310
Capital ‘T’.

03:17:06.310 --> 03:17:07.659
Capital ‘F’…

03:17:07.659 --> 03:17:11.090
And these two have the capital ‘S’.

03:17:11.090 --> 03:17:12.209
The big ‘S’.

03:17:12.209 --> 03:17:13.209
Ok…

03:17:13.209 --> 03:17:16.930
You always have to make that capital.

03:17:16.930 --> 03:17:21.300
And the spelling…yeah, as I said, little
bit difficult to remember.

03:17:21.300 --> 03:17:26.869
Ok, you’d have to do some self-study and
remember how to spell.

03:17:26.869 --> 03:17:28.189
The short form.

03:17:28.189 --> 03:17:29.189
‘Monday’.

03:17:29.189 --> 03:17:34.109
These are the official short form of the days
of the week.

03:17:34.109 --> 03:17:39.879
Again, you need the capital letters.

03:17:39.879 --> 03:17:42.369
And the ‘period’ at the end.

03:17:42.369 --> 03:17:43.369
Ok…

03:17:43.369 --> 03:17:45.569
So, ‘m-o-n’ period.

03:17:45.569 --> 03:17:46.569
“Tuesday.”

03:17:46.569 --> 03:17:47.569
“Wednesday.”

03:17:47.569 --> 03:17:48.569
“Thurs.”

03:17:48.569 --> 03:17:49.569
Ok…

03:17:49.569 --> 03:17:52.090
This is not very short, ok.. but you need
that.

03:17:52.090 --> 03:17:56.140
That’s considered the official short form.

03:17:56.140 --> 03:17:57.229
“Friday.”

03:17:57.229 --> 03:17:58.329
“Saturday.”

03:17:58.329 --> 03:17:59.419
“Sun.”

03:17:59.419 --> 03:18:07.590
Alright, so that’s the pronunciation, spelling
and short form, but before we move on I want

03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:10.949
to talk about one more thing.

03:18:10.949 --> 03:18:12.560
These days of the week…

03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:13.959
‘Monday’ to ‘Friday’.

03:18:13.959 --> 03:18:16.619
Those are called the ‘weekdays’.

03:18:16.619 --> 03:18:17.619
Ok…

03:18:17.619 --> 03:18:18.619
“Monday.”

03:18:18.619 --> 03:18:19.619
“Tuesday.”

03:18:19.619 --> 03:18:20.619
“Wednesday.”

03:18:20.619 --> 03:18:21.619
“Thursday.”

03:18:21.619 --> 03:18:22.619
“Friday.”

03:18:22.619 --> 03:18:23.619
‘Weekdays’.

03:18:23.619 --> 03:18:24.619
Ok, those are the working days.

03:18:24.619 --> 03:18:25.619
The ‘Weekdays’.

03:18:25.619 --> 03:18:28.580
And, of course, ‘Saturday’ and ‘Sunday’…

03:18:28.580 --> 03:18:30.329
That’s the ‘weekend’.

03:18:30.329 --> 03:18:31.329
Ok…

03:18:31.329 --> 03:18:32.510
So, ‘Weekdays’.

03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:33.510
‘Weekend’.

03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:35.420
Remember that, also.

03:18:35.420 --> 03:18:38.749
Ok, let’s move on to a few examples.

03:18:38.749 --> 03:18:44.069
Ok, we’re going to talk about three important
questions…talking about the day.

03:18:44.069 --> 03:18:48.999
And the questions are talking about ‘today’,
‘tomorrow’ and ‘yesterday’.

03:18:48.999 --> 03:18:50.989
Let’s take a look at the questions.

03:18:50.989 --> 03:18:51.989
Ok…

03:18:51.989 --> 03:18:53.669
Now, the first one is very important.

03:18:53.669 --> 03:18:55.420
“What day is today?”

03:18:55.420 --> 03:18:56.699
“What day is today?”

03:18:56.699 --> 03:19:00.029
Now some people, they will say “Which day
is today?”

03:19:00.029 --> 03:19:03.220
Ahh..ok, that’s a little strange.

03:19:03.220 --> 03:19:05.060
More common is using “What”.

03:19:05.060 --> 03:19:07.430
“What day is today?”

03:19:07.430 --> 03:19:09.310
So, your answer “It’s…”.

03:19:09.310 --> 03:19:12.080
Ok, your answer should always begin with “It’s…”.

03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:13.830
“What day is today?”

03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:14.970
“It’s Monday.”

03:19:14.970 --> 03:19:15.970
Ok…

03:19:15.970 --> 03:19:18.109
Now, some people don’t use “It’s”.

03:19:18.109 --> 03:19:20.449
“What day is today?”

03:19:20.449 --> 03:19:21.449
“Monday.”

03:19:21.449 --> 03:19:22.449
Ok…

03:19:22.449 --> 03:19:23.909
That’s ok.

03:19:23.909 --> 03:19:26.549
But, better is using the ‘it’s’.

03:19:26.549 --> 03:19:27.549
“It’s Monday.”

03:19:27.549 --> 03:19:29.329
Ok, that’s grammatically correct.

03:19:29.329 --> 03:19:31.279
That’s a full sentence.

03:19:31.279 --> 03:19:32.279
“It’s Monday.”

03:19:32.279 --> 03:19:33.279
Alright…

03:19:33.279 --> 03:19:35.560
Let’s look at the next one.

03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:37.609
“What day is tomorrow?”

03:19:37.609 --> 03:19:40.939
Ok, so ‘tomorrow’….in the future.

03:19:40.939 --> 03:19:43.449
“What day is tomorrow?”

03:19:43.449 --> 03:19:45.430
Again, “It’s Tuesday.”

03:19:45.430 --> 03:19:48.399
Ok, “What day is tomorrow?”

03:19:48.399 --> 03:19:49.649
“It’s Tuesday.”

03:19:49.649 --> 03:19:57.119
Now, it is also possible.. because it’s
‘future’, we can say, “What day will

03:19:57.119 --> 03:19:58.819
be tomorrow?”.

03:19:58.819 --> 03:20:02.659
“It will be Tuesday.”

03:20:02.659 --> 03:20:03.659
Ok…

03:20:03.659 --> 03:20:05.340
“What day will be tomorrow?”

03:20:05.340 --> 03:20:07.569
“It will be Tuesday.”

03:20:07.569 --> 03:20:11.619
But actually…that’s ok, but this is more
common.

03:20:11.619 --> 03:20:12.779
“What day is tomorrow?”

03:20:12.779 --> 03:20:13.779
It’s easier.

03:20:13.779 --> 03:20:14.779
“What day is tomorrow?”

03:20:14.779 --> 03:20:15.779
“It’s Tuesday.”

03:20:15.779 --> 03:20:16.779
Alright…

03:20:16.779 --> 03:20:19.020
The last one here.

03:20:19.020 --> 03:20:21.299
“What day was yesterday?”

03:20:21.299 --> 03:20:23.419
Ok, ‘yesterday’…in the past.

03:20:23.419 --> 03:20:25.549
“What day was yesterday?”

03:20:25.549 --> 03:20:30.749
Ok, we’re using…we’re changing the ‘be’
verb.. ”is”, “is”, to “was”.

03:20:30.749 --> 03:20:32.689
Past tense.

03:20:32.689 --> 03:20:35.579
“What day was yesterday?”

03:20:35.579 --> 03:20:38.239
“It was Sunday.”

03:20:38.239 --> 03:20:39.279
“It was Sunday.”

03:20:39.279 --> 03:20:40.739
“What day was yesterday?”

03:20:40.739 --> 03:20:41.970
“It was Sunday.”

03:20:41.970 --> 03:20:44.299
Ok, so again, let’s review.

03:20:44.299 --> 03:20:46.029
“What day is today?”

03:20:46.029 --> 03:20:47.149
“It’s Monday.”

03:20:47.149 --> 03:20:49.470
“What day is tomorrow?”

03:20:49.470 --> 03:20:50.930
“It’s Tuesday.”

03:20:50.930 --> 03:20:52.909
“What day was yesterday?”

03:20:52.909 --> 03:20:54.260
“It was Sunday.”

03:20:54.260 --> 03:20:55.260
Ok…

03:20:55.260 --> 03:20:58.999
This is the best way to ask and answer these
questions.

03:20:58.999 --> 03:20:59.999
Alright…

03:20:59.999 --> 03:21:01.270
Let’s move on.

03:21:01.270 --> 03:21:08.659
Ok, we’re going to look at three more questions
talking about how to express days of the week.

03:21:08.659 --> 03:21:12.419
Now, these questions are not talking about
‘what day is today?’

03:21:12.419 --> 03:21:14.829
or ‘tomorrow’ or ‘yesterday’.

03:21:14.829 --> 03:21:17.739
These questions are asking about…uhh…some
event.

03:21:17.739 --> 03:21:22.870
Ok, something is going to happen on a day.

03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:23.870
Ok…

03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:31.239
And when something is going to happen, on
a day, before we say the day, we should always

03:21:31.239 --> 03:21:32.970
use the preposition ‘on’.

03:21:32.970 --> 03:21:37.020
Ok, we need that preposition ‘on’.

03:21:37.020 --> 03:21:38.569
So the first question.

03:21:38.569 --> 03:21:40.560
“When is our date?”

03:21:40.560 --> 03:21:41.939
“When is our meeting?”

03:21:41.939 --> 03:21:44.189
Ok, I have to meet you.

03:21:44.189 --> 03:21:45.729
“When is our date?”

03:21:45.729 --> 03:21:48.439
Ok, and you should answer with ‘on’.

03:21:48.439 --> 03:21:49.800
“On Friday.”

03:21:49.800 --> 03:21:50.800
Ok…

03:21:50.800 --> 03:21:53.939
“We’re going to meet on Friday.”

03:21:53.939 --> 03:21:55.310
You need that preposition.

03:21:55.310 --> 03:21:57.710
This is our event…our meeting.

03:21:57.710 --> 03:21:58.710
When?

03:21:58.710 --> 03:22:01.199
“On Friday.”

03:22:01.199 --> 03:22:02.279
Next question.

03:22:02.279 --> 03:22:05.250
“Which days do we have English class?”

03:22:05.250 --> 03:22:08.839
Ok, “Which days do we have English class?”

03:22:08.839 --> 03:22:10.390
Now, this is asking “days”.

03:22:10.390 --> 03:22:13.800
“Which ‘days’ do we have English class?”

03:22:13.800 --> 03:22:16.270
Well, “On Mondays.”

03:22:16.270 --> 03:22:18.739
Ok, “On Mondays.”

03:22:18.739 --> 03:22:22.020
So, the event is English class.

03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:23.020
When?

03:22:23.020 --> 03:22:24.299
“On Mondays.”

03:22:24.299 --> 03:22:25.779
And the last question.

03:22:25.779 --> 03:22:28.709
“When is my homework due?”

03:22:28.709 --> 03:22:30.270
“When is my homework due?”

03:22:30.270 --> 03:22:32.420
“When do I need to give my homework?”

03:22:32.420 --> 03:22:34.630
That’s the event.

03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:36.100
“On Wednesday.”

03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:38.300
Ok, “On Wednesday.”

03:22:38.300 --> 03:22:44.220
Ok, so when asking questions about ‘what
day is today’, ‘tomorrow’ and ‘yesterday’,

03:22:44.220 --> 03:22:45.220
you use “it’s”.

03:22:45.220 --> 03:22:48.029
But when you’re asking about some event..

03:22:48.029 --> 03:22:54.499
ok.. something is going to happen on a day…you
have to use the preposition ‘on’.

03:22:54.499 --> 03:22:55.499
Alright…

03:22:55.499 --> 03:22:57.129
Let’s move on.

03:22:57.129 --> 03:23:05.010
Ok, we’re at the end of the video, but before
we go, I want to talk about some common spelling

03:23:05.010 --> 03:23:08.119
mistakes that my students do.

03:23:08.119 --> 03:23:09.609
Let’s take a look.

03:23:09.609 --> 03:23:15.399
Ok, so here are some days of the week, but
the spelling is wrong.

03:23:15.399 --> 03:23:17.369
And the first one is ‘Thuesday’.

03:23:17.369 --> 03:23:21.270
Ok, a lot of my students write ‘Thuesday’.

03:23:21.270 --> 03:23:24.380
I don’t know what day ‘Thuesday’ is…uhhh…

03:23:24.380 --> 03:23:30.760
I think they’re confused between ‘Tuesday’
and ‘Thursday’.

03:23:30.760 --> 03:23:34.810
And somehow they’re mixing ‘Tuesday’
and ‘Thursday’ for ‘Thuesday’.

03:23:34.810 --> 03:23:37.569
Ok, don’t write ‘Thuesday’.

03:23:37.569 --> 03:23:40.169
There is never a ‘Thuesday’.

03:23:40.169 --> 03:23:42.489
Be careful.

03:23:42.489 --> 03:23:43.770
Next one.

03:23:43.770 --> 03:23:44.770
“Wednesday.”

03:23:44.770 --> 03:23:49.470
Ok, so ‘Wednesday’ has a ‘d’, in the
spelling there’s a ‘d’.

03:23:49.470 --> 03:23:51.520
But, of course, we don’t say “Wed-nes-day”.

03:23:51.520 --> 03:23:54.010
We say “Wednesday.”

03:23:54.010 --> 03:23:58.829
So lots of students spell it as they hear
it.

03:23:58.829 --> 03:24:00.640
Ok, you got to be careful.

03:24:00.640 --> 03:24:02.220
There is a ‘d’.

03:24:02.220 --> 03:24:05.209
So this ‘Wednesday’, sorry this is wrong.

03:24:05.209 --> 03:24:06.209
No!

03:24:06.209 --> 03:24:07.959
Don’t do this.

03:24:07.959 --> 03:24:09.569
The next one.

03:24:09.569 --> 03:24:10.569
“Saturday.”

03:24:10.569 --> 03:24:12.010
Looks good.

03:24:12.010 --> 03:24:16.470
‘Saturday’, but be careful because this
is a ‘u’, not an ‘e’.

03:24:16.470 --> 03:24:17.470
“Saturday.”

03:24:17.470 --> 03:24:20.810
So, don’t spell it with the ‘e’.

03:24:20.810 --> 03:24:22.069
The last two.

03:24:22.069 --> 03:24:24.109
“Monday” and “Sunday.”

03:24:24.109 --> 03:24:25.109
‘Monday’.

03:24:25.109 --> 03:24:26.140
What’s wrong?

03:24:26.140 --> 03:24:31.379
Well, the spelling is ok, but there’s too
much space here.

03:24:31.379 --> 03:24:32.439
Ok…

03:24:32.439 --> 03:24:36.239
A lot of students separate the ‘day’.

03:24:36.239 --> 03:24:37.239
‘Tues…day’.

03:24:37.239 --> 03:24:38.239
‘Wednes…day’.

03:24:38.239 --> 03:24:40.720
They put too much space.

03:24:40.720 --> 03:24:42.689
Ok, it’s one word.

03:24:42.689 --> 03:24:45.089
It should be very close.

03:24:45.089 --> 03:24:46.089
Be careful.

03:24:46.089 --> 03:24:48.750
Not too much space.

03:24:48.750 --> 03:24:50.470
And the last one, ‘Sunday’.

03:24:50.470 --> 03:24:51.669
What’s wrong?

03:24:51.669 --> 03:24:56.529
Well, as I old you, it always starts with
a capital letter.

03:24:56.529 --> 03:25:00.689
So, if you write it with a small ‘s’,
that’s wrong.

03:25:00.689 --> 03:25:01.689
Ok…

03:25:01.689 --> 03:25:03.089
Alright, so…

03:25:03.089 --> 03:25:05.749
Don’t make these spelling mistakes.

03:25:05.749 --> 03:25:08.619
Ahh..those are the days of the week.

03:25:08.619 --> 03:25:10.560
You have to remember all seven.

03:25:10.560 --> 03:25:13.579
The pronunciation and the spelling.

03:25:13.579 --> 03:25:16.640
Takes some self-study, but I know you can
do it.

03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:17.640
Alright…

03:25:17.640 --> 03:25:19.240
That’s it for this video.

03:25:19.240 --> 03:25:22.449
See you next time.

03:25:22.449 --> 03:25:28.090
Hello, everyone.

03:25:28.090 --> 03:25:32.649
In this video, we are going to talk about
Months of the Year.

03:25:32.649 --> 03:25:38.310
Ok, I know the months of the year are very
difficult to pronounce and spell.

03:25:38.310 --> 03:25:39.549
There’s twelve of them.

03:25:39.549 --> 03:25:42.109
So, also, very difficult to remember.

03:25:42.109 --> 03:25:43.140
Ok…

03:25:43.140 --> 03:25:50.419
In this video, we are going to focus on pronunciation,
spelling and the short form of the month.

03:25:50.419 --> 03:25:53.010
So, let’s take a look at the first one.

03:25:53.010 --> 03:25:54.010
“January.”

03:25:54.010 --> 03:25:55.010
“January.”

03:25:55.010 --> 03:25:58.149
Ok, be sure to pronounce that correctly.

03:25:58.149 --> 03:25:59.149
“January.”

03:25:59.149 --> 03:26:00.149
“January.”

03:26:00.149 --> 03:26:05.360
And for the spelling, remember we need a capital
‘J’.

03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:06.839
A big ‘J’.

03:26:06.839 --> 03:26:09.869
We always need this for each month.

03:26:09.869 --> 03:26:11.020
The capital letter.

03:26:11.020 --> 03:26:13.449
Ok, so “January.”

03:26:13.449 --> 03:26:15.739
And the short form…’Jan.’.

03:26:15.739 --> 03:26:16.939
With a period.

03:26:16.939 --> 03:26:18.329
This is called a period.

03:26:18.329 --> 03:26:20.040
So, ‘Jan.’.

03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:21.220
Capital letter.

03:26:21.220 --> 03:26:22.399
Period.

03:26:22.399 --> 03:26:29.140
The next month is probably the most difficult
month for my students to pronounce and spell.

03:26:29.140 --> 03:26:31.409
Ok, they’re always confused with this.

03:26:31.409 --> 03:26:34.579
Ok, now let’s focus on the ‘F’.

03:26:34.579 --> 03:26:37.010
This is an ‘F’ sound.

03:26:37.010 --> 03:26:38.010
“fff.”

03:26:38.010 --> 03:26:40.369
Your teeth should touch your lip.

03:26:40.369 --> 03:26:41.369
“fff.”

03:26:41.369 --> 03:26:43.729
And this is a ‘b’ sound.

03:26:43.729 --> 03:26:44.729
“bbb.”

03:26:44.729 --> 03:26:45.729
Ok…

03:26:45.729 --> 03:26:54.260
So we should think of this as “Fe…”,
“Fe…”, “bru…”, “bru…”, “ary…”.

03:26:54.260 --> 03:26:55.490
“Fe..bru..ary.”

03:26:55.490 --> 03:26:56.709
“Fe..bru..ary.”

03:26:56.709 --> 03:26:57.939
“February.”

03:26:57.939 --> 03:26:59.159
“February.”

03:26:59.159 --> 03:27:00.390
“February.”

03:27:00.390 --> 03:27:04.029
Ok, it’s very difficult.

03:27:04.029 --> 03:27:05.029
“February.”

03:27:05.029 --> 03:27:06.029
“February.”

03:27:06.029 --> 03:27:09.899
So, it takes a lot of practice…

03:27:09.899 --> 03:27:11.589
Also, the spelling…

03:27:11.589 --> 03:27:17.529
Ok, my students are often confused with the
spelling and the ‘R’s’.

03:27:17.529 --> 03:27:19.010
“February.”

03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:20.449
And the short form…

03:27:20.449 --> 03:27:22.590
‘F-e-b’ period.

03:27:22.590 --> 03:27:26.479
The next four…little bit easier.

03:27:26.479 --> 03:27:28.369
Ok…

03:27:28.369 --> 03:27:30.260
“March.”

03:27:30.260 --> 03:27:32.149
“March.”

03:27:32.149 --> 03:27:34.029
“April.”

03:27:34.029 --> 03:27:35.919
“April.”

03:27:35.919 --> 03:27:37.810
“May.”

03:27:37.810 --> 03:27:39.699
“May.”

03:27:39.699 --> 03:27:41.149
And “June.”

03:27:41.149 --> 03:27:42.529
“June.”

03:27:42.529 --> 03:27:43.909
Ok…

03:27:43.909 --> 03:27:45.310
And the short form.

03:27:45.310 --> 03:27:47.260
Capital, remember the capital.

03:27:47.260 --> 03:27:48.729
‘M-a-r’ period.

03:27:48.729 --> 03:27:50.189
‘A-p-r’ period.

03:27:50.189 --> 03:27:51.760
‘May’ is special.

03:27:51.760 --> 03:27:53.380
There is no short form.

03:27:53.380 --> 03:27:56.109
‘May’ is just always ‘May’.

03:27:56.109 --> 03:27:58.689
So you should never have a ‘period’ here.

03:27:58.689 --> 03:28:00.319
Never have the same.

03:28:00.319 --> 03:28:01.430
“May.”

03:28:01.430 --> 03:28:02.459
Only ‘May’.

03:28:02.459 --> 03:28:03.459
“June.”

03:28:03.459 --> 03:28:04.800
‘J-u-n’ period.

03:28:04.800 --> 03:28:08.689
Ok, so the first six…one more time.

03:28:08.689 --> 03:28:09.829
“January.”

03:28:09.829 --> 03:28:10.970
“February.”

03:28:10.970 --> 03:28:12.109
“March.”

03:28:12.109 --> 03:28:13.249
“April.”

03:28:13.249 --> 03:28:14.390
“May.”

03:28:14.390 --> 03:28:15.529
“June.”

03:28:15.529 --> 03:28:23.640
Ok, let’s take a look at the last six months
starting with “July”.

03:28:23.640 --> 03:28:24.640
Ok…

03:28:24.640 --> 03:28:28.049
So, don’t be confused with ‘June’.

03:28:28.049 --> 03:28:29.560
“July.”

03:28:29.560 --> 03:28:32.560
Again, capital letters here.

03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:34.180
‘J-u-l’ period.

03:28:34.180 --> 03:28:36.029
The next one.

03:28:36.029 --> 03:28:37.169
“August.”

03:28:37.169 --> 03:28:38.310
“August.”

03:28:38.310 --> 03:28:39.310
This is “aww”.

03:28:39.310 --> 03:28:40.310
‘A-u’ is “aww”.

03:28:40.310 --> 03:28:41.310
“August.”

03:28:41.310 --> 03:28:42.310
Ok and the short form.

03:28:42.310 --> 03:28:43.310
‘A-u-g’ period.

03:28:43.310 --> 03:28:44.310
“September.”

03:28:44.310 --> 03:28:45.310
“September.”

03:28:45.310 --> 03:28:46.310
“September.”

03:28:46.310 --> 03:28:47.310
‘S-e-p’ period.

03:28:47.310 --> 03:28:48.310
“October.”

03:28:48.310 --> 03:28:49.310
“October.”

03:28:49.310 --> 03:28:50.310
“October.”

03:28:50.310 --> 03:28:51.310
‘O-c-t’ period.

03:28:51.310 --> 03:28:52.310
“November.”

03:28:52.310 --> 03:28:53.310
“November.”

03:28:53.310 --> 03:28:54.310
“November.”

03:28:54.310 --> 03:28:55.310
Ok, this is a ‘v’.

03:28:55.310 --> 03:28:56.310
“Vvv.”

03:28:56.310 --> 03:28:57.310
“November.”

03:28:57.310 --> 03:28:58.310
“November.”

03:28:58.310 --> 03:28:59.310
And the last month.

03:28:59.310 --> 03:29:00.310
“December.”

03:29:00.310 --> 03:29:01.310
“December.”

03:29:01.310 --> 03:29:02.310
Ok, so let’s go through the last six again.

03:29:02.310 --> 03:29:03.310
“July.”

03:29:03.310 --> 03:29:04.310
“July.”

03:29:04.310 --> 03:29:05.310
“August.”

03:29:05.310 --> 03:29:06.310
“August.”

03:29:06.310 --> 03:29:07.310
“September.”

03:29:07.310 --> 03:29:08.310
“September.”

03:29:08.310 --> 03:29:09.310
“October.”

03:29:09.310 --> 03:29:10.310
“October.”

03:29:10.310 --> 03:29:11.310
“November.”

03:29:11.310 --> 03:29:12.310
“November.”

03:29:12.310 --> 03:29:13.310
“December.”

03:29:13.310 --> 03:29:14.310
“December.”

03:29:14.310 --> 03:29:15.310
Whew…that’s all the twelve months.

03:29:15.310 --> 03:29:16.310
Ok…

03:29:16.310 --> 03:29:17.310
So, let’s move on.

03:29:17.310 --> 03:29:18.310
Ok, we’re going to look at three important
questions, should know when asking about ‘month’.

03:29:18.310 --> 03:29:19.310
Here’s the first question.

03:29:19.310 --> 03:29:20.310
“What month is it?”

03:29:20.310 --> 03:29:21.310
Ok…

03:29:21.310 --> 03:29:22.310
Now, remember with the pronunciation of ‘month’.

03:29:22.310 --> 03:29:23.310
“Month.”

03:29:23.310 --> 03:29:24.310
You tongue should come out.

03:29:24.310 --> 03:29:25.310
“Month.”

03:29:25.310 --> 03:29:26.310
“What month is it?”

03:29:26.310 --> 03:29:27.310
“What month is it?”

03:29:27.310 --> 03:29:28.310
Ok…

03:29:28.310 --> 03:29:29.310
Your answer will begin with ‘It’s…’;
‘It is’…’It’s’.

03:29:29.310 --> 03:29:30.310
“It’s January.”

03:29:30.310 --> 03:29:31.310
“What month is it?”

03:29:31.310 --> 03:29:32.310
“It’s January.”

03:29:32.310 --> 03:29:33.310
Alright…

03:29:33.310 --> 03:29:34.310
Some people may say, “Which month is it?”

03:29:34.310 --> 03:29:35.310
Ok…

03:29:35.310 --> 03:29:36.310
“Which” is ok…”What” is ok, but
more common is the ‘What’.

03:29:36.310 --> 03:29:37.310
“What month is it?”

03:29:37.310 --> 03:29:38.310
“It’s January.”

03:29:38.310 --> 03:29:39.310
Alright…

03:29:39.310 --> 03:29:40.310
Next question.

03:29:40.310 --> 03:29:41.310
“What’s next month?”

03:29:41.310 --> 03:29:42.310
Ok…

03:29:42.310 --> 03:29:43.310
“What’s next month?”

03:29:43.310 --> 03:29:44.310
Ok, so, this is asking about the future…’next
month’.

03:29:44.310 --> 03:29:45.310
“What’s next month?”

03:29:45.310 --> 03:29:46.310
Now, some people will answer…

03:29:46.310 --> 03:29:47.310
“It ‘will be’…

03:29:47.310 --> 03:29:48.310
February.”

03:29:48.310 --> 03:29:49.310
Ok, that’s ok.

03:29:49.310 --> 03:29:50.310
But more common is just simply “It’s February.”

03:29:50.310 --> 03:29:51.310
Ok…

03:29:51.310 --> 03:29:52.310
This is probably what most people will say.

03:29:52.310 --> 03:29:53.310
“It’s February.”

03:29:53.310 --> 03:29:54.310
“What’s next month?”

03:29:54.310 --> 03:29:55.310
“It’s February.”

03:29:55.310 --> 03:29:56.310
The last question.

03:29:56.310 --> 03:29:57.310
“What was last month?”

03:29:57.310 --> 03:29:58.310
..in the past.

03:29:58.310 --> 03:29:59.310
Ok, we’re using ‘was’…in the past.

03:29:59.310 --> 03:30:00.310
“What was last month?”

03:30:00.310 --> 03:30:01.310
“It was…December.”

03:30:01.310 --> 03:30:02.310
“It was December.”

03:30:02.310 --> 03:30:03.310
Ok…

03:30:03.310 --> 03:30:04.310
“What month is it?”

03:30:04.310 --> 03:30:05.310
“It’s January.”

03:30:05.310 --> 03:30:06.310
“What’s next month?”

03:30:06.310 --> 03:30:07.310
“It’s February.”

03:30:07.310 --> 03:30:08.310
“What was last month?”

03:30:08.310 --> 03:30:09.310
“It was December.”

03:30:09.310 --> 03:30:10.310
Ok…

03:30:10.310 --> 03:30:11.310
So, that’s how you ask and answer about
the months.

03:30:11.310 --> 03:30:12.310
Ok…

03:30:12.310 --> 03:30:13.310
Let’s go to the next part.

03:30:13.310 --> 03:30:14.310
Here are three more questions on how to use
‘months’ in a sentence.

03:30:14.310 --> 03:30:15.310
Ok…

03:30:15.310 --> 03:30:16.310
Let’s take a look.

03:30:16.310 --> 03:30:17.310
These questions are talking about some activity
or event that will happen in a month.

03:30:17.310 --> 03:30:18.310
Ok…

03:30:18.310 --> 03:30:19.310
So when we’re talking about an activity
or event that will happen in a month, we need

03:30:19.310 --> 03:30:20.310
to use the preposition ‘in’.

03:30:20.310 --> 03:30:21.310
Ok, when we’re talking about ‘Days of
the Week’, we had to use the preposition

03:30:21.310 --> 03:30:22.310
‘on’.

03:30:22.310 --> 03:30:23.310
But for ‘months’, we use the preposition
‘in’.

03:30:23.310 --> 03:30:24.310
Remember that.

03:30:24.310 --> 03:30:25.310
Ok, so here’s some questions.

03:30:25.310 --> 03:30:26.310
“Which month were you born?”

03:30:26.310 --> 03:30:27.310
Ok, we’re at the end of the video, but before
I go, I want to talk about some mistakes again.

03:30:27.310 --> 03:30:28.310
Ahhh…please be careful with your spelling.

03:30:28.310 --> 03:30:29.310
Let’s take a look at these three.

03:30:29.310 --> 03:30:30.310
These three are very common.

03:30:30.310 --> 03:30:31.310
As you can see, “No”.

03:30:31.310 --> 03:30:32.310
Don’t spell these words like this.

03:30:32.310 --> 03:30:33.310
Now the first one…

03:30:33.310 --> 03:30:34.310
We can guess this month is “February”,
but the students are confused with the ‘V’

03:30:34.310 --> 03:30:35.310
and the ‘b’.

03:30:35.310 --> 03:30:36.310
They’re writing “Fevruary”.

03:30:36.310 --> 03:30:37.310
Also, they’re missing a ‘u’.

03:30:37.310 --> 03:30:38.310
Ok, so there’s lots of mistakes with spelling
‘February’.

03:30:38.310 --> 03:30:39.310
Be careful.

03:30:39.310 --> 03:30:40.310
Don’t do this.

03:30:40.310 --> 03:30:41.310
The next one is “April”.

03:30:41.310 --> 03:30:42.310
“April.”

03:30:42.310 --> 03:30:43.310
But they’re writing a ‘v’.

03:30:43.310 --> 03:30:44.310
I don’t know why they’re writing a ‘v’,
but they’re writing a ‘v’.

03:30:44.310 --> 03:30:45.310
It should be a ‘p’.

03:30:45.310 --> 03:30:46.699
So don’t…don’t write “Avril”.

03:30:46.699 --> 03:30:48.379
“April.”

03:30:48.379 --> 03:30:49.379
And the last one.

03:30:49.379 --> 03:30:51.329
I can understand the mistake.

03:30:51.329 --> 03:30:52.329
“December.”

03:30:52.329 --> 03:30:53.329
“December.”

03:30:53.329 --> 03:30:58.430
Ok, I understand because this is actually
a ‘c’.

03:30:58.430 --> 03:31:00.369
“sss”…it makes an ‘s’ sound.

03:31:00.369 --> 03:31:01.369
“December.”

03:31:01.369 --> 03:31:02.839
But, you got to be careful.

03:31:02.839 --> 03:31:04.840
You need the ‘c’.

03:31:04.840 --> 03:31:05.840
“December.”

03:31:05.840 --> 03:31:06.840
Alright…

03:31:06.840 --> 03:31:08.959
So, anyway, with the ‘s’…don’t write
like that.

03:31:08.959 --> 03:31:14.279
Ok, so you got to be very careful with the
spelling of the months.

03:31:14.279 --> 03:31:15.279
Alright…

03:31:15.279 --> 03:31:16.770
So that’s the ‘Months of the Year’.

03:31:16.770 --> 03:31:18.850
I hope you understand.

03:31:18.850 --> 03:31:21.100
Ahhh..there’s twelve of them.

03:31:21.100 --> 03:31:24.620
I know it takes a lot of practice to pronounce
and to spell.

03:31:24.620 --> 03:31:28.560
But you need to do a lot of self-study to
master them.

03:31:28.560 --> 03:31:29.560
Ok…

03:31:29.560 --> 03:31:30.899
I want you to be perfect with them.

03:31:30.899 --> 03:31:33.489
Ok, that’s it for this video.

03:31:33.489 --> 03:31:36.789
See you next time.

03:31:36.789 --> 03:31:42.470
Hello, everyone.

03:31:42.470 --> 03:31:48.100
In this video, we are going to talk about
how to express the year in English.

03:31:48.100 --> 03:31:53.850
Ok, it’s a little bit difficult, but I know
after this video, you will understand…and

03:31:53.850 --> 03:31:56.930
you’ll be able to do it very well.

03:31:56.930 --> 03:31:58.430
Let’s take a look.

03:31:58.430 --> 03:32:01.619
So, on the board, I wrote some years.

03:32:01.619 --> 03:32:02.619
Ok…

03:32:02.619 --> 03:32:05.680
So, you just have to listen and follow me.

03:32:05.680 --> 03:32:09.479
The first year up here, is the year I was
born.

03:32:09.479 --> 03:32:11.999
Yes, I’m quite old.

03:32:11.999 --> 03:32:15.470
So how would we express this year in English?

03:32:15.470 --> 03:32:19.039
We’re going to look at the first part.

03:32:19.039 --> 03:32:21.880
“Nineteen.”
…and the last part, “Seventy-five.”

03:32:21.880 --> 03:32:27.049
So, we’re going yo divide that into “Nineteen
seventy-five”.

03:32:27.049 --> 03:32:28.789
“Nineteen seventy-five.”

03:32:28.789 --> 03:32:35.239
Never, never, never, never, never say “one
thousand nine hundred and seventy-five”.

03:32:35.239 --> 03:32:36.239
No.

03:32:36.239 --> 03:32:40.899
The way to express this year:
“Nineteen seventy-five.”

03:32:40.899 --> 03:32:43.420
Let’s look at the next one.

03:32:43.420 --> 03:32:44.819
This is “Nineteen seventy-five.”

03:32:44.819 --> 03:32:47.209
This is “Nineteen ninety-nine.”

03:32:47.209 --> 03:32:48.299
Ok…

03:32:48.299 --> 03:32:50.489
“Nineteen seventy-five.”

03:32:50.489 --> 03:32:52.669
“Nineteen ninety-nine.”

03:32:52.669 --> 03:32:54.390
The next one…Ok….

03:32:54.390 --> 03:32:57.799
This is a little different because…ahh…there’s
three zeros.

03:32:57.799 --> 03:33:01.600
So, for this year, we only say, “two thousand”.

03:33:01.600 --> 03:33:04.770
Ok, there’s one way to say it.

03:33:04.770 --> 03:33:07.289
“Two thousand.”

03:33:07.289 --> 03:33:08.409
The next one.

03:33:08.409 --> 03:33:09.409
Ok…

03:33:09.409 --> 03:33:15.319
Now, the next one…there’s actually two
ways to express it in English.

03:33:15.319 --> 03:33:19.549
One way is, “two thousand one”.

03:33:19.549 --> 03:33:22.199
Another way is, “twenty-oh-one”.

03:33:22.199 --> 03:33:23.419
Ok…

03:33:23.419 --> 03:33:26.609
“Two thousand one.”

03:33:26.609 --> 03:33:27.720
Or…

03:33:27.720 --> 03:33:28.840
“Twenty-oh-one.”

03:33:28.840 --> 03:33:34.799
Ok, remember, ‘zeros’ we can call “oh”.

03:33:34.799 --> 03:33:36.979
“Twenty-oh-one.”

03:33:36.979 --> 03:33:38.249
The next one.

03:33:38.249 --> 03:33:40.419
“Two thousand twelve.”

03:33:40.419 --> 03:33:41.419
Or…

03:33:41.419 --> 03:33:43.159
“Twenty twelve.”

03:33:43.159 --> 03:33:45.919
Again, there’s two ways.

03:33:45.919 --> 03:33:48.739
“Two thousand twelve.”

03:33:48.739 --> 03:33:51.520
“Twenty twelve.”

03:33:51.520 --> 03:33:52.520
Next one…similar.

03:33:52.520 --> 03:33:54.620
“Two thousand thirteen.”

03:33:54.620 --> 03:33:58.930
“Twenty thirteen.”

03:33:58.930 --> 03:34:01.109
And the last one…in the future…

03:34:01.109 --> 03:34:02.510
“Twenty twenty.”

03:34:02.510 --> 03:34:03.510
Or…

03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:05.539
“Two thousand twenty.”

03:34:05.539 --> 03:34:11.470
Ok…so from here…going all the ‘two thousands’,
there’s two ways to express it.

03:34:11.470 --> 03:34:12.949
So, sometimes that’s confusing.

03:34:12.949 --> 03:34:15.549
So, let’s go through the list again.

03:34:15.549 --> 03:34:17.050
“Nineteen seventy-five.”

03:34:17.050 --> 03:34:18.589
“Nineteen ninety-nine.”

03:34:18.589 --> 03:34:20.129
“Two thousand.”

03:34:20.129 --> 03:34:22.539
“Two thousand one.”

03:34:22.539 --> 03:34:23.539
Or…

03:34:23.539 --> 03:34:24.539
“Twenty-oh-one.”

03:34:24.539 --> 03:34:26.239
“Two thousand twelve.”

03:34:26.239 --> 03:34:27.239
Or…

03:34:27.239 --> 03:34:28.579
“Twenty twelve.”

03:34:28.579 --> 03:34:30.640
“Two thousand thirteen.”

03:34:30.640 --> 03:34:32.629
“Twenty thirteen.”

03:34:32.629 --> 03:34:34.779
“Two thousand twenty.”

03:34:34.779 --> 03:34:35.779
Or…

03:34:35.779 --> 03:34:37.220
“Twenty twenty.”

03:34:37.220 --> 03:34:38.220
Alright…

03:34:38.220 --> 03:34:40.810
So that’s how we express years in English.

03:34:40.810 --> 03:34:42.770
Let’s do some more practice.

03:34:42.770 --> 03:34:49.479
Ok, so let’s take a look at a few questions,
so we can understand how to use ‘year’

03:34:49.479 --> 03:34:51.449
in a sentence.

03:34:51.449 --> 03:34:54.709
Questions one here:
“What year is it now?”

03:34:54.709 --> 03:34:56.970
“What year is it now?”

03:34:56.970 --> 03:35:00.709
Because it’s now, we want to start our sentence
with “It’s”.

03:35:00.709 --> 03:35:03.039
“What year is it now?”

03:35:03.039 --> 03:35:05.369
“It’s two thousand twelve.”

03:35:05.369 --> 03:35:06.369
Or…

03:35:06.369 --> 03:35:07.369
“Twenty-twelve.”

03:35:07.369 --> 03:35:10.369
Ok, “What year is it now?”

03:35:10.369 --> 03:35:11.619
“It’s Twenty-twelve.”

03:35:11.619 --> 03:35:16.189
Again, you should use “it’s”, but of
course it’s ok just to say the year.

03:35:16.189 --> 03:35:18.699
But I prefer a full sentence.

03:35:18.699 --> 03:35:20.229
“It’s two thousand twelve.”

03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:23.079
Let’s look at the next question.

03:35:23.079 --> 03:35:25.479
“What year were you born?”

03:35:25.479 --> 03:35:26.959
“What year were you born?”

03:35:26.959 --> 03:35:30.660
Again, you came out of your mother…as a
baby…

03:35:30.660 --> 03:35:32.839
“What year were you born?”

03:35:32.839 --> 03:35:37.399
Ok, with the ‘years’, you want to use
the preposition ‘in’.

03:35:37.399 --> 03:35:38.399
Ok…

03:35:38.399 --> 03:35:42.840
Now, with ‘days’, we use the preposition
‘on’.

03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:45.909
With ‘months’, we use the preposition
‘in’.

03:35:45.909 --> 03:35:49.880
And with ‘years’, we must use the preposition
‘in’.

03:35:49.880 --> 03:35:53.020
So, “What year were you born?”

03:35:53.020 --> 03:35:55.619
“In nineteen seventy-five.”

03:35:55.619 --> 03:35:57.880
Ok, that’s the year I was born.

03:35:57.880 --> 03:36:01.289
“In nineteen seventy-five.”

03:36:01.289 --> 03:36:02.910
The last question.

03:36:02.910 --> 03:36:04.659
Very important to Korea.

03:36:04.659 --> 03:36:08.090
“When is the Pyeongchang Olympics?”

03:36:08.090 --> 03:36:09.739
Ok, coming soon.

03:36:09.739 --> 03:36:12.310
“When is the Pyeongchang Olympics?”

03:36:12.310 --> 03:36:16.779
“In”, ok, again, ‘in’ is our preposition.

03:36:16.779 --> 03:36:19.499
“In two thousand eighteen.”

03:36:19.499 --> 03:36:20.529
Or…

03:36:20.529 --> 03:36:23.189
“In twenty eighteen.”

03:36:23.189 --> 03:36:24.819
Alright…

03:36:24.819 --> 03:36:28.239
So those are a few examples of how to use
it in a sentence.

03:36:28.239 --> 03:36:31.350
Ahh..I hope you understand these examples.

03:36:31.350 --> 03:36:33.189
Using years…ahhh..is very…very easy.

03:36:33.189 --> 03:36:36.579
Ok, they’re easy to express.

03:36:36.579 --> 03:36:38.899
Just remember to use the preposition ‘in’.

03:36:38.899 --> 03:36:39.899
Ok…

03:36:39.899 --> 03:36:45.249
That’s it for ‘years’ and I will see
you next video.

03:36:45.249 --> 03:36:51.089
Hello, everyone.

03:36:51.089 --> 03:36:56.580
In this video, we’re going to talk about
how to express the date in English.

03:36:56.580 --> 03:37:01.040
That can be very difficult because you have
to know your months.

03:37:01.040 --> 03:37:03.379
You have to know your ordinal numbers.

03:37:03.379 --> 03:37:06.209
You have to know how to express your years.

03:37:06.209 --> 03:37:11.079
So, this is a very advanced video, but it’s
a good video to learn.

03:37:11.079 --> 03:37:14.510
Ahh…so, I’m going to start with this question.

03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:16.430
“What’s the date, today?”

03:37:16.430 --> 03:37:23.879
Now, don’t confuse this question with, “What’s
the day, today?”, because the day is only

03:37:23.879 --> 03:37:28.449
asking about “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday…so
on.”

03:37:28.449 --> 03:37:30.180
This question is, “What’s the date..?”

03:37:30.180 --> 03:37:31.180
Ok…

03:37:31.180 --> 03:37:33.359
So, we…it’s very different than ‘day’.

03:37:33.359 --> 03:37:39.180
So, there’s two styles here of how to express
the date.

03:37:39.180 --> 03:37:41.640
One style is British style.

03:37:41.640 --> 03:37:44.989
And one style is American style or Canadian
style.

03:37:44.989 --> 03:37:46.580
We use this.

03:37:46.580 --> 03:37:49.279
Ok, so “What’s the date, today?”

03:37:49.279 --> 03:37:50.739
And it’s the same date.

03:37:50.739 --> 03:37:56.209
They put the ‘fourteenth’, ‘March’,
‘two thousand thirteen’.

03:37:56.209 --> 03:37:57.439
Ok, so how..

03:37:57.439 --> 03:37:58.869
how would they express that?

03:37:58.869 --> 03:38:00.470
“What’s the date, today?”

03:38:00.470 --> 03:38:05.499
“It’s the fourteenth of March two thousand
thirteen.”

03:38:05.499 --> 03:38:07.290
Or “Twenty-thirteen.”

03:38:07.290 --> 03:38:08.649
Ok…

03:38:08.649 --> 03:38:09.649
Short form.

03:38:09.649 --> 03:38:12.449
‘Fourteen’, ‘three’, ‘thirteen’.

03:38:12.449 --> 03:38:16.850
Now they use a…’day’, ‘month’, ‘year’.

03:38:16.850 --> 03:38:24.359
Ok, but I know in Korea, you use the opposite
‘year’, ‘month’, ‘day’.

03:38:24.359 --> 03:38:26.549
But the British style is opposite.

03:38:26.549 --> 03:38:32.260
Alright, now here is the American style and
the style I want to show you because I’m

03:38:32.260 --> 03:38:33.260
Canadian.

03:38:33.260 --> 03:38:34.750
I use this, also.

03:38:34.750 --> 03:38:38.069
“What’s the date, today?”

03:38:38.069 --> 03:38:41.140
“March fourteenth…fourteenth, twenty thirteen.”

03:38:41.140 --> 03:38:44.539
“March fourteenth, twenty thirteen.”

03:38:44.539 --> 03:38:47.779
‘Three’, ‘fourteen’, ‘thirteen’.

03:38:47.779 --> 03:38:51.630
That’s how you would express it short style.

03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:52.630
Ok…

03:38:52.630 --> 03:38:55.089
Now both ways are ok…doesn’t matter.

03:38:55.089 --> 03:38:57.640
But this is how you would express a ‘date’.

03:38:57.640 --> 03:38:59.109
Put your ‘month’.

03:38:59.109 --> 03:39:00.310
Capital letter.

03:39:00.310 --> 03:39:01.770
Put your ordinal number.

03:39:01.770 --> 03:39:03.470
This is “fourteenth”.

03:39:03.470 --> 03:39:06.009
A ‘comma’…and the year.

03:39:06.009 --> 03:39:11.369
Ok, and you would read it as “March fourteenth,
twenty thirteen.”

03:39:11.369 --> 03:39:14.160
Alright, so that’s how you express the ‘date’.

03:39:14.160 --> 03:39:16.840
Let’s do some more practice.

03:39:16.840 --> 03:39:23.449
Ok, here are some examples to help us understand
how to express the ‘dates’.

03:39:23.449 --> 03:39:26.430
First, let’s look at this question.

03:39:26.430 --> 03:39:28.970
“When is payday?”

03:39:28.970 --> 03:39:32.589
Now, “payday” is a very important day.

03:39:32.589 --> 03:39:35.499
That’s when you get your money from your
job.

03:39:35.499 --> 03:39:36.899
“When is payday?”

03:39:36.899 --> 03:39:40.939
So, I’m going to begin my answer with “It’s”.

03:39:40.939 --> 03:39:42.060
“It is…

03:39:42.060 --> 03:39:44.079
It’s”
“When is payday?”

03:39:44.079 --> 03:39:49.659
Ok, and you can see when I’m expressing
the ‘date’, I’m always going to use

03:39:49.659 --> 03:39:51.930
the preposition ‘on’.

03:39:51.930 --> 03:39:53.159
The preposition ‘on’.

03:39:53.159 --> 03:39:54.159
Ok…

03:39:54.159 --> 03:39:55.439
So, “When is payday?”

03:39:55.439 --> 03:39:57.459
“It’s on Monday.”

03:39:57.459 --> 03:39:59.409
That’s very simple.

03:39:59.409 --> 03:40:01.680
“It’s on the sixteenth.”

03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:05.220
Ok, “It’s on the sixteenth of this month.”

03:40:05.220 --> 03:40:11.579
Now, if your just going to focus on the date
here, ‘Sixteenth’, we always need a ‘the’.

03:40:11.579 --> 03:40:12.579
“The sixteenth.”

03:40:12.579 --> 03:40:16.879
Alright, the next one, we’re going to combine
these.

03:40:16.879 --> 03:40:18.789
We’re going to put these two together.

03:40:18.789 --> 03:40:20.619
“When is payday?”

03:40:20.619 --> 03:40:24.630
“It’s on Monday the sixteenth.”

03:40:24.630 --> 03:40:26.399
Ok, so we have “On Monday”.

03:40:26.399 --> 03:40:27.399
That’s ok.

03:40:27.399 --> 03:40:28.750
“On the sixteenth.”

03:40:28.750 --> 03:40:29.979
That’s ok.

03:40:29.979 --> 03:40:31.979
“On Monday the sixteenth.”

03:40:31.979 --> 03:40:33.270
That’s ok, too.

03:40:33.270 --> 03:40:38.799
Ok, all of them are ok, but this one…ahh…there’s
no confusion.

03:40:38.799 --> 03:40:39.879
This is very detailed.

03:40:39.879 --> 03:40:43.039
Alright, let’s look at the last two.

03:40:43.039 --> 03:40:44.779
Now, “When is payday?”

03:40:44.779 --> 03:40:47.739
“It’s on June sixteenth.”

03:40:47.739 --> 03:40:49.919
Ok, you want to focus on the month sometimes.

03:40:49.919 --> 03:40:52.819
“It’s on June sixteenth.”

03:40:52.819 --> 03:40:55.310
And let’s put all of these together.

03:40:55.310 --> 03:40:56.939
“When is payday?”

03:40:56.939 --> 03:41:01.569
“It’s on Monday June sixteenth.”

03:41:01.569 --> 03:41:07.609
Ok, if you want to be very detailed and make
sure there’s no confusion, your going to

03:41:07.609 --> 03:41:11.319
say the ‘day’, the ‘month’ and the
‘date’ here.

03:41:11.319 --> 03:41:12.649
Ok, “When is payday?”

03:41:12.649 --> 03:41:15.949
“It’s on Monday June sixteenth.”

03:41:15.949 --> 03:41:16.949
Ok…

03:41:16.949 --> 03:41:20.310
So there are many ways to express the same
thing.

03:41:20.310 --> 03:41:23.379
Ok, it depends on the situation.

03:41:23.379 --> 03:41:28.759
But you have to be familiar with all these
ways…cause…which one is the best way?

03:41:28.759 --> 03:41:30.890
Well, there is no best way here.

03:41:30.890 --> 03:41:32.520
Ahh…it depends on the person.

03:41:32.520 --> 03:41:35.010
Everyone’s going to say it a little bit
different.

03:41:35.010 --> 03:41:38.089
Alright, let’s move on to some questions.

03:41:38.089 --> 03:41:40.640
The first question here.

03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:42.540
“When were you born?”

03:41:42.540 --> 03:41:44.409
Ok, “When were you born?”

03:41:44.409 --> 03:41:47.669
Again, you came out of your mother as a baby.

03:41:47.669 --> 03:41:49.239
“When were you born?”

03:41:49.239 --> 03:41:52.149
This is a very detailed answer.

03:41:52.149 --> 03:41:54.359
Ok, so this is when I was born.

03:41:54.359 --> 03:41:59.649
“On March twentieth, nineteen seventy-five.”

03:41:59.649 --> 03:42:05.350
Ok, so I’m going to put the capital on ‘March’,
‘twentieth’, comma, ‘nineteen seventy-five’.

03:42:05.350 --> 03:42:09.660
That’s how I would write and say that ‘date’.

03:42:09.660 --> 03:42:11.879
Let’s move on to the next question.

03:42:11.879 --> 03:42:13.709
“When is your birthday?”

03:42:13.709 --> 03:42:16.579
Ok, they’re very similar questions.

03:42:16.579 --> 03:42:17.970
“When were you born?”

03:42:17.970 --> 03:42:19.229
“When is your birthday?”

03:42:19.229 --> 03:42:23.419
Ok, so, “When is your birthday?”…doesn’t
really care about the year.

03:42:23.419 --> 03:42:26.260
It’s more about the ‘month’ and the
‘date’.

03:42:26.260 --> 03:42:28.180
Ok, so, “When is your birthday?”

03:42:28.180 --> 03:42:30.229
“On March twentieth.”

03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:31.229
“On March twentieth.”

03:42:31.229 --> 03:42:35.959
That’s the date of my birthday.

03:42:35.959 --> 03:42:36.959
Next one.

03:42:36.959 --> 03:42:38.489
“When is Valentine’s Day?”

03:42:38.489 --> 03:42:41.100
A very good and happy day.

03:42:41.100 --> 03:42:43.409
“When is Valentine’s Day?”

03:42:43.409 --> 03:42:46.329
“On February fourteenth.”

03:42:46.329 --> 03:42:49.439
“On February fourteenth.”

03:42:49.439 --> 03:42:50.470
The last question.

03:42:50.470 --> 03:42:52.539
“When will you go to Spain?”

03:42:52.539 --> 03:42:54.430
“When will you go to Spain?”

03:42:54.430 --> 03:42:55.600
Your asking your friend.

03:42:55.600 --> 03:42:57.829
“When will you go to Spain?”

03:42:57.829 --> 03:43:02.029
And maybe she answers very quickly…”Oh,
on the nineteenth”.

03:43:02.029 --> 03:43:03.919
“On the nineteenth.”

03:43:03.919 --> 03:43:04.919
Alright…

03:43:04.919 --> 03:43:11.169
So, I hope you have a better understanding
of how to express the ‘date’ in English.

03:43:11.169 --> 03:43:15.810
Takes a lot of self-study and practice, but
I know you can…you can understand if you

03:43:15.810 --> 03:43:17.430
really really try.

03:43:17.430 --> 03:43:19.749
That’s it for this video.

03:43:19.749 --> 03:43:22.680
See you next time.

03:43:22.680 --> 03:43:27.819
Hi, everyone.

03:43:27.819 --> 03:43:30.460
In this video, we’re going to talk about
the seasons.

03:43:30.460 --> 03:43:33.089
Ok, it’s very easy.

03:43:33.089 --> 03:43:34.689
Because there’s only four seasons.

03:43:34.689 --> 03:43:37.270
Alright, and you probably already know them.

03:43:37.270 --> 03:43:39.010
Here they are.

03:43:39.010 --> 03:43:42.369
And the first one is “spring’.

03:43:42.369 --> 03:43:44.279
“Spring.’

03:43:44.279 --> 03:43:47.819
And ‘spring’ is when the flowers come
out.

03:43:47.819 --> 03:43:48.819
Ok…

03:43:48.819 --> 03:43:51.310
The next season.

03:43:51.310 --> 03:43:53.210
“Summer.”

03:43:53.210 --> 03:43:55.109
“Summer.”

03:43:55.109 --> 03:43:56.109
Summer is hot.

03:43:56.109 --> 03:44:00.140
Summer is a good time to go to the beach.

03:44:00.140 --> 03:44:01.520
Summer is my favorite season.

03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:03.399
I like hot weather.

03:44:03.399 --> 03:44:05.680
Alright, the next season.

03:44:05.680 --> 03:44:06.680
“Autumn.”

03:44:06.680 --> 03:44:07.680
“Autumn.”

03:44:07.680 --> 03:44:10.899
Ok, this has an ‘au’.

03:44:10.899 --> 03:44:11.899
“Autumn.”

03:44:11.899 --> 03:44:12.899
“Autumn.”

03:44:12.899 --> 03:44:17.569
So, instead of “autumn”, an easier way
is just to say, “fall”.

03:44:17.569 --> 03:44:18.569
You can say, “autumn”, or “fall”.

03:44:18.569 --> 03:44:19.840
Both are ok.

03:44:19.840 --> 03:44:22.399
They mean the same thing.

03:44:22.399 --> 03:44:29.759
So, of course, in ‘autumn’, the leaves
on the trees fall.

03:44:29.759 --> 03:44:31.829
And the last season.

03:44:31.829 --> 03:44:33.009
“Winter.”

03:44:33.009 --> 03:44:34.189
Ok…”Winter.”

03:44:34.189 --> 03:44:39.350
‘Winter’, of course, is very cold… and
you build snowmen in winter.

03:44:39.350 --> 03:44:42.159
Uhh…I don’t like winter very much.

03:44:42.159 --> 03:44:44.260
Ok, so those are the four seasons.

03:44:44.260 --> 03:44:46.489
Let’s do some extra practice.

03:44:46.489 --> 03:44:50.339
Ok, for our practice, I have three quick questions.

03:44:50.339 --> 03:44:51.869
Let’s look at the first question.

03:44:51.869 --> 03:44:53.729
“What season is now?”

03:44:53.729 --> 03:44:56.229
“What season is right now?”

03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:57.229
Ok…

03:44:57.229 --> 03:45:01.489
Because it’s ‘now’, we have to begin
with “It’s”.

03:45:01.489 --> 03:45:02.529
Ok…

03:45:02.529 --> 03:45:04.609
“It is…”

03:45:04.609 --> 03:45:06.689
“It’s summer.”

03:45:06.689 --> 03:45:10.159
Ok, I made this video now.

03:45:10.159 --> 03:45:12.419
For me, it’s summer.

03:45:12.419 --> 03:45:16.909
When you’re watching this video, maybe it’s
another season.

03:45:16.909 --> 03:45:18.869
Alright, “What season is now?”

03:45:18.869 --> 03:45:19.890
“It’s summer.”

03:45:19.890 --> 03:45:22.979
Remember, right now, we always use “It’s”.

03:45:22.979 --> 03:45:25.109
Ok, the next questions.

03:45:25.109 --> 03:45:26.589
“When is Halloween?”

03:45:26.589 --> 03:45:30.109
Ok, so what season is Halloween?

03:45:30.109 --> 03:45:33.879
Well, we have to use the preposition ‘in’.

03:45:33.879 --> 03:45:34.989
Ok…

03:45:34.989 --> 03:45:37.369
“When is Halloween?”

03:45:37.369 --> 03:45:38.640
“In….”

03:45:38.640 --> 03:45:41.180
“In autumn.”

03:45:41.180 --> 03:45:44.989
Ok, “In autumn.”

03:45:44.989 --> 03:45:46.259
Or…

03:45:46.259 --> 03:45:48.799
“In fall.”

03:45:48.799 --> 03:45:50.079
Ok…

03:45:50.079 --> 03:45:53.569
So remember, with the seasons, we need the
preposition ‘in’.

03:45:53.569 --> 03:45:55.289
“When is Halloween?”

03:45:55.289 --> 03:45:56.799
“In autumn.”

03:45:56.799 --> 03:45:58.129
“In fall.”

03:45:58.129 --> 03:45:59.249
And the last question.

03:45:59.249 --> 03:46:00.539
“When is Christmas?”

03:46:00.539 --> 03:46:07.369
Ok, what season?

03:46:07.369 --> 03:46:10.009
Of course, “In winter.”

03:46:10.009 --> 03:46:11.600
“When is Christmas?”

03:46:11.600 --> 03:46:13.409
“It’s in winter.”

03:46:13.409 --> 03:46:14.409
Ok…

03:46:14.409 --> 03:46:15.409
So that’s the seasons.

03:46:15.409 --> 03:46:19.430
Remember, when we’re talking about ‘now’,
we need “it’s”…if we’re talking

03:46:19.430 --> 03:46:21.290
about the season now.

03:46:21.290 --> 03:46:24.479
And other seasons, we need the preposition
‘in’.

03:46:24.479 --> 03:46:25.479
Ok…

03:46:25.479 --> 03:46:26.640
That’s seasons.

03:46:26.640 --> 03:46:28.620
I hope you understand.

03:46:28.620 --> 03:46:31.669
See you next time.

03:46:31.669 --> 03:46:37.029
Hello, everyone.

03:46:37.029 --> 03:46:40.170
Welcome to this ‘Time Expressions’ video.

03:46:40.170 --> 03:46:44.619
In this video, we are going to talk about
how to express the time of day.

03:46:44.619 --> 03:46:46.239
Ok, it’s very simple.

03:46:46.239 --> 03:46:52.159
And you would talk about the ‘time of day’
to express your routine; what you do in the

03:46:52.159 --> 03:46:53.810
different times of day.

03:46:53.810 --> 03:46:55.919
Let’s take a look at the board.

03:46:55.919 --> 03:46:57.830
I have a question.

03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:59.260
“When do you…?”

03:46:59.260 --> 03:47:00.829
And let’s make a question.

03:47:00.829 --> 03:47:03.060
“When do you wake up?”

03:47:03.060 --> 03:47:04.060
Ok…

03:47:04.060 --> 03:47:05.739
“When do you wake up?”

03:47:05.739 --> 03:47:07.959
And you want to express the ‘time of day’.

03:47:07.959 --> 03:47:08.959
Very easy.

03:47:08.959 --> 03:47:10.060
“In the morning.”

03:47:10.060 --> 03:47:12.069
“When do you wake up?”

03:47:12.069 --> 03:47:13.600
“In the morning.”

03:47:13.600 --> 03:47:14.899
Make sure you have ‘the’.

03:47:14.899 --> 03:47:16.529
Don’t say “in morning”.

03:47:16.529 --> 03:47:17.579
“In the morning.”

03:47:17.579 --> 03:47:18.910
“When do you wake up?”

03:47:18.910 --> 03:47:19.910
“In the morning.”

03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:21.760
“When do you take a shower?”

03:47:21.760 --> 03:47:23.029
“In the morning.”

03:47:23.029 --> 03:47:25.060
“When do you go to work?”

03:47:25.060 --> 03:47:26.250
“In the morning.”

03:47:26.250 --> 03:47:27.449
Ok…

03:47:27.449 --> 03:47:29.890
Ahh…let’s look at the next one.

03:47:29.890 --> 03:47:31.369
“In the afternoon.”

03:47:31.369 --> 03:47:34.109
“When do you take a nap?”

03:47:34.109 --> 03:47:35.960
Ok, you take a quick sleep.

03:47:35.960 --> 03:47:37.510
“When do you take a nap?”

03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:39.270
“In the afternoon.”

03:47:39.270 --> 03:47:42.449
Ok, I like to take a nap, “In the afternoon.”

03:47:42.449 --> 03:47:46.749
“When do you go home?”

03:47:46.749 --> 03:47:48.689
After work, “When do you go home?”

03:47:48.689 --> 03:47:50.069
“In the evening.”

03:47:50.069 --> 03:47:52.470
“When do you eat dinner?”

03:47:52.470 --> 03:47:53.979
“In the evening.”

03:47:53.979 --> 03:47:55.890
“When do you watch TV?”

03:47:55.890 --> 03:47:57.359
“In the evening.”

03:47:57.359 --> 03:47:58.359
Ok…

03:47:58.359 --> 03:48:03.600
So, these are very easy ways to express the
different types…the different times of day.

03:48:03.600 --> 03:48:05.119
Make sure you have “in the”.

03:48:05.119 --> 03:48:07.560
Alright, let’s look at the next ones.

03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:08.560
Ahh…

03:48:08.560 --> 03:48:09.739
They’re using ‘at’.

03:48:09.739 --> 03:48:10.770
Ok…

03:48:10.770 --> 03:48:15.090
So this first one is using ‘”at night”.

03:48:15.090 --> 03:48:16.959
“In the evening.”

03:48:16.959 --> 03:48:18.659
“At night.”

03:48:18.659 --> 03:48:19.659
Very similar.

03:48:19.659 --> 03:48:24.439
But, “In the evening” is usually talking
about early evening.

03:48:24.439 --> 03:48:25.439
Ok…

03:48:25.439 --> 03:48:27.529
Around 6p.m. to 10p.m.

03:48:27.529 --> 03:48:30.430
Ok, that’s the evening time.

03:48:30.430 --> 03:48:31.560
Relaxing time.

03:48:31.560 --> 03:48:35.689
“At night” is probably after 10p.m.

03:48:35.689 --> 03:48:39.699
You know…you’re going into 1a.m., 2a.m.,
3a.m.

03:48:39.699 --> 03:48:41.319
Very late time.

03:48:41.319 --> 03:48:44.339
Ok, that’s usually when we say, “At night”.

03:48:44.339 --> 03:48:45.339
Alright…

03:48:45.339 --> 03:48:46.339
So…

03:48:46.339 --> 03:48:47.339
“When do you….?”

03:48:47.339 --> 03:48:52.380
Well, if I said, “When do you go home from
work?”

03:48:52.380 --> 03:48:54.629
And you said, “In the evening.”

03:48:54.629 --> 03:48:56.430
Ok, I know it’s early.

03:48:56.430 --> 03:49:01.520
But if you said…if I asked “When do you
go home from work?” and you said “At night”,

03:49:01.520 --> 03:49:03.529
I would think “Oh, very late”.

03:49:03.529 --> 03:49:05.430
Maybe after 10p.m.

03:49:05.430 --> 03:49:06.510
Alright…

03:49:06.510 --> 03:49:11.670
You have to be very careful walking on the
street ‘at night’.

03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:16.159
Alright, the next two are very exact times.

03:49:16.159 --> 03:49:20.079
Ok, “At noon”, “At midnight”.

03:49:20.079 --> 03:49:23.619
‘Noon’ is only 12:00p.m.

03:49:23.619 --> 03:49:24.850
That is ‘noon’.

03:49:24.850 --> 03:49:27.859
So, “When do you have lunch?”

03:49:27.859 --> 03:49:31.629
You can say, “At noon”.

03:49:31.629 --> 03:49:32.749
Alright…

03:49:32.749 --> 03:49:35.979
‘Midnight’ is only 12a.m.

03:49:35.979 --> 03:49:38.439
Ok, very late.

03:49:38.439 --> 03:49:41.329
“When do you go to bed?”

03:49:41.329 --> 03:49:43.449
“At midnight.”

03:49:43.449 --> 03:49:44.509
Ok…

03:49:44.509 --> 03:49:45.520
Very very late.

03:49:45.520 --> 03:49:46.520
Only…only 12p.m.

03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:48.029
Only 12a.m.

03:49:48.029 --> 03:49:51.189
They’re very exact times.

03:49:51.189 --> 03:49:55.220
Alright, so these are different ways to express
the ‘times of day’.

03:49:55.220 --> 03:49:57.720
Let’s take a look at a few examples.

03:49:57.720 --> 03:50:00.560
Ok, let’s look at these examples.

03:50:00.560 --> 03:50:02.520
The first one.

03:50:02.520 --> 03:50:05.289
“I exercise in the morning.”

03:50:05.289 --> 03:50:10.810
“I exercise in the morning.”

03:50:10.810 --> 03:50:12.119
The next one.

03:50:12.119 --> 03:50:15.069
“My lunchtime is at noon.”

03:50:15.069 --> 03:50:18.850
“My lunchtime is at noon.”

03:50:18.850 --> 03:50:21.529
The next one.

03:50:21.529 --> 03:50:25.350
“I like to go swimming in the afternoon.”

03:50:25.350 --> 03:50:30.020
“I like to go swimming in the afternoon.”

03:50:30.020 --> 03:50:34.049
And the next one.

03:50:34.049 --> 03:50:37.460
“I eat dinner in the evening.”

03:50:37.460 --> 03:50:42.279
“I eat dinner in the evening.”

03:50:42.279 --> 03:50:43.529
And the next one.

03:50:43.529 --> 03:50:46.659
“I eat ramyeon at midnight.”

03:50:46.659 --> 03:50:52.310
“I eat ramyeon at midnight.”

03:50:52.310 --> 03:50:53.550
And the last example.

03:50:53.550 --> 03:50:57.430
“Be careful walking alone at night.”

03:50:57.430 --> 03:51:01.119
“Be careful walking alone at night.”

03:51:01.119 --> 03:51:08.300
Ok, I hope you understand how to express the
different ‘times of day’ in English.

03:51:08.300 --> 03:51:11.529
Uhm…I’m going to ask you a question now.

03:51:11.529 --> 03:51:13.789
“When do you study English?”

03:51:13.789 --> 03:51:14.789
Ok…

03:51:14.789 --> 03:51:16.590
“What time of day do you study English?”

03:51:16.590 --> 03:51:18.959
“When do you study English?”

03:51:18.959 --> 03:51:25.670
Ahh…I..I suggest the best time to study
English is in the morning.

03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:27.119
Ok…ahh…

03:51:27.119 --> 03:51:29.169
In the afternoon is not so good.

03:51:29.169 --> 03:51:33.069
A lot of my students are always very tired
in the afternoon.

03:51:33.069 --> 03:51:34.359
In the evening is ok.

03:51:34.359 --> 03:51:36.299
But, never never at night.

03:51:36.299 --> 03:51:37.589
That’s too late.

03:51:37.589 --> 03:51:38.589
Alright…

03:51:38.589 --> 03:51:41.419
So, I hope you understand these time expression.

03:51:41.419 --> 03:51:44.609
See you next video.

03:51:44.609 --> 03:51:49.979
Hello, everyone.

03:51:49.979 --> 03:51:52.890
Welcome to this ‘time expressions’ video.

03:51:52.890 --> 03:52:01.119
In this video, we’re going to talk about
how to use ‘ago’, ‘late’, ‘next’

03:52:01.119 --> 03:52:02.119
and ‘last’.

03:52:02.119 --> 03:52:07.180
Ok, these are very useful expressions to use
when talking about time.

03:52:07.180 --> 03:52:08.579
But, first.

03:52:08.579 --> 03:52:12.010
Let’s review our vocabulary.

03:52:12.010 --> 03:52:16.520
And this is the vocabulary we need to know
for this video.

03:52:16.520 --> 03:52:17.779
Ahhh…’second’.

03:52:17.779 --> 03:52:19.289
And I have “one second.”

03:52:19.289 --> 03:52:21.199
Ok, “One second.

03:52:21.199 --> 03:52:25.109
We could also…instead of “one second”,
we could say, “a second”.

03:52:25.109 --> 03:52:27.699
So, ‘one’ and ‘a’, mean the same.

03:52:27.699 --> 03:52:29.329
Just one second.

03:52:29.329 --> 03:52:30.329
Ok…

03:52:30.329 --> 03:52:31.560
“One minute.”

03:52:31.560 --> 03:52:33.050
“A minute.”

03:52:33.050 --> 03:52:36.989
Ok…how many seconds in one minute?

03:52:36.989 --> 03:52:40.729
Well, sixty seconds in one minute.

03:52:40.729 --> 03:52:42.669
And the next is ‘hour’.

03:52:42.669 --> 03:52:45.800
Now ‘hour’ is special because we’re
going to use ‘an’.

03:52:45.800 --> 03:52:46.800
Ok…

03:52:46.800 --> 03:52:49.930
Because ‘hour’ starts with a vowel sound.

03:52:49.930 --> 03:52:50.930
Ok…

03:52:50.930 --> 03:52:51.930
“An hour.”

03:52:51.930 --> 03:52:54.850
Ok, we always use ‘an’ with ‘hour’.

03:52:54.850 --> 03:53:00.029
And of course, there’s sixty minutes in
one hour.

03:53:00.029 --> 03:53:02.420
“An hour.”

03:53:02.420 --> 03:53:03.869
Next is “a day”.

03:53:03.869 --> 03:53:05.060
“A day.”

03:53:05.060 --> 03:53:06.249
“One day.”

03:53:06.249 --> 03:53:09.470
Of course…how many hours in a day?

03:53:09.470 --> 03:53:10.470
Twenty-four hours.

03:53:10.470 --> 03:53:12.040
“A week.”

03:53:12.040 --> 03:53:13.879
How many days in a week?

03:53:13.879 --> 03:53:15.720
Seven days in a week.

03:53:15.720 --> 03:53:16.939
“One week.”

03:53:16.939 --> 03:53:18.169
“One month.”

03:53:18.169 --> 03:53:19.390
“A month.”

03:53:19.390 --> 03:53:20.390
Ok…

03:53:20.390 --> 03:53:21.390
And the last one.

03:53:21.390 --> 03:53:22.409
“One year.”

03:53:22.409 --> 03:53:23.699
“A year.”

03:53:23.699 --> 03:53:25.640
Ok, so that’s the vocabulary.

03:53:25.640 --> 03:53:27.470
I hope you understand.

03:53:27.470 --> 03:53:30.859
Uhh…before we move on, I’m going to change
this.

03:53:30.859 --> 03:53:33.039
Ok, this is one.

03:53:33.039 --> 03:53:37.979
But now, let’s put…let’s put two.

03:53:37.979 --> 03:53:39.749
Now everything changes.

03:53:39.749 --> 03:53:40.939
“Two second?”

03:53:40.939 --> 03:53:43.189
No, we have to plural it.

03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:44.770
“Two seconds.”

03:53:44.770 --> 03:53:46.350
“Two minute?”

03:53:46.350 --> 03:53:47.930
“Two minutes.”

03:53:47.930 --> 03:53:49.510
“Two hour?”

03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:50.510
No.

03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:51.879
“Two hours.”

03:53:51.879 --> 03:53:53.459
“Two day?”

03:53:53.459 --> 03:53:55.039
“Two days.”

03:53:55.039 --> 03:53:56.619
“Two week?”

03:53:56.619 --> 03:53:58.199
“Two weeks.”

03:53:58.199 --> 03:53:59.779
“Two months.”

03:53:59.779 --> 03:54:01.359
“Two years.”

03:54:01.359 --> 03:54:02.359
“Seconds.

03:54:02.359 --> 03:54:03.359
Minutes.

03:54:03.359 --> 03:54:04.359
Hours.

03:54:04.359 --> 03:54:05.359
Days.

03:54:05.359 --> 03:54:06.359
Weeks.

03:54:06.359 --> 03:54:07.359
Months.

03:54:07.359 --> 03:54:08.359
Years.”

03:54:08.359 --> 03:54:15.290
So, if you’re using ‘two’, ‘three’,
‘four’.. every number, except one.

03:54:15.290 --> 03:54:16.290
Ok…

03:54:16.290 --> 03:54:17.569
Make sure you use the plural.

03:54:17.569 --> 03:54:19.670
Alright, let’s move on.

03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:25.169
Ok, now we know the vocabulary let’s get
into the first two expressions.

03:54:25.169 --> 03:54:27.000
‘Ago’ and ‘later’.

03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:28.640
Very easy to use.

03:54:28.640 --> 03:54:33.029
‘Ago’ is talking about the past; before.

03:54:33.029 --> 03:54:36.419
And ‘later’ is talking about the future;
after.

03:54:36.419 --> 03:54:37.419
Ok…

03:54:37.419 --> 03:54:39.390
So, I have a question here.

03:54:39.390 --> 03:54:41.169
“When did you call me?”

03:54:41.169 --> 03:54:43.890
Ok, “When ‘did’ you call me?”

03:54:43.890 --> 03:54:46.069
Ok, this is talking about the past.

03:54:46.069 --> 03:54:49.209
So, someone asks, “When did you call me?”

03:54:49.209 --> 03:54:53.369
Ok…
wo…you just put the vocabulary here.

03:54:53.369 --> 03:54:54.640
“One second ago.”

03:54:54.640 --> 03:54:55.729
Ok, that’s very soon.

03:54:55.729 --> 03:54:56.729
That’s too soon.

03:54:56.729 --> 03:54:57.870
“When did you call me?”

03:54:57.870 --> 03:54:58.870
“One second ago.”

03:54:58.870 --> 03:55:00.369
That’s too soon.

03:55:00.369 --> 03:55:01.890
“One minute ago.”

03:55:01.890 --> 03:55:02.899
That’s possible.

03:55:02.899 --> 03:55:04.419
“One hour ago.”

03:55:04.419 --> 03:55:05.930
“One day ago.”

03:55:05.930 --> 03:55:07.449
“One week ago.”

03:55:07.449 --> 03:55:08.669
“One month ago.”

03:55:08.669 --> 03:55:09.669
“One year ago.”

03:55:09.669 --> 03:55:11.729
You can use any of these here.

03:55:11.729 --> 03:55:12.729
Ok…

03:55:12.729 --> 03:55:15.789
So, remember, if you said “five”.

03:55:15.789 --> 03:55:18.560
For example, ‘five’.

03:55:18.560 --> 03:55:20.729
“When did you call me?”

03:55:20.729 --> 03:55:22.359
“Five…minutes ago.”

03:55:22.359 --> 03:55:24.600
“Five minutes ago.”

03:55:24.600 --> 03:55:30.159
Ok, remember we have this ‘s’ because
it’s now ‘five’.

03:55:30.159 --> 03:55:31.399
“Five minutes ago.”

03:55:31.399 --> 03:55:35.339
Alright, so, we’re going to use ‘ago’
because it’s a past question.

03:55:35.339 --> 03:55:36.489
“When did you call me?”

03:55:36.489 --> 03:55:38.039
“Five minutes ago.”

03:55:38.039 --> 03:55:40.050
“When did you come home?”

03:55:40.050 --> 03:55:41.859
“One hour ago.”

03:55:41.859 --> 03:55:42.859
Alright…

03:55:42.859 --> 03:55:44.390
Let’s change the qu…question.

03:55:44.390 --> 03:55:47.069
Let’s change it here.

03:55:47.069 --> 03:55:49.489
To the future.

03:55:49.489 --> 03:55:52.579
“When will you call me?”

03:55:52.579 --> 03:55:54.189
Ok, in the future.

03:55:54.189 --> 03:55:55.709
“When will you call me?”

03:55:55.709 --> 03:55:59.079
Let’s talk…let’s use the future expression.

03:55:59.079 --> 03:56:00.079
Ahh…

03:56:00.079 --> 03:56:01.439
“One second later.”

03:56:01.439 --> 03:56:02.569
Well, that’s too soon.

03:56:02.569 --> 03:56:03.909
‘Second’ is a very short time.

03:56:03.909 --> 03:56:05.779
Ok, “When will you call me?”

03:56:05.779 --> 03:56:06.779
“One minute later.”

03:56:06.779 --> 03:56:08.630
“One hour later.”

03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:09.999
“One day later.”

03:56:09.999 --> 03:56:11.569
“One week later.”

03:56:11.569 --> 03:56:12.699
“One month later.”

03:56:12.699 --> 03:56:14.130
“One year later.”

03:56:14.130 --> 03:56:16.159
Very long time, ok…

03:56:16.159 --> 03:56:21.499
And, also remember…

03:56:21.499 --> 03:56:24.399
If we’re going to use a plural, ‘five’,
‘six’, ‘seven’, ‘eight’, we need

03:56:24.399 --> 03:56:25.399
the ‘s’.

03:56:25.399 --> 03:56:27.299
“When will you call me?”

03:56:27.299 --> 03:56:28.970
“Five hours later.”

03:56:28.970 --> 03:56:29.970
Alright…

03:56:29.970 --> 03:56:35.039
So, ‘ago’ and ‘later’ very useful
expressions to use for talking about the past

03:56:35.039 --> 03:56:36.189
and the future.

03:56:36.189 --> 03:56:38.250
Let’s move on to the next two expressions.

03:56:38.250 --> 03:56:41.560
Ok, so, we’re going to look at these two.

03:56:41.560 --> 03:56:43.329
‘Last’ and ‘next’.

03:56:43.329 --> 03:56:45.499
Also, very useful time expressions.

03:56:45.499 --> 03:56:48.789
Now, I changed the question a little bit.

03:56:48.789 --> 03:56:52.739
Ok, so, past tense, “When did you get married?”

03:56:52.739 --> 03:56:53.899
And for the future.

03:56:53.899 --> 03:56:55.499
“When will you get married?”

03:56:55.499 --> 03:56:56.800
Let’s take a look.

03:56:56.800 --> 03:56:59.489
“When did you get married?”

03:56:59.489 --> 03:57:01.909
“Last second?”

03:57:01.909 --> 03:57:03.129
No.

03:57:03.129 --> 03:57:07.229
We can’t use ‘second’ with this expression.

03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:08.479
“Next second?”

03:57:08.479 --> 03:57:09.479
No.

03:57:09.479 --> 03:57:10.479
“Last minute?”

03:57:10.479 --> 03:57:11.479
No.

03:57:11.479 --> 03:57:17.729
We can’t use ‘minute’ and actually,
we can’t use ‘hour’ and we can’t use

03:57:17.729 --> 03:57:18.729
‘day’.

03:57:18.729 --> 03:57:21.260
We can only use these expression.

03:57:21.260 --> 03:57:22.260
Ok…

03:57:22.260 --> 03:57:29.180
So, for these ones, you want to use ‘ago’
and ‘later’ only.

03:57:29.180 --> 03:57:34.890
Now these ones, you can use ‘ago’ and
‘later’ and ‘last’ and ‘next’.

03:57:34.890 --> 03:57:35.890
Ok…

03:57:35.890 --> 03:57:38.819
So, again, you can’t use these with ‘last’
and ‘next’.

03:57:38.819 --> 03:57:40.189
So, let’s take a look.

03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:42.039
“When did you get married?”

03:57:42.039 --> 03:57:43.859
“Last week.”

03:57:43.859 --> 03:57:45.680
“Last month.”

03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:47.509
“Last year.”

03:57:47.509 --> 03:57:48.509
Very easy.

03:57:48.509 --> 03:57:51.029
“When will you get married?”

03:57:51.029 --> 03:57:52.390
“Next week.”

03:57:52.390 --> 03:57:53.749
“Next month.”

03:57:53.749 --> 03:57:55.109
“Next year.”

03:57:55.109 --> 03:57:56.109
Ok…

03:57:56.109 --> 03:57:59.539
That’s how you use ‘last’ and ‘next’.

03:57:59.539 --> 03:58:00.539
Very easy.

03:58:00.539 --> 03:58:02.800
Let’s take a look at some examples.

03:58:02.800 --> 03:58:07.259
Alright, let’s look at some example sentences.

03:58:07.259 --> 03:58:08.310
Listen carefully.

03:58:08.310 --> 03:58:12.459
“Two weeks ago, I met a girl.”

03:58:12.459 --> 03:58:15.350
“Two weeks ago, I met a girl.”

03:58:15.350 --> 03:58:20.890
“Last week, we went on a date.”

03:58:20.890 --> 03:58:24.499
“Last week, we went on a date.”

03:58:24.499 --> 03:58:27.779
“Ten minutes ago, I asked her to marry me.”

03:58:27.779 --> 03:58:32.279
“Ten minutes ago, I asked her to marry me.”

03:58:32.279 --> 03:58:36.449
“Two hours later, we will go home.”

03:58:36.449 --> 03:58:40.899
“Two hours later, we will go home.”

03:58:40.899 --> 03:58:44.640
“Next week, we will meet her parents.”

03:58:44.640 --> 03:58:49.239
“Next week, we will meet her parents.”

03:58:49.239 --> 03:58:53.869
“Two months later, we will get married.”

03:58:53.869 --> 03:58:59.880
“Two months later, we will get married.”

03:58:59.880 --> 03:59:04.460
Ok, I hope you have a good understanding of
how to use the time expressions

03:59:04.460 --> 03:59:09.649
‘ago’ and ‘later’ and ‘last’ and
‘next’.

03:59:09.649 --> 03:59:13.299
They’re very useful to quickly express time.

03:59:13.299 --> 03:59:14.299
Alright…

03:59:14.299 --> 03:59:16.439
So, you should study those.

03:59:16.439 --> 03:59:17.439
Self-study.

03:59:17.439 --> 03:59:18.729
I know you can learn them.

03:59:18.729 --> 03:59:20.549
I know you can use them.

03:59:20.549 --> 03:59:21.549
So, uhh…

03:59:21.549 --> 03:59:23.579
I hope this video helped you.

03:59:23.579 --> 03:59:26.880
See you next time.

03:59:26.880 --> 03:59:32.459
Hello, everyone.

03:59:32.459 --> 03:59:35.129
Welcome to this ‘time expressions’ video.

03:59:35.129 --> 03:59:40.039
In this video, we’re going to talk about
‘time expressions’ for the ‘past’,

03:59:40.039 --> 03:59:42.189
‘present’ and ‘future’.

03:59:42.189 --> 03:59:48.129
Now in the previous video, the before video,
we already studied ‘ago’, ‘later’..uhh…’last’

03:59:48.129 --> 03:59:50.209
and ‘next’.

03:59:50.209 --> 03:59:52.390
Those ones are common.

03:59:52.390 --> 03:59:53.489
And here are a few more.

03:59:53.489 --> 03:59:54.489
Ok…

03:59:54.489 --> 04:00:00.199
Now, there’s a lot of time expressions and
I can’t teach them all, but I try to choose

04:00:00.199 --> 04:00:01.199
the most common.

04:00:01.199 --> 04:00:04.060
Alright, so let’s take a look.

04:00:04.060 --> 04:00:06.409
The first is the ‘past’.

04:00:06.409 --> 04:00:08.310
Things that happened before.

04:00:08.310 --> 04:00:11.680
And the first one, very common, “Last night”.

04:00:11.680 --> 04:00:12.789
Very easy to use.

04:00:12.789 --> 04:00:15.289
“Last night, I ate pizza.”

04:00:15.289 --> 04:00:17.970
“Last night, I drank a beer.”

04:00:17.970 --> 04:00:21.439
“Last night, I went to bed early.”

04:00:21.439 --> 04:00:26.289
Alright, so very easy to use to talk about
yesterday night.

04:00:26.289 --> 04:00:28.160
Now, the next three:

04:00:28.160 --> 04:00:33.380
“In the past”, “A long time ago,”
and “Long ago.”

04:00:33.380 --> 04:00:39.560
Ok, these are things that happened before,
but a very long time has passed.

04:00:39.560 --> 04:00:41.549
So, for example.

04:00:41.549 --> 04:00:44.489
“In the past, Korea had a war.”

04:00:44.489 --> 04:00:45.489
Ok…

04:00:45.489 --> 04:00:46.509
So, that was long ago.

04:00:46.509 --> 04:00:51.459
“A long time ago was the Chosun Dynasty.”

04:00:51.459 --> 04:00:54.829
Ok, “Long ago was the Chosun Dynasty.”

04:00:54.829 --> 04:01:00.649
All of these are good expressions to talk
about something long ago.

04:01:00.649 --> 04:01:04.029
Ok, let’s move on to the ‘present’.

04:01:04.029 --> 04:01:05.339
“Now.

04:01:05.339 --> 04:01:06.339
Right now.”

04:01:06.339 --> 04:01:10.090
“Right now, I’m teaching in this video.”

04:01:10.090 --> 04:01:12.770
Also, we could use this one.

04:01:12.770 --> 04:01:14.189
“As we speak.”

04:01:14.189 --> 04:01:17.739
“As we speak” means the same as “Now”.

04:01:17.739 --> 04:01:21.670
“As we speak, I am teaching this video.”

04:01:21.670 --> 04:01:25.499
“Nowadays,” “These days,” “Recently.”

04:01:25.499 --> 04:01:27.439
All of these mean the same thing.

04:01:27.439 --> 04:01:30.810
So something has happen around this time.

04:01:30.810 --> 04:01:33.449
Now, be careful with “Nowadays”.

04:01:33.449 --> 04:01:36.049
“Nowadays” is one word.

04:01:36.049 --> 04:01:38.850
A lot of my students say “Now days”.

04:01:38.850 --> 04:01:41.100
“Now days” is wrong.

04:01:41.100 --> 04:01:42.869
Don’t say “Now days”.

04:01:42.869 --> 04:01:44.649
You have to say, “Nowa…”

04:01:44.649 --> 04:01:48.100
, there’s an ‘a’ there, “Nowadays”.

04:01:48.100 --> 04:01:49.100
“Nowadays.”

04:01:49.100 --> 04:01:50.170
“These days.”

04:01:50.170 --> 04:01:51.170
“Recently.”

04:01:51.170 --> 04:01:53.999
So, “Nowadays, the weather is very hot.”

04:01:53.999 --> 04:01:54.999
Or…

04:01:54.999 --> 04:01:58.720
“These days, the economy is bad.”

04:01:58.720 --> 04:01:59.720
Alright…

04:01:59.720 --> 04:02:01.390
So all of theme…very similar.

04:02:01.390 --> 04:02:04.869
Alright, let’s go to the ‘future’.

04:02:04.869 --> 04:02:06.079
“Soon.”

04:02:06.079 --> 04:02:08.140
A lot of my students like to say, “coming
soon”.

04:02:08.140 --> 04:02:09.170
“Coming soon.”

04:02:09.170 --> 04:02:15.550
Now, we usually use “coming soon” for
movies that are coming soon.

04:02:15.550 --> 04:02:19.310
But, just when we’re talking with our friends…ahh…we
don’t usually say, “coming soon”.

04:02:19.310 --> 04:02:21.840
We say, “soon”.

04:02:21.840 --> 04:02:24.919
“My friend is coming soon.”

04:02:24.919 --> 04:02:26.029
That’s ok.

04:02:26.029 --> 04:02:28.810
But, “I’m getting married, soon.”

04:02:28.810 --> 04:02:30.930
Or…”I’m going to eat dinner, soon.”

04:02:30.930 --> 04:02:31.930
Ok…

04:02:31.930 --> 04:02:33.750
I’m going to use it like that.

04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:37.609
Don’t use “coming soon” too much.

04:02:37.609 --> 04:02:38.609
“Tonight.”

04:02:38.609 --> 04:02:41.669
“Tonight…I’m going to have a good dinner.”

04:02:41.669 --> 04:02:44.299
“Tonight, I’m going to go to bed early.”

04:02:44.299 --> 04:02:45.689
“Tomorrow night.”

04:02:45.689 --> 04:02:49.629
Ok, “Tomorrow night, I have to meet my friends.”

04:02:49.629 --> 04:02:52.680
“Tomorrow night, I’m going to exercise.”

04:02:52.680 --> 04:02:53.680
Alright…

04:02:53.680 --> 04:02:54.680
And the last two.

04:02:54.680 --> 04:02:57.659
“In the future,” “Far in the future.”

04:02:57.659 --> 04:02:58.659
Alright…

04:02:58.659 --> 04:03:00.289
So, we’re talking about a long time.

04:03:00.289 --> 04:03:05.409
So, “In the future.”…I don’t know
when, “In the future, I will get married.”

04:03:05.409 --> 04:03:08.749
“Far in the future.”

04:03:08.749 --> 04:03:13.330
“Far in the future, maybe twenty years,
later, I will retire.”

04:03:13.330 --> 04:03:14.750
I will quit my job.

04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:15.750
Alright…

04:03:15.750 --> 04:03:20.100
So, I’m sorry I had to go a little bit quick
through these expressions.

04:03:20.100 --> 04:03:25.989
These are good ‘time expressions’ to express
the ‘past’, ‘present’, and ‘future’.

04:03:25.989 --> 04:03:29.489
Let’s take a look at a few examples right
now.

04:03:29.489 --> 04:03:37.549
Ok, I wrote three sentences here to help you
understand how to use the ‘time expressions’

04:03:37.549 --> 04:03:39.799
‘past’, ‘present’, and ‘future’.

04:03:39.799 --> 04:03:42.079
Let’s take a look at the first one.

04:03:42.079 --> 04:03:43.850
“In the past, …”

04:03:43.850 --> 04:03:44.850
Ok…

04:03:44.850 --> 04:03:50.800
We should try and always use our ‘time expression’
at the beginning of the sentence.

04:03:50.800 --> 04:03:52.619
So, “In the past.”

04:03:52.619 --> 04:03:55.999
That’s my ‘time expression’

04:03:55.999 --> 04:04:00.090
After our ‘time expression’, we should
use a ‘comma’.

04:04:00.090 --> 04:04:03.699
“In the past,” comma.

04:04:03.699 --> 04:04:07.459
So, “In the past, Korea was poor.”

04:04:07.459 --> 04:04:10.470
“In the past, Korea was poor.”

04:04:10.470 --> 04:04:12.020
Alright…

04:04:12.020 --> 04:04:14.299
The economy was not good.

04:04:14.299 --> 04:04:17.159
Let’s look at the next sentence.

04:04:17.159 --> 04:04:18.609
“Nowadays,…” comma.

04:04:18.609 --> 04:04:20.069
So, “Nowadays…

04:04:20.069 --> 04:04:26.680
these days… recently, Korea is developing.”

04:04:26.680 --> 04:04:29.890
Ok, “Nowadays, Korea is developing.”

04:04:29.890 --> 04:04:31.759
Again, I have a ‘comma’.

04:04:31.759 --> 04:04:33.449
And let’s go to the future.

04:04:33.449 --> 04:04:37.419
“In the future, Korea will be rich.”

04:04:37.419 --> 04:04:41.939
“In the future, Korea will be in….will
be rich.”

04:04:41.939 --> 04:04:43.850
“In the future?”

04:04:43.850 --> 04:04:45.879
“Far in the future?”

04:04:45.879 --> 04:04:47.999
“Soon, maybe soon…”

04:04:47.999 --> 04:04:49.879
“Soon, Korea will be rich.”

04:04:49.879 --> 04:04:50.879
Ok…

04:04:50.879 --> 04:04:53.800
So, again, use the ‘time expressions’
in the beginning…

04:04:53.800 --> 04:04:55.749
followed by a comma there.

04:04:55.749 --> 04:04:56.749
Ok…

04:04:56.749 --> 04:05:00.420
So, let’s look at some more examples.

04:05:00.420 --> 04:05:01.420
Example one.

04:05:01.420 --> 04:05:03.799
“Last night, I had a job interview.”

04:05:03.799 --> 04:05:06.799
“Today, I got a phone call.

04:05:06.799 --> 04:05:07.799
I was hired.”

04:05:07.799 --> 04:05:12.579
“Tonight, I will celebrate at a good restaurant.”

04:05:12.579 --> 04:05:17.479
Ok, example number two.

04:05:17.479 --> 04:05:21.709
“In the past, children were very polite.”

04:05:21.709 --> 04:05:26.049
“Nowadays, children are rude.”

04:05:26.049 --> 04:05:30.870
“In the future, I hope children are polite
again.”

04:05:30.870 --> 04:05:34.829
Alright, next example.

04:05:34.829 --> 04:05:38.079
“Recently, I have been sick.

04:05:38.079 --> 04:05:41.609
“As we speak, my stomach hurts.”

04:05:41.609 --> 04:05:45.920
“Soon, I may need to go to the hospital.”

04:05:45.920 --> 04:05:49.699
Alright, the last example.

04:05:49.699 --> 04:05:52.589
“A long time ago, I got married.”

04:05:52.589 --> 04:05:57.039
“These days, I have two teenage boys.”

04:05:57.039 --> 04:06:02.000
“Far in the future, I will have grandchildren.”

04:06:02.000 --> 04:06:07.560
Ok, so those were some good examples of how
to use the ‘time expressions’ of ‘past’,

04:06:07.560 --> 04:06:09.239
‘present’ and ‘future’.

04:06:09.239 --> 04:06:14.810
Now, as I taught you, you try and use the
‘time expressions’ at the beginning of

04:06:14.810 --> 04:06:16.109
the sentence.

04:06:16.109 --> 04:06:20.339
But, in some cases, it is ok to use them at
the end.

04:06:20.339 --> 04:06:22.770
Alright, that’s…that’s not a bad thing.

04:06:22.770 --> 04:06:24.669
Anyway, I hope you understand.

04:06:24.669 --> 04:06:28.090
I know there’s a lot to learn in this video.

04:06:28.090 --> 04:06:32.709
I hope to see you again, soon.

04:06:32.709 --> 04:06:38.430
+++++
Hello, everyone.

04:06:38.430 --> 04:06:41.430
Welcome to this ‘time expressions’ video.

04:06:41.430 --> 04:06:47.130
In this video, we are going to talk about
‘indefinite adverbs of frequency’.

04:06:47.130 --> 04:06:51.289
Ok, what are ‘indefinite adverbs of frequency’?

04:06:51.289 --> 04:06:56.409
Well, ‘indefinite’ means the time is not
exact.

04:06:56.409 --> 04:06:58.209
Not detailed.

04:06:58.209 --> 04:07:05.029
And ‘adverbs of frequncy’, are words that
describe ‘how often’ we do something.

04:07:05.029 --> 04:07:06.029
Ok…

04:07:06.029 --> 04:07:11.720
So, to help you understand, let’s look at
the list of adverbs of frequency.

04:07:11.720 --> 04:07:13.409
These are the most common.

04:07:13.409 --> 04:07:16.869
Alright, so ‘how often you do something’.

04:07:16.869 --> 04:07:18.279
Let’s go through the list.

04:07:18.279 --> 04:07:21.039
Of course, the top one is “always”.

04:07:21.039 --> 04:07:24.720
That means you ‘aways’ do something.

04:07:24.720 --> 04:07:26.699
“Almost always.”

04:07:26.699 --> 04:07:28.020
Very close.

04:07:28.020 --> 04:07:29.020
“Frequently.”

04:07:29.020 --> 04:07:31.369
Ok, you do it a lot.

04:07:31.369 --> 04:07:32.430
“Usually.”

04:07:32.430 --> 04:07:33.479
“Often.”

04:07:33.479 --> 04:07:34.529
“Sometimes.”

04:07:34.529 --> 04:07:37.210
Ok, ‘sometimes’ is the middle.

04:07:37.210 --> 04:07:39.219
So, sometimes you do something.

04:07:39.219 --> 04:07:40.709
Sometimes, you don’t.

04:07:40.709 --> 04:07:41.709
“Occasionally.”

04:07:41.709 --> 04:07:42.709
“Occasionally.”

04:07:42.709 --> 04:07:43.709
“Seldom.”

04:07:43.709 --> 04:07:44.709
“Rarely.”

04:07:44.709 --> 04:07:49.969
Ok, you don’t do something very much.

04:07:49.969 --> 04:07:51.989
“Almost never.”

04:07:51.989 --> 04:07:53.600
And the last one, “Never”.

04:07:53.600 --> 04:07:55.430
You ‘never’ do something.

04:07:55.430 --> 04:07:57.949
Ok, so let’s look at our question.

04:07:57.949 --> 04:08:01.749
This is the important question we want to
answer.

04:08:01.749 --> 04:08:04.789
“How often…how often do you…?”

04:08:04.789 --> 04:08:07.909
So, “How often do you…” do something.

04:08:07.909 --> 04:08:10.969
So, let’s make an example question.

04:08:10.969 --> 04:08:13.919
“How often do you drink water?”

04:08:13.919 --> 04:08:17.100
Ok, “How often do you drink water?”

04:08:17.100 --> 04:08:20.329
So, someone asks you that question.

04:08:20.329 --> 04:08:22.180
“How often do you drink water?”

04:08:22.180 --> 04:08:28.749
Ok, so first, you should think about which
one of these describes how often you drink

04:08:28.749 --> 04:08:29.749
water.

04:08:29.749 --> 04:08:34.180
So, there’s actually three ways to answer
this question.

04:08:34.180 --> 04:08:37.310
Now, I’m going to choose ‘always’.

04:08:37.310 --> 04:08:44.260
So, the first way to answer, “How often
do you drink water?”, I would say, “Always”.

04:08:44.260 --> 04:08:45.659
Ok, very simple.

04:08:45.659 --> 04:08:48.049
You just say the ‘adverb of frequency’.

04:08:48.049 --> 04:08:49.609
“How often do you drink water?”

04:08:49.609 --> 04:08:50.609
“Always.”

04:08:50.609 --> 04:08:52.879
Ok, that’s the easiest way.

04:08:52.879 --> 04:08:54.109
The second way.

04:08:54.109 --> 04:08:56.600
“How often do you drink water?”

04:08:56.600 --> 04:08:59.539
Ok, you would use a complete sentence.

04:08:59.539 --> 04:09:01.749
A full sentence.

04:09:01.749 --> 04:09:04.509
“I always drink water.”

04:09:04.509 --> 04:09:07.039
“How often do you drink water?”

04:09:07.039 --> 04:09:09.419
“I always drink water.”

04:09:09.419 --> 04:09:10.770
Alright…

04:09:10.770 --> 04:09:15.959
And the last way, which is probably the most
common way, is this one here.

04:09:15.959 --> 04:09:19.079
“How often do you drink water?”

04:09:19.079 --> 04:09:20.999
“I always do.”

04:09:20.999 --> 04:09:21.999
Ok…

04:09:21.999 --> 04:09:22.999
“I always do.”

04:09:22.999 --> 04:09:25.109
This is a good sentence to use.

04:09:25.109 --> 04:09:28.459
Alright, let’s change the question.

04:09:28.459 --> 04:09:32.189
“How often do you drink soju?”

04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:35.709
Ok, “How often do you drink soju?”

04:09:35.709 --> 04:09:36.709
uhh…

04:09:36.709 --> 04:09:39.109
some of you are ‘always’.

04:09:39.109 --> 04:09:40.739
Some of you are ‘never’.

04:09:40.739 --> 04:09:43.310
I’m going to choose ‘sometimes’.

04:09:43.310 --> 04:09:46.239
So, I’m going to say, “I sometimes do.”

04:09:46.239 --> 04:09:48.859
“How often do you drink soju?”

04:09:48.859 --> 04:09:50.209
“I sometimes do.”

04:09:50.209 --> 04:09:51.359
Alright…

04:09:51.359 --> 04:09:58.839
Now, the ‘adverbs of frequency’ are usually
in the middle of the sentence.

04:09:58.839 --> 04:09:59.839
Ok…

04:09:59.839 --> 04:10:03.270
But, you see these ones here with the star…

04:10:03.270 --> 04:10:09.939
These ones are in the middle, but also, we
could use them at the beginning of a sentence.

04:10:09.939 --> 04:10:12.909
So, “How often do you drink soju?”

04:10:12.909 --> 04:10:15.260
“Sometimes, I do.”

04:10:15.260 --> 04:10:16.999
“I sometimes do.”

04:10:16.999 --> 04:10:19.619
Both ways are ok.

04:10:19.619 --> 04:10:20.689
Alright…

04:10:20.689 --> 04:10:22.909
So these are the ‘adverbs of frequency’.

04:10:22.909 --> 04:10:27.939
I know it takes a lot of practice to remember
them and use them properly.

04:10:27.939 --> 04:10:33.569
So, we’re going to look at a few more examples
right now to help you understand them.

04:10:33.569 --> 04:10:37.390
Ok, let’s look at some example sentences.

04:10:37.390 --> 04:10:38.859
The first one.

04:10:38.859 --> 04:10:43.219
“Occasionally, I play tennis.”

04:10:43.219 --> 04:10:47.579
“Occasionally, I play tennis.”

04:10:47.579 --> 04:10:51.719
“I frequently swim at the beach.”

04:10:51.719 --> 04:10:57.729
“I frequently swim at the beach.”

04:10:57.729 --> 04:10:59.499
“Sometimes, I go fishing.”

04:10:59.499 --> 04:11:02.739
“Sometimes, I go fishing.”

04:11:02.739 --> 04:11:06.709
“I always have a headache.”

04:11:06.709 --> 04:11:10.579
“I always have a headache.”

04:11:10.579 --> 04:11:15.249
“My wife usually comes home late.”

04:11:15.249 --> 04:11:20.999
“My wife usually comes home late.”

04:11:20.999 --> 04:11:24.739
“She almost never studies.”

04:11:24.739 --> 04:11:29.069
“She almost never studies.”

04:11:29.069 --> 04:11:34.369
“We hardly ever hold hands.”

04:11:34.369 --> 04:11:39.319
“We hardly ever hold hands.”

04:11:39.319 --> 04:11:41.709
“They often fight.”

04:11:41.709 --> 04:11:45.119
“They often fight.”

04:11:45.119 --> 04:11:52.949
Alright, so those were some good examples
of how to use ‘indefinite adverbs of frequency’.

04:11:52.949 --> 04:11:57.719
Now, they’re very useful to know, so you
should study them.

04:11:57.719 --> 04:12:04.609
Now, I couldn’t talk about everything in
this video, so you need some extra self-study.

04:12:04.609 --> 04:12:05.710
Learn them.

04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:06.710
Use them.

04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:10.949
They’re very useful to express how often
you do something.

04:12:10.949 --> 04:12:13.439
Alright, so that’s it for this video.

04:12:13.439 --> 04:12:16.699
See you next video.

04:12:16.699 --> 04:12:22.080
Hello, everyone.

04:12:22.080 --> 04:12:24.760
Welcome to this ‘time expression’ video.

04:12:24.760 --> 04:12:31.129
In this video we are going to learn how to
use ‘definite adverbs of frequency’.

04:12:31.129 --> 04:12:32.409
What does that mean?

04:12:32.409 --> 04:12:35.569
Well, ‘definite’ means an exact time.

04:12:35.569 --> 04:12:37.850
An exact amount.

04:12:37.850 --> 04:12:45.119
And the ‘adverbs of frequency’…ok, those
are words to describe how often we do something.

04:12:45.119 --> 04:12:47.239
Alright, so let’s take a look.

04:12:47.239 --> 04:12:50.109
This is the question we want to answer.

04:12:50.109 --> 04:12:54.999
So someone asks, “How often do you…?,
do something.

04:12:54.999 --> 04:12:57.259
So, let’s do an example.

04:12:57.259 --> 04:13:01.560
I will ask, “How often do you take a shower?”

04:13:01.560 --> 04:13:04.140
“How often do you take a shower?”

04:13:04.140 --> 04:13:06.710
Ok, so we have to answer.

04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:09.759
Now, let’s start with ‘once’.

04:13:09.759 --> 04:13:11.729
‘Once’ means ‘one time’.

04:13:11.729 --> 04:13:15.879
But, we don’t say ‘one time’, we use
the word ‘once’.

04:13:15.879 --> 04:13:19.520
So, “How often do you take a shower?”

04:13:19.520 --> 04:13:22.659
“Once…” and then I would choose one
of these.

04:13:22.659 --> 04:13:23.659
Ok…

04:13:23.659 --> 04:13:24.659
“Once a minute.”

04:13:24.659 --> 04:13:26.869
Ok, that’s a lot of showers.

04:13:26.869 --> 04:13:28.399
“Once an hour.”

04:13:28.399 --> 04:13:31.010
That’s still a lot of showers.

04:13:31.010 --> 04:13:32.609
“Once a day.”

04:13:32.609 --> 04:13:33.649
That sounds right.

04:13:33.649 --> 04:13:35.909
“How often do you take a shower?”

04:13:35.909 --> 04:13:38.379
“Once a day.”

04:13:38.379 --> 04:13:39.509
Alright…

04:13:39.509 --> 04:13:45.959
Now some of you, maybe you take a shower ‘two
times’, but we don’t say ‘two times’,

04:13:45.959 --> 04:13:47.579
we say ‘twice’.

04:13:47.579 --> 04:13:51.239
Ok, so we use ‘once’, ‘twice’.

04:13:51.239 --> 04:13:53.879
“How often do you take a shower?”

04:13:53.879 --> 04:13:56.270
“Twice a day.”

04:13:56.270 --> 04:13:57.270
Ok…

04:13:57.270 --> 04:14:03.249
And if you’re a very dirty person, maybe
“twice a week”, “twice a month”, or

04:14:03.249 --> 04:14:04.709
“once a year”.

04:14:04.709 --> 04:14:07.100
That’s a very dirty person.

04:14:07.100 --> 04:14:12.829
Ok, so we have ‘once’, ‘twice’, uhhh…I’ll
change the question.

04:14:12.829 --> 04:14:16.369
“How often do you brush your teeth?”

04:14:16.369 --> 04:14:18.979
“How often do you brush your teeth?”

04:14:18.979 --> 04:14:22.499
Well, I brush my teeth…let’s see…

04:14:22.499 --> 04:14:24.259
“Once…. a day?”

04:14:24.259 --> 04:14:25.259
No.

04:14:25.259 --> 04:14:26.259
No.

04:14:26.259 --> 04:14:27.259
“Twice…”

04:14:27.259 --> 04:14:28.939
No, I’ll say, “Three times…”

04:14:28.939 --> 04:14:29.939
Ok…

04:14:29.939 --> 04:14:32.729
So we say, ‘once’, ‘twice’, ‘three
times’.

04:14:32.729 --> 04:14:37.989
“I brush my teeth three times a day.”

04:14:37.989 --> 04:14:40.189
“Three times a day.”

04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:43.609
Uhh…”How often do you eat food?”

04:14:43.609 --> 04:14:49.249
Hmmm, “I eat food…three times…four times…many
times.”

04:14:49.249 --> 04:14:53.819
Ok, I eat a lot of food.

04:14:53.819 --> 04:15:01.499
I eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and some snacks,
so, “many times a day.”

04:15:01.499 --> 04:15:02.499
Alright…

04:15:02.499 --> 04:15:05.100
Ok, so that’s…we’re using ‘a day’
a lot.

04:15:05.100 --> 04:15:06.299
Let’s use one of these.

04:15:06.299 --> 04:15:08.899
“How often do you go to school?”

04:15:08.899 --> 04:15:14.850
Ok, so if I ask the questions, “How often
do you go to school?”, well…”three times…”,

04:15:14.850 --> 04:15:18.909
uhhh… if you go to school maybe ‘five
times’ a week.

04:15:18.909 --> 04:15:21.649
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

04:15:21.649 --> 04:15:26.430
So, you would say, “Five times a week.”

04:15:26.430 --> 04:15:27.430
Ok…

04:15:27.430 --> 04:15:30.520
“How often do you take a trip?”

04:15:30.520 --> 04:15:31.520
Ok…

04:15:31.520 --> 04:15:33.949
“How often do you take a trip?”

04:15:33.949 --> 04:15:39.249
Well, maybe you would say, “Once a year.”

04:15:39.249 --> 04:15:41.279
“Once a year.”

04:15:41.279 --> 04:15:43.989
Maybe, “Twice a year.”

04:15:43.989 --> 04:15:44.989
Ok…

04:15:44.989 --> 04:15:46.020
Ahh…maybe “never”.

04:15:46.020 --> 04:15:50.159
Ok, don’t forget ‘never’ is also a choice.

04:15:50.159 --> 04:15:54.949
Alright, so this is how we use the ‘definite
adverbs of frequency’.

04:15:54.949 --> 04:15:56.689
Let’s move on to some more.

04:15:56.689 --> 04:16:00.060
Ok, we’re going to look at the expression
‘every’.

04:16:00.060 --> 04:16:02.799
‘Every’ is very common.

04:16:02.799 --> 04:16:03.949
Very easy to use.

04:16:03.949 --> 04:16:06.489
Cause you can say, “Every morning.

04:16:06.489 --> 04:16:08.289
Every afternoon.

04:16:08.289 --> 04:16:09.729
Every evening.

04:16:09.729 --> 04:16:10.829
Every minute.

04:16:10.829 --> 04:16:12.209
Every hour.

04:16:12.209 --> 04:16:13.209
Every day.

04:16:13.209 --> 04:16:14.359
Every week.

04:16:14.359 --> 04:16:15.359
Every month.

04:16:15.359 --> 04:16:16.359
Every year.”

04:16:16.359 --> 04:16:18.939
So, let’s make a new question.

04:16:18.939 --> 04:16:21.810
“How often do you exercise?”

04:16:21.810 --> 04:16:23.619
“How often do you exercise?”

04:16:23.619 --> 04:16:28.149
Well, some of you maybe “every morning”
or “every evening’.

04:16:28.149 --> 04:16:29.419
“Every day.”

04:16:29.419 --> 04:16:30.419
Alright…

04:16:30.419 --> 04:16:35.939
Ahhh, “How often do you check your phone
for new messages?”

04:16:35.939 --> 04:16:41.159
Ok, so, “How often do you check your phone
for new messages?”

04:16:41.159 --> 04:16:43.589
Some of you might say, “Every minute”.

04:16:43.589 --> 04:16:45.649
“Every minute I check my phone.”

04:16:45.649 --> 04:16:48.359
Or “every hour.”

04:16:48.359 --> 04:16:52.089
“How often do you visit your grandparents?”

04:16:52.089 --> 04:16:53.219
Ok…

04:16:53.219 --> 04:16:58.159
Maybe your grandparents live very far, “How
often do you visit your grandparents?”

04:16:58.159 --> 04:17:00.380
Well, “every year”.

04:17:00.380 --> 04:17:01.380
Ok…

04:17:01.380 --> 04:17:04.859
So, that’s similar to “once a year”.

04:17:04.859 --> 04:17:06.199
“Every year.”

04:17:06.199 --> 04:17:08.289
Alright, so that’s ‘every’.

04:17:08.289 --> 04:17:09.659
Very easy to use.

04:17:09.659 --> 04:17:10.659
Very common.

04:17:10.659 --> 04:17:15.079
So, let’s look at some more examples right
now.

04:17:15.079 --> 04:17:16.239
The first example.

04:17:16.239 --> 04:17:20.359
“I visit my parents once a month.”

04:17:20.359 --> 04:17:24.499
“I visit my parents once a month.”

04:17:24.499 --> 04:17:27.589
The next example.

04:17:27.589 --> 04:17:32.339
“Five times a week, I go jogging.”

04:17:32.339 --> 04:17:37.119
“Five times a week, I go jogging.”

04:17:37.119 --> 04:17:38.669
The next example.

04:17:38.669 --> 04:17:42.489
“Every minute, I check my mirror.”

04:17:42.489 --> 04:17:49.130
“Every minute, I check my mirror.”

04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:52.529
“Every evening, I watch TV.”

04:17:52.529 --> 04:17:59.020
“Every evening, I watch TV.”

04:17:59.020 --> 04:18:00.600
And the last example.

04:18:00.600 --> 04:18:05.589
“I like to meet my friends, once a week.”

04:18:05.589 --> 04:18:10.590
“I like to meet my friends, once a week.”

04:18:10.590 --> 04:18:17.729
Ok, we just saw some great examples of how
to use ‘definite adverbs of frequency’.

04:18:17.729 --> 04:18:19.749
They’re very good to know.

04:18:19.749 --> 04:18:24.279
Especially when someone is asking you a “How
often…” question.

04:18:24.279 --> 04:18:27.569
Alright, you have to answer with an adverb
of frequency.

04:18:27.569 --> 04:18:30.439
So, you need to do a little more self-study.

04:18:30.439 --> 04:18:37.289
I couldn’t talk about everything in this
video, so please do a little more self-study

04:18:37.289 --> 04:18:38.959
and learn them very well.

04:18:38.959 --> 04:18:40.949
I know you can master them.

04:18:40.949 --> 04:18:43.069
That’s it for this video.

04:18:43.069 --> 04:18:43.519
See you next time.
