00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.600
Do you want to make a big improvement in your&nbsp;
English? One of the best ways to do that is by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.200
mastering English tenses. This means understanding&nbsp;
the difference between saying "I work" or "I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.680
working", "I have worked", or "I had worked", and&nbsp;
so on. Tenses tell us when something happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.760
and whenever you communicate in English, you're&nbsp;
using an English tense. The only question is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.960
are you using the right tense?
In this series, you will learn all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.280
of the English tenses. These are full, complete&nbsp;
classes for anyone who wants to speak, write, or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.840
understand English more easily and clearly. With&nbsp;
each tense, we will go step by step from beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.960
to end. We'll also go through the program from&nbsp;
beginner level to the advanced level of tenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.560
And we'll do lots of practice along the way.
In addition, I will show you a special way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:12.240
understand these tenses, so you can really start&nbsp;
to use them more easily and quickly. Remember,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.440
tenses give structure to the language. If your&nbsp;
structure is weak, your English will be weak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.120
But if your structure is strong,&nbsp;
your English will be strong.
&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.320
So, join me in this program to master the&nbsp;
English tenses so that you can communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.720
fluently and confidently in English.
Hi, I'm Rebecca, and welcome to this series on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.600
English tenses. In this program, you will learn&nbsp;
how to use each of the English tenses, step by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.400
step, so that you can communicate more powerfully&nbsp;
and correctly and confidently in English.
&nbsp;

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.600
Now, when we say English tenses, what does that&nbsp;
mean? Tenses are simply the way we talk about time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.800
in any language. So, for example, when we want to&nbsp;
say when something happened, we're using tenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.160
If we're talking about the past, the present, or&nbsp;
the future, we need to use tenses. And in English,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.720
there are twelve tenses. Don't let that frighten&nbsp;
you. I'm going to explain it to you in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.880
makes it much easier for you to understand and&nbsp;
start to use each of these tenses. And that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.200
how you will progress in your English. Okay?
So, first, I've divided the tenses into six basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.200
tenses and six advanced tenses. And I'm going to&nbsp;
show you exactly the kind of patterns that exist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.920
throughout this tense system, so that as you&nbsp;
go forward, many parts of it will become easier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.840
and easier. Okay? Alright. That's first of all.
Now, in terms of what are these lessons actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.800
like? In terms of the content - these are not&nbsp;
short lessons. These are full, complete classes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.640
on each tense. Alright? Just as if - if you&nbsp;
were in a language school in North America&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.960
or England or Australia. That's the kind of&nbsp;
class it'll be. A solid class on each tense.
&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.280
So, in these classes, I will explain, for each&nbsp;
tense, when to use it and how to use it. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.840
will do lots of practice so that you really feel&nbsp;
comfortable using that tense correctly in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.400
the grammar, in terms of when to use it. And also,&nbsp;
we'll look at some common mistakes that students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.520
often make so that you don't make those mistakes.&nbsp;
I've also created some bonus lessons where we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.680
compare different tenses. Because sometimes the&nbsp;
confusion is not within the tense but between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.240
tenses. So, I've got some comparison lessons that&nbsp;
will help you understand the differences. Okay?
&nbsp;

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:08.000
Next - so, how could you do this course?&nbsp;
Here are my suggestions. First, make a plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.240
alright? Make a schedule for yourself.&nbsp;
When are you going to watch them? And then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.120
like any school, show up for class. Really, it's&nbsp;
not just about wishing that you get better, or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.120
hoping that you get better in English. It's about&nbsp;
making a decision and then taking the actions. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.200
you've already made the decision, because&nbsp;
you're watching this, and that's amazing. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.280
make the plan so you can take the action steps you&nbsp;
need to reach your goal. Okay? That's first.
&nbsp;

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.080
Next - watch the lesson. Alright? Take&nbsp;
your time with it. Don't rush through it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.520
even if some part seems easy, watch it&nbsp;
anyway. Let your brain get really comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.720
and completely knowledgeable in that area,&nbsp;
okay? And while you're watching, participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.200
What does that mean? Be an active learner.&nbsp;
Make notes. Go get a special notebook,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.880
a special binder, just for this course, this&nbsp;
program, alright? Take notes as you go along.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.400
Participate and repeat after me when I'm - when&nbsp;
we're doing the pronunciation sections. Answer me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.280
when I'm asking questions, work on the exercises&nbsp;
with me so that you are fully engaged and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:32.000
learning fully throughout that time, alright?
Next - review. Whenever you have time or during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.120
the week or something like that, between your&nbsp;
classes, review what you've learned. Go back - if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.200
there's any particular part you're not sure&nbsp;
about, go back over it and just learn it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.280
Review it so that you'll feel really sure as you&nbsp;
go forward into the other tenses. And it will make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.520
everything so much easier for you, okay?
I know that this program will work for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.400
Just stay with it and show up and keep going&nbsp;
through it, step by step, and I know that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.480
will lead you to a higher level of English. How&nbsp;
do I know that? Let me take just a few seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.840
to tell you a little bit about myself. My&nbsp;
name's Rebecca Ezekiel. I've been teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.200
English for more than 30 years, and I've worked&nbsp;
with thousands of students from all over the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.920
to help them improve their English for&nbsp;
academic purposes, business purposes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.360
and all kinds of other reasons. Alright?&nbsp;
I've also created lots of training programs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.640
for corporations and governments and schools and&nbsp;
colleges. So, I assure you, you're in good hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.480
I understand you. I understand your challenges,&nbsp;
but also your hopes and dreams in improving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.400
your English to really expand your life.
So, let's go on this journey together and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.920
most important, let's get started!
In this video, I'm going to give you an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.560
overview of all of the English tenses. And I'm&nbsp;
going to show you a special way to understand them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.640
so that you can learn them more easily. So, this&nbsp;
video is part of the www.engvid.com series on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.400
English verb tenses.
But what are tenses anyway?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:16.000
Tenses are just the way we refer to time in a&nbsp;
language. We could be talking about the past or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.880
the present or the future. In English, there&nbsp;
are twelve different tenses, and they can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.720
explained in many different ways, but I'm going&nbsp;
to show you a simple way that I think will make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.200
it much easier for you to learn, understand,&nbsp;
and start using them. So, let's have a look.
&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:44.480
So, on the board, I've written the twelve tenses.&nbsp;
In red are the names of the tenses, and in black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.920
is an example each time of that tense. Alright?&nbsp;
But right now, you don't have to worry about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.120
This is just to give you the big picture,&nbsp;
alright? But don't worry if you don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.360
the names of these tenses or the examples. It&nbsp;
doesn't matter at all. Once we begin the program,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.400
you will be learning one tense at a time&nbsp;
and you'll learn everything you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.480
know when you get to that tense. Alright?
So, what do we need to see here, though, that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:21.440
helpful to us? So, even though there are twelve&nbsp;
tenses, I've divided them in a particular way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:30.000
The first six are what I call the basic tenses.&nbsp;
Because usually, these are the ones you learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.440
first when you start learning English. The&nbsp;
second part, the second six tenses are more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.080
advanced tenses. Usually, you start learning those&nbsp;
a little bit later. That's the first part.
&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:55.280
Now, let's look at it this way. On this side,&nbsp;
we see simple tenses. On this side, we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.840
continuous tenses, which are sometimes called&nbsp;
progressive tenses. But all those names, simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.360
continuous, doesn't matter right now. Because&nbsp;
when you get to that tense, you'll understand it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.760
What is important, though, is that many of&nbsp;
the patterns and rules that you'll learn here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:22.160
will help you throughout this part of the tenses.&nbsp;
And many of the rules and patterns about grammar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:28.880
pronunciation, and spelling that you learn right&nbsp;
here with this continuous tense will help you all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.640
the way through to the most advanced tense.
What does that mean for you? It means that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.560
as you go forward in this program, from the&nbsp;
beginner tenses and the more basic tenses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.280
to the more advanced tenses. It's not -&nbsp;
everything is not going to get harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.960
Many of the points will actually become easier,&nbsp;
because you will already have learned them up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.840
here in the basic tenses, or here, because many of&nbsp;
these, as you can see - actually all of them have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:04.240
some sort of continuous aspect, which you will&nbsp;
understand completely when you get there. Okay?
&nbsp;

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.240
So, that's the most important points that I think&nbsp;
you should take away right now from this. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:17.520
you need to do at this point now is to begin the&nbsp;
program with the first tense, which is the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:24.160
simple tense. So I wish you all the best.
Hi, I'm Rebecca. Welcome to this series on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:32.560
English tenses. In this class, we will look at the&nbsp;
present simple tense. I'll show you exactly when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:39.360
to use it, how to use it, and also what mistakes&nbsp;
to be careful of when you're using this tense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:46.080
We'll also go through lots of practice exercises&nbsp;
together, so you'll learn exactly how to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.160
this tense correctly and confidently.&nbsp;
Are you ready? Let's get started.
&nbsp;

00:10:52.720 --> 00:11:00.160
This series is about English tenses. But what&nbsp;
are tenses anyway? Tenses are simply the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:09.600
we talk about time in English. What do we mean by&nbsp;
time? We mean the past, the present, the future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:17.120
right? These are all different times and we have&nbsp;
different tenses to express or talk about those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:26.000
times. So, in this lesson, we're going to&nbsp;
look at the two basic ways that you - we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.200
speak about the present in English and they are:&nbsp;
the present simple and the present continuous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:39.280
or present progressive as it's also called.
Now, although we are focusing on the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.200
simple, I want to give you a little&nbsp;
overview so you understand the basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:52.080
differences between these two simple tenses,&nbsp;
alright? So, let me give you an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:03.680
In present simple, we would say "I work". And in&nbsp;
present continuous, we would say "I am working".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.400
So, what's the difference? What's the&nbsp;
difference between these two sentences?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.480
What's the difference, is there a difference?&nbsp;
I don't know, what do you think? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:25.040
I do know. And there is a difference. Perhaps, in&nbsp;
your language, there isn't any difference because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:33.280
in many languages, there is no difference between&nbsp;
the way that these two ideas are expressed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.960
but in English, there is a difference in&nbsp;
the idea and the way that we say it.
&nbsp;

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.440
So, let me explain what that difference is. When&nbsp;
we say "I am working", which is that other tense,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:52.480
present continuous, which we can learn later, that&nbsp;
is talking about something that is happening now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:03.120
or something temporary. What do I mean by now?&nbsp;
For example, I am teaching. You are listening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:09.280
right? All these things are happening right now.&nbsp;
So, when we are saying that, when I'm saying that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:17.600
I'm using present continuous. But when&nbsp;
I say "I work", that is in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:24.960
For example, I may not be working at this&nbsp;
moment, but I work somewhere. I have a job. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:31.200
when we talk about something that's true&nbsp;
in general, that's present simple. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.280
present simple is for something that's more or&nbsp;
less permanent. For example, if you have a job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:46.080
of course, no job or thing in life is necessarily&nbsp;
permanent. What does permanent mean, that it lasts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.040
all the time, but let's say you're not&nbsp;
changing jobs every day. So, more or less,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:59.360
this is the job you'll always have. This is&nbsp;
your permanent job. So then, for those kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:07.280
of activities, we use present simple and we say&nbsp;
"I work at the bank". "I work in the store" etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:16.560
But, "I am working" would just be right now, or it&nbsp;
could also be for something temporary. "Temporary"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:23.360
means only for a short period of time. This is&nbsp;
for always, this is for a short period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.880
This is true in general, and this one&nbsp;
is true for something happening now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.800
So, those are some basic differences&nbsp;
between these two tenses.
&nbsp;

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:42.480
Now, let's focus on the tense that we're&nbsp;
working on today, which is present simple. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:49.040
how does it sound? How does it actually work? It's&nbsp;
like this - so these are the different subjects,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:59.280
and this is the verb and the way we use it.&nbsp;
So just repeat it after me: I work. You work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:18.560
We work. They work. He works. She works. And:&nbsp;
It works. "It" meaning the air conditioner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.760
or the computer. "It" is for something which&nbsp;
is not a person but it's for a thing.
&nbsp;

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.360
And we saw some differences there.&nbsp;
Don't worry about those changes now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.040
We're going to learn all about&nbsp;
that in a later part of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:41.840
lesson, okay? So that's what it sounds like. This&nbsp;
is a basic description of these two differences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.120
which you can keep in mind as we now move&nbsp;
forward with the present simple tense.
&nbsp;

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:54.160
Now, let's look at when we use the&nbsp;
present simple tense, okay? So, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.400
five different situations in which we can use&nbsp;
this tense. Let's go through them one by one.
&nbsp;

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.200
First of all, we can use the present simple tense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:13.520
to talk about things which are permanent. Which&nbsp;
are more or less always true, okay? For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.360
"We live in New York". So, let's suppose that&nbsp;
this is where you live, right? Not just for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:28.880
short time, but for a long time, and more or less,&nbsp;
it's a permanent situation. It's always true for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:35.040
you. It doesn't mean it's completely true always,&nbsp;
but most of the time, this is where you live.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.280
So, that's what we consider permanent.&nbsp;
So, we could say "We live in New York",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:50.160
"He works at a bank", so when we say, "He works&nbsp;
at a bank", it means that's his permanent regular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.840
job, okay? It's not a temporary job, it's not&nbsp;
a job that he has just for a little while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.880
that's where he works most of the time, okay?&nbsp;
So, we use this for permanent situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.600
Think about yourself, okay? Whenever&nbsp;
you're trying to learn a tense,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.560
one of the great things you can do is to&nbsp;
think of an example that applies to your life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:19.360
or to people that you know. What is permanent&nbsp;
for you? So, you could say a sentence right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:28.320
such as "I live in _______", whichever city&nbsp;
you live in. Or, if you're working somewhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.320
and then you could say "I work&nbsp;
__________", okay? So, you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:41.120
by making these sentences are already using the&nbsp;
present simple tense. It's that simple. Okay.
&nbsp;

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.360
So, let's look at another situation in&nbsp;
which you can use the present simple tense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:54.880
For routines. So, what's a routine? A routine is&nbsp;
something you do regularly, okay? For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:07.600
"I wake up at 6:00 every day.", okay? "I go&nbsp;
to sleep at 11:00". So, wake, go, these verbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:14.240
are in the present simple tense because they're&nbsp;
talking about a regular activity, a routine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:23.840
We can also use this tense to talk about facts.&nbsp;
For example: "The sun rises in the east".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.520
It's just a fact, it's something that's a&nbsp;
scientific truth. It's not something that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:38.240
decided or you decided, it's just true. We could&nbsp;
also say "The sun sets in the west", okay?
&nbsp;

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.720
Next, we can use this tense&nbsp;
to talk about schedules,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.840
because think about it, what is a schedule? A&nbsp;
schedule tells us when something is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:58.160
happen, and that's kind of connected to this&nbsp;
point, right? A regularly scheduled event.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.720
So, for example, we could say&nbsp;
"Our class starts at 9:00."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.560
Why are we using present simple? Because&nbsp;
our class always starts at 9:00, alright?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:20.800
It's kind of permanent, it's kind of a routine,&nbsp;
it's a schedule. Or, the flight leaves at noon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.560
Not just this time, but the flight&nbsp;
always leaves at noon. It has a schedule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.160
and therefore we're using the present&nbsp;
simple tense with the words "starts"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.680
and "leaves". Okay, got that?
Now, let's look at one other situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:50.160
There are some words in English, and they're&nbsp;
called adverbs of frequency, to describe how often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.800
something is happening. And these words are shown&nbsp;
down here, but let's look at this sentence first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.560
"She always takes the bus". So, always is a&nbsp;
word that tells us how often something happens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:16.880
and all of these words down here are just like&nbsp;
that. So, if always is like 100% of the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:25.440
we have other words. We have the word "never",&nbsp;
which is 0%, it never happens. It doesn't happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:36.560
at all. So, we could say he or she never takes&nbsp;
the bus. We could also say, let's say, 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.280
of the time, okay, she takes the bus. So,&nbsp;
we could say "She sometimes takes the bus".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.840
Or, once in a while, okay,&nbsp;
"She rarely takes the bus".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:58.400
Or, "She often takes the bus". So, when you see&nbsp;
one of these words, which are called adverbs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:05.040
frequency, that also tells you that you should&nbsp;
be using the present simple tense, along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:11.600
these other situations. So, if you want to learn&nbsp;
it really well, as I said, apply it to yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:20.400
Say something about your routine. Say something&nbsp;
about what you always do, or what you never do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.280
and that way, you are already&nbsp;
using the present simple tense.
&nbsp;

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.240
Now, let's look at how to&nbsp;
form the present simple tense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:38.640
So, I've divided the board into three sections.&nbsp;
For positive sentences, negative sentences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:44.640
and for questions. And we'll go through&nbsp;
each one step by step, okay? So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:55.360
for these subjects, I, You, We, and They,&nbsp;
we just say "work". For example, "I work".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.440
You can say it after me, that way, you will&nbsp;
remember the grammar, you'll also get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:12.960
pronunciation, and it'll help you to learn and&nbsp;
remember. So, repeat after me: I work, you work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:27.920
we work, they work. Good. Now, look&nbsp;
what happens here. When it comes to he,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:36.880
she, and it, we need to add an "s", okay? That's&nbsp;
all. We need to add an "s" for he, she, and it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.560
not because it's plural, it's not&nbsp;
plural, but from a grammar point of view,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.280
in the present simple, we need to add an&nbsp;
"s" here. So, say it after me: He works,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:52.480 --> 00:23:04.080
she works, and it works. Okay? Very good. So,&nbsp;
that's for a positive or affirmative sentence.
&nbsp;

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:15.760
Now, let's look at a negative sentence. So, what&nbsp;
we would say is "I don't work" if we're shortening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:23.840
it, or we would say "I do not work". So, what&nbsp;
happened here? How did we make it negative?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.200
First, we have to add this word "do", and&nbsp;
down here, we have to add the word "does".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.400
So, this is a helping verb that we have to use&nbsp;
in this negative form, alright? So just learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:46.080
it the way it is and then you'll understand it&nbsp;
and you'll get used to it. So, we say "I do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:56.640
work". The "do not", when we shorten it, becomes&nbsp;
"don't", and how does that happen? We take out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:06.080
"o" here and then we squeeze these words together,&nbsp;
we join them together, and it becomes "don't". So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:12.720
first, let's say it with the contraction, with the&nbsp;
short form, because that's how we usually speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:21.760
It is correct to say, "I do not work", but usually&nbsp;
we'll say "I don't work", alright? But the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:29.760
important thing to remember is here we say, "I do&nbsp;
not work" but here it becomes "He does not work",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:38.080
and "does not" when we shorten it,&nbsp;
when we contract it, becomes "doesn't".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:46.880
So, what happened here? We cancelled the "o" and&nbsp;
again, we joined these two words "does" and "not"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:54.400
and it became "doesn't", and you can always know&nbsp;
how to spell this contraction or this short form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:01.280
because of where we put the apostrophe. We put&nbsp;
the apostrophe, this little comma that's in the in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:08.480
the air, in the place where we take out a&nbsp;
letter. So, we put it here instead of the "o"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:18.720
and we put it here instead of the "o". So, let's&nbsp;
go through these. I don't work, You don't work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:30.640
We don't work, They don't work. Now, let's go&nbsp;
to he, she, and it. Remember, he, she, and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:37.120
is always going to be a little bit different.&nbsp;
Let's hear it and say it: He doesn't work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:49.120
She doesn't work, It doesn't work. Let's say the&nbsp;
phone, the computer, it doesn't work, okay?
&nbsp;

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.440
Now, let's go to the questions. So, what&nbsp;
happens in the questions? In the question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:04.400
we also have to use that helping verb: "do".&nbsp;
"Do" here, and "does" down here, and we have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:12.720
change the order, so instead of saying "I do",&nbsp;
we say "Do I?", alright? So, repeat it after me:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:25.680
Do I work? I don't know, I don't remember.&nbsp;
Do you work? Do we work? Do they work?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:38.160
Down here, you would say, with he, she,&nbsp;
and it: Does he work? Does she work?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:47.440
Does it work? Alright? Now usually, of course,&nbsp;
you're not just going to say "Do you work?" You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.720
might say something more than that. Do you work&nbsp;
on Fridays? Do you work Monday to Friday? Do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.040
you work at the bank? Alright? So usually&nbsp;
there's something more, but I've just put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.320
the basic form here so that you understand&nbsp;
the structure of how to use this tense.
&nbsp;

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.880
Now, another important point is that&nbsp;
sometimes, when we ask questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:15.440
we don't just start with "do" or "does", but we&nbsp;
need to add a question word, right? So, maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:24.240
you want to say "where". What are the question&nbsp;
words, first of all: who, what, when, where, why,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:31.600
how, how much, how many, how often, okay?&nbsp;
These are all what are called question words,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:38.160
but if you have one of these question words,&nbsp;
all you have to do, it's really easy, the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:45.440
thing you have to do is to put that question&nbsp;
word right before this structure. So, "Where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:54.880
do you work?", right? When do you work?&nbsp;
Why do you work? How much do you work?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:02.640
How often do you work? But we're keeping the same&nbsp;
structure and we still need to have that helping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:11.840
verb "do". The same down here: Where does he work?&nbsp;
When does she work? Okay? So, keep that structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.920
and even if you have a question word, don't&nbsp;
worry, just put it at the beginning. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:24.800
here we have some examples: Where do&nbsp;
you live? What do you do? Okay?
&nbsp;

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:34.560
But the most important thing to remember is&nbsp;
this part, okay? He works. She works. It works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:41.680
This is the only place in the entire board&nbsp;
where we're adding an "s" to the verb itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.800
Everywhere else, we're just using the base form&nbsp;
of the verb, right? So, let's say our verb is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:57.840
"to work". So, here it's "work". I work, I don't&nbsp;
work, Do you work? He works, here it's different,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:06.000
but after that, it goes back to the base form&nbsp;
of the verb, right? He doesn't work. Does he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.520
work? So even though with he, she, and it&nbsp;
in the positive sentence we add the "s",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.360
but here in the negative, no, go back to the&nbsp;
base form and in the question, go back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.920
base form of the word "work", but you do need&nbsp;
to remember that in that positive sentence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:30.800
add the "s", okay? So, that's the structure&nbsp;
of the present simple tense. It's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.600
pretty straightforward, you just need&nbsp;
to practice it and you will get it.
&nbsp;

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.840
Now, let's look at some of the spelling changes&nbsp;
we need to make in the present simple tense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:49.920
We only need to make those changes, as I mentioned&nbsp;
earlier, when we're using he, she, or it, because,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:56.240
for example, we say "I work" but "He works",&nbsp;
right? So what was the spelling change we needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:04.240
there? We had to add an "s". And most of the&nbsp;
time, with most verbs, all you need to do is add&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:17.200
that "s". For example, dance becomes dances. You&nbsp;
can say it after me as well, okay? Cook - cooks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:30.080
Sleep - sleeps. Alright? So there, all we did,&nbsp;
we just added the "s" for the he, she, or it.
&nbsp;

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:40.720
Next, if the verb ends with&nbsp;
an s, or an sh, or a ch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:51.760
or an x, then we need to add "es". And we can&nbsp;
almost hear it, okay? Just listen. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:52.720 --> 00:31:01.760
kiss - kisses. You see that we're hearing "kisses"&nbsp;
"es" a little bit - it's a little bit longer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:14.680
so that tells us we need to add an "es".&nbsp;
The next one, wash becomes washes. Teach -&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:30.800
teaches. Fix - fixes. Okay? So, that's another&nbsp;
change. Another one is verbs ending in a consonant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:40.560
and y. What do I mean by that? If we look at this&nbsp;
verb: study, it ends with a y, right? And just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:48.880
before the y, we have a consonant. What's&nbsp;
a consonant? Anything that's not a vowel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:59.280
is a consonant. So, what's a vowel? A vowel in&nbsp;
English is a, e, i, o, or u. Everything else: b,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:09.120
d, g, x, etc., these are all consonants. So,&nbsp;
d is a consonant. Or here, in the word try,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:16.560
we have a y and before that, we have a consonant,&nbsp;
right? So, what happens in those cases? We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:26.240
to drop that last y and we have to add "ies".&nbsp;
You've probably seen this lots of times, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:36.240
but this is actually what's happening. So,&nbsp;
study becomes studies. Try becomes tries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:44.480
okay? You'll get it, you'll see. Fry - fries,&nbsp;
right? Like French fries, okay? Alright.
&nbsp;

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:52.080
So, then, last of all, there are some other&nbsp;
verbs. They're usually irregular verbs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:58.960
okay? These are the most common patterns, but&nbsp;
there are a few verbs where the ending might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.560
different in one way or another, okay? Sometimes&nbsp;
the verb really changes and you have to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.840
attention to that. You may be familiar with many&nbsp;
of these already, but here are a few examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:21.680
Go becomes like "I go", "He&nbsp;
goes". "I do", "She does".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:31.680
"I have", "It has". So you see that in&nbsp;
some cases, the verb changed completely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:38.400
okay? So these are the most common patterns for&nbsp;
spelling changes in the present simple tense.
&nbsp;

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.280
Now, let's look at how to give short answers&nbsp;
in English. See, in real conversation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:51.840
when someone asks you a question, we don't&nbsp;
usually repeat the whole question in our answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.640
We just give what's called like a short&nbsp;
answer. Let me give you an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:09.680
If someone says, "Do they need help?", then you&nbsp;
can just say, in short, either "Yes, they do" or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.880
"No, they don't". So, we do not have&nbsp;
to say "Yes, they need help", right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:22.720
You don't have to repeat that whole question.&nbsp;
You just give what's called the short answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.400
And how do you know how to shorten it?&nbsp;
It's really easy. So, if the question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:39.520
starts with "Do", like this, right? Then your&nbsp;
answer will include some form of "do" or "don't",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:46.960
depending on if it's a positive sentence or a&nbsp;
negative one. So, we see here "Do they need help?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:58.000
"Yes they do.", right? Or "No, they don't."&nbsp;
Alright? So, the "do", the way the question starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:05.520
is the way you will be able to answer it,&nbsp;
alright. It's really pretty simple, it really is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.680
The important thing to remember is that&nbsp;
in the affirmative or positive answer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:19.440
we cannot shorten it, okay? There is no way&nbsp;
to shorten that correctly. So here, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:26.320
to say "Yes, they do", but here we can use the&nbsp;
short form, or that contraction that we learned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:33.600
and you can say "No, they don't". Alright?
Let's look at another example. This time, I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:40.560
you'll be able to apply the principle yourself.&nbsp;
So, the question is "Does he speak French?".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:50.480
So, how did it start? With "does". So, what&nbsp;
are our options? "Yes, he does.", right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:51.680 --> 00:36:05.680
Or "No, he doesn't." Okay? Again, the "does" is&nbsp;
used in the short answer. "Yes, he does." "No,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:14.720
he doesn't." Got it? Alright. So, based on that,&nbsp;
you can see that you could answer any question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.960
that someone's asking you in present simple&nbsp;
by just listening carefully to the question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:26.480
but you do have to pay attention also to the&nbsp;
subject here. So for example, in this last one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:34.720
"Do you like this song?", somebody asks you,&nbsp;
"Do you like this song?". So your answer -&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:41.520
they're asking you, so you can't say "Yes,&nbsp;
you", you have you say "Yes, I". "Yes, I do",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:53.040
the "do" comes into play again, or "No, I don't."&nbsp;
So again, you do see the same principle applied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:58.800
all the way. And again, remember, in the&nbsp;
positive form, you cannot shorten it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:06.160
but in the negative form you can and you should&nbsp;
shorten it because that's how we normally speak,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.840
and these short answers are used a lot in normal&nbsp;
conversation, so it would be a good idea for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.080
to learn them and it's really pretty fast and&nbsp;
I think you might have already learned them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:25.920
So, do you understand? You could say "Yes, I do!"&nbsp;
I hope that's what you said, okay? Alright.
&nbsp;

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:31.280
Now, let's look at some common mistakes that&nbsp;
students often make when they start using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:36.880
present simple tense, and this way you'll know&nbsp;
what to be careful of so that you don't make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:44.480
these kind of mistakes, alright? Let's look. So&nbsp;
usually the mistakes are of four different kinds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.440
Sometimes, the mistake is in the tense itself. So&nbsp;
remember we mentioned at the beginning that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:58.400
can be present simple and present continuous, and&nbsp;
that present simple is for something permanent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:06.160
and present continuous is for something&nbsp;
temporary. So sometimes, learners get mixed up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:13.520
between these two tenses. So, let's say in this&nbsp;
example that this person lives in Tokyo, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:21.520
It's not just for a little while, it's where that&nbsp;
person lives. So, if that person said "I am living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:29.600
in Tokyo", that would be wrong. If that's where&nbsp;
the person stays permanently, he or she should say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:39.120
"I live in Tokyo". They could say "I am living&nbsp;
in Tokyo" only if it's something temporary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.400
alright? So, that is one mistake that's&nbsp;
sometimes made with the present simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:51.280
that confusion between it and present continuous.&nbsp;
Now, let's look at another kind of mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:58.400
That's when a mistake is made with the verb form.&nbsp;
You'll find it because now you're good at this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:03.280
okay? Ready, let's read. These are all&nbsp;
mistakes, okay, so these are all wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:09.040
we're going to correct them together. The&nbsp;
sentence right now says "We likes to travel."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.840
So, the verb is wrong. What should it be?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:25.920
"We like to travel". Say it after me: We&nbsp;
like to travel. Good. Here's a mistake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:33.040
the same thing in the verb form, but in a&nbsp;
negative sentence: "They doesn't eat vegetables."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:45.840
That's wrong, you know that. What should it be?&nbsp;
"They don't eat vegetables". Say it after me:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:52.400
"They don't eat vegetables". Good.&nbsp;
And here's a mistake in the question:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:54.160 --> 00:40:01.360
"Does you talk to him often?" That's wrong.&nbsp;
We can't say that. We need to say what?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:13.280
"Do you". Say it after me: "Do you talk to him&nbsp;
often?" Good. Alright? So those are verb form kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:20.240
of mistakes. Another mistake that's possible is in&nbsp;
spelling. We looked at the many kinds of spelling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:26.480
right, and you need to make the changes. So&nbsp;
here, the person wrote "She trys to save money",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:32.640
but the spelling of the verb is incorrect, because&nbsp;
here it's a y and before that it's a consonant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:41.920
remember? So what should it be? "Tries".&nbsp;
They had to drop that "y" and add "ies". So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.400
you'll pick up those spelling changes, okay?&nbsp;
Just pay attention when you're reading and so on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:52.800
and it'll come to you unnaturally.
Next, sometimes an entire word is missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.040
So, let's look at this one. This is a&nbsp;
question: "What time you finish work?".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.640
It almost sounds right, but it's not. It's&nbsp;
wrong. Grammatically in English, that's wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:14.240
Can you understand it? Yes, you can understand it,&nbsp;
but it's still wrong. So, how do we correct it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:24.640
Did you find the mistake? So we should&nbsp;
say "What time do you finish work?".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.520
So, what was missing was that helping&nbsp;
word, okay, that helping verb, remember,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:35.360
we do have to add that even if you have&nbsp;
a question word here like "what time",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.080
alright? "What time do you finish work?". So,&nbsp;
these are the four main kinds of mistakes that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:49.440
have to be careful of. In tense, using the wrong&nbsp;
tense, using the wrong verb form, making any kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:57.520
of spelling mistakes, or leaving out an essential&nbsp;
verb or helping verb. Alright? That's it!
&nbsp;

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.840
You've been learning a lot, so now it's&nbsp;
time to practice. Let's get started.
&nbsp;

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:10.000
Number 1: I take, but he ________.&nbsp;
What would you say in present simple?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:22.080
I take, he takes, right? You have to&nbsp;
add that "s" there, right? Very good.
&nbsp;

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:30.880
Now, let's work it the other way.
Number 2: She does, We _______. Do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:38.400
know it? We do. Very good.
Number 3: You enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:51.920
She ______. Yes, I can hear you.&nbsp;
She enjoys. Very good. Alright
&nbsp;

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:59.360
Now, let's make some phrases negative, alright,&nbsp;
so we're going from positive to negative.
&nbsp;

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:06.080
Number 4: They study. They&nbsp;
________________. Use the contraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:18.960
They don't study. Right? "Don't" being short&nbsp;
for what? Do not. Right, you've got it.
&nbsp;

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:27.840
Number 5: The next one. He sings. Make&nbsp;
it negative. He ________________. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:41.040
He doesn't sing. "Doesn't" is short&nbsp;
for what? Does not. Very good.
&nbsp;

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.400
Now, let's make some questions. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.480
let's read the sentence first.
Number 6: She wants to buy a new phone.
&nbsp;

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.480
How would we ask the question? What's the&nbsp;
helping verb you have to use, helping word?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:12.800
Do, or does, giving you a clue there. Here, it's&nbsp;
"She", so we have to say, "Does she want to buy a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:19.120
new phone?" Okay, so remember, we come back to the&nbsp;
base form of the verb and we have to use "do" or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:27.840
"does", but because it's she, we're saying "does".&nbsp;
"Does she want to buy a new phone?" Okay? Good.
&nbsp;

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.520
Let's do the last one.
Number 7: They sell books online.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.160
Ask a question about that. Again,&nbsp;
what are you going to start with?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:51.440
"Do" this time, right. "Do they sell books&nbsp;
online?", right? Okay? Why "do"? Because now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:57.600
we're talking about they. And why "does" here?&nbsp;
Because we were talking about "she", alright.
&nbsp;

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:03.520
So, if you got those right, that's great! If you&nbsp;
got any wrong, maybe you can go back later and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.840
check those parts, but we're going to practice&nbsp;
some more, we're going to learn a little bit more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:12.960
and you'll get it for sure by the&nbsp;
end of this, okay. Stick with me.
&nbsp;

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:19.040
To review: you know the present simple tense when&nbsp;
you know when you use it, which we talked about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:26.000
and how to use it. And how do you know that you&nbsp;
know how to use it? When you can do these things:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:33.280
you can make a positive sentence, a negative&nbsp;
sentence, and a question. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:41.840
you should be able to say easily "They live in&nbsp;
Amsterdam." or "They don't live in Amsterdam." or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:49.680
"Do they live in Amsterdam?". You should be able&nbsp;
to switch easily and comfortably and quickly and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:57.440
correctly between these three sentences, okay?
So, remember, this is the present simple tense,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:04.560
but this is an entire series that we have of&nbsp;
English tenses, so from the present simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:10.400
you can go to the next class which is on the&nbsp;
present continuous tense, and that way you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:17.280
take your English forward step by step, alright?&nbsp;
And if you'd like a little more practice on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.040
tense, the present simple tense, go to&nbsp;
www.engvid.com , alright? Thank you very much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:28.640
for watching, I know you're a serious student,&nbsp;
and I know you're going to make good progress.
&nbsp;

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:36.720
Hi, I'm Rebecca, and welcome to this class on the&nbsp;
present continuous tense, which is also called the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:44.800
present progressive tense. Now, this class is part&nbsp;
of the engVid series on English verb tenses. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:51.200
the present continuous tense is a basic tense.&nbsp;
It's usually one of the first tenses that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:58.720
start to learn when you start studying English.&nbsp;
However, it doesn't exist in every language,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:05.280
and it might not exist in your language. So, it's&nbsp;
possible to make mistakes very easily and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:11.200
a basic tense, so we really don't want to make&nbsp;
those kind of mistakes. So, just stay with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.840
We're going to go through it step by step. I'll&nbsp;
show you exactly how to use it, we'll do lots of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:23.840
practice together, and you will understand and be&nbsp;
able to use it. So, are you ready? Let's start.
&nbsp;

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:34.720
So, there are two basic tenses, first, to start&nbsp;
to talk about the present. They are the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:42.000
simple and the present continuous, okay? We know&nbsp;
it has two names, I'm just going to use one name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.960
So, what's the difference? Let's look at some&nbsp;
examples in each of these tenses. So, in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:58.080
present simple, I would say "I work". In the&nbsp;
present continuous, I would say "I am working".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:07.520
So, what is the difference between these two? "I&nbsp;
am working" talks about something that's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:16.560
right now. For example, I am teaching.&nbsp;
You are watching. You are listening. Or,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:22.960
it can also talk about something temporary,&nbsp;
like you're watching this lesson this moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:31.280
but also for a short time. Short is a general&nbsp;
idea, okay? So, it could be something that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:39.680
happening now, or something temporary.
However, we use "I work" in present simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:49.280
to talk about things that are true in general.&nbsp;
I work in this company, but I'm working now. Or,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:56.400
I work in this company, but I'm not working&nbsp;
now. I'm having lunch. See the difference, okay?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:04.000
We also use present simple to talk about things&nbsp;
that are more permanent, like your job, right? You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.760
don't change your job usually every day. It's more&nbsp;
or less permanent; where you work, where you live.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:17.040
This is more permanent and general, present&nbsp;
simple, and this is more temporary and now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:24.320
So, that's the basic overview and the basic&nbsp;
idea. And, how do we actually form this tense?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.480
We form it by using the subject&nbsp;
like I, you, we, they, he, she, it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:38.080
plus the verb "to be", plus the verb,&nbsp;
plus -ing. Let's look at an example:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:46.080
"I am working". So, we have the&nbsp;
subject and the verb "to be" and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:55.520
each form of the verb "to be". I am working, You&nbsp;
are working, We are working, They are working,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:04.400
He is working, She is working, It's working,&nbsp;
okay? Like the computer, the air conditioner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:10.240
whatever, okay? So, that's the&nbsp;
basic overview of this tense.
&nbsp;

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:16.560
Now, let's look at when we use the present&nbsp;
continuous tense. So, as we saw earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:23.440
we can definitely use it to talk about something&nbsp;
that's happening right now. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:31.680
"The baby is sleeping", don't make noise, okay?&nbsp;
Or for example, "Oh, it's raining outside",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:39.360
alright? So those are examples of something&nbsp;
happening right now. We can also use this tense to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:48.160
talk about something that's happening around now.&nbsp;
For example, "He is writing a book". So, he might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:56.400
not be writing it this minute, but he's writing&nbsp;
it around now. We don't know how long it'll take,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:03.040
but it's happening around this time. So,&nbsp;
we can use it in that context. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:10.080
we could also say "He's working on a project".&nbsp;
Maybe the project is going to take one week and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:16.560
maybe it'll take one year, or ten years, we don't&nbsp;
know, but it's happening around now, okay?
&nbsp;

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:24.960
Next, we can also use it to talk about&nbsp;
something temporary. Not something that happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:31.520
all the time, but something temporary. For&nbsp;
example, that book, right? We don't know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.200
maybe it's going to take him three years to write&nbsp;
the book, but in his mind, it's not something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:44.160
that's going to last forever. It's something&nbsp;
temporary, okay? So, this is more about how you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:51.680
look at what is happening. Or, this example,&nbsp;
something temporary, "We are staying at hotel".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:58.240
We live in our home, that's permanent,&nbsp;
but right now, while we're in this city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:05.440
while we're travelling, we are staying at a&nbsp;
hotel. That's something temporary. Okay?
&nbsp;

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:13.280
Next, we can also use it to talk about a&nbsp;
trend. A trend is something that's changing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:21.680
okay? Something that's developing. For example,&nbsp;
"The prices of homes are increasing". Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:28.080
say the prices were here, and now the prices are&nbsp;
going up, so we can say the prices are increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:34.800
Some sort of changes that are happening. And we&nbsp;
can also talk about a trend in terms of something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:42.080
that's popular. Often, we talk about things -&nbsp;
fashion trends, for example, right? People are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:48.320
wearing a certain color. People are wearing bright&nbsp;
colors this summer, or people are wearing certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:56.560
kinds of shoes. So, we can talk about trends&nbsp;
using this present continuous tense, alright?
&nbsp;

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:03.200
So, those are the basic ways in which we use&nbsp;
this tense, but I just want to let you know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:09.760
there are also two slightly more advanced&nbsp;
ways in which we can use this tense. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:15.680
let's look at what they are. The first one is&nbsp;
to talk about some kind of repeated action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:21.440
but it's usually something negative. So,&nbsp;
we're using it to kind of - when we want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:27.840
to complain about something. For example,&nbsp;
if you say, "They're always making noise",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:36.640
that's a negative remark, right? So, we can&nbsp;
use "always" in this context with the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:46.800
continuous tense. Usually, we use words like&nbsp;
always, never, sometimes, frequently, and so on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.800
to talk about present simple. Something that's&nbsp;
true in general. For example, "They always help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:58.000
us", or just to talk about facts. But when&nbsp;
you're talking about something negative,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
then very often we can use this present continuous&nbsp;
tense, but that's a slightly more advanced way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.840
use it, so don't worry about it too much, but&nbsp;
you might hear people using it that way.
&nbsp;

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:17.040
And, another point, I know that I said this&nbsp;
is called the present continuous, and it talks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:25.840
about the present, not the past, not the future,&nbsp;
the present, however, sometimes we can actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:32.960
use it to talk about the future, but only in&nbsp;
a special way. So, let's look at what that is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:42.800
If I say, "She's flying to Mexico next week.",&nbsp;
now, if I didn't say "next week", if I only said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:49.440
"She's flying to Mexico", what does it mean? It's&nbsp;
happening right now. So, when I want to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:56.320
tense to talk about the future, I have to say&nbsp;
something like this. I have to say next week,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:03.200
tomorrow, next summer, next year, I have to give&nbsp;
it some kind of time in the future and then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:10.000
can use present continuous for the future in a&nbsp;
slightly more advanced way, okay? So, those are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.360
the basic ways in which we use this tense.
Now, let's look at when not to use the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:23.600
continuous tense. So, first of all, everything&nbsp;
here, all these examples, these are all wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:30.160
okay? And we're going to understand why. So,&nbsp;
we cannot use the present continuous tense to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:38.080
talk about any permanent actions or activities.&nbsp;
For example, for most people, where they live,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:43.600
where they work, these are more or less&nbsp;
permanent. They don't change every day. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:52.240
not temporary, right? So, if I live in Canada&nbsp;
all the time, then it would be wrong to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.360
"I am living in Canada". That would only&nbsp;
be okay if it was something temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:06.080
Similarly, if I work at ABC company, and that's&nbsp;
my permanent job, it would be wrong to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:13.120
"I am working at ABC Company". I would&nbsp;
need to say, "I work at ABC Company".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:20.160
That would be a difference tense, the present&nbsp;
simple tense. And similarly here, if I live in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:25.840
Canada, I need to say "I live in Canada" and not&nbsp;
"I am living", because that would be temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:31.760
So, that's the most common kind of mistake that&nbsp;
people make, so be really careful of that.
&nbsp;

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:40.560
Similarly, we have stative verbs. This is another&nbsp;
area that you have to be really careful about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:48.320
Why? Because in English, there are two kinds of&nbsp;
verbs: action verbs and what are called stative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:55.840
verbs. So, action verbs are your normal verbs&nbsp;
that you know most of the time like work, run,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:05.040
play, jump, okay? And stative verbs describe&nbsp;
a state, or a condition. It could be a mental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:14.960
state. It could be an emotional state, okay? And&nbsp;
with this tense, we cannot use stative verbs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:22.720
and in fact, in any continuous tense in English,&nbsp;
you cannot use stative verbs. Let me give you some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:31.600
examples of stative verbs. For example, it would&nbsp;
be wrong to say, "I am understanding English". No.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:39.040
You cannot say that, because "understand" is a&nbsp;
stative verb, to do with your mind, so it's wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:47.040
to say that, okay? This is all wrong, okay. It&nbsp;
would be wrong to say, "We are liking this show".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:54.640
Liking is wrong because "like" is a&nbsp;
stative verb. So, we would need to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:54.640 --> 00:58:05.120
"We like this show". "I understand English", okay?&nbsp;
Similarly, here, when you talk about verbs that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:13.680
refer to what you own, what you possess, what you&nbsp;
have, we cannot use those verbs in the stative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:20.960
form with this tense. So, it would be wrong&nbsp;
to say, "They are having a car". You would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:29.760
need to say, "They have a car". Similarly,&nbsp;
again, there's a long list of stative verbs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:38.240
but the verb "need" and the verb "want" are very&nbsp;
common verbs which are usually stative verbs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:44.720
therefore you can't use them in this tense. So,&nbsp;
it would be wrong to say, "Are you needing help?".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:51.920
You would need to say, "Do you need help?", okay?&nbsp;
So, whether you have learned the present simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:57.200
or not, don't worry right now, just understand&nbsp;
that with the present continuous, you cannot use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:05.200
stative verbs, so everything here is wrong.
Now, let's look at how we form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:10.080
the present continuous tense. Let's&nbsp;
start by looking at a sample sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:21.520
"I am working". So, we saw that there are&nbsp;
three parts: I, which is the subject, am,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:30.160
in this case, which is a form of the verb&nbsp;
"to be", then we have the verb "work", right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:39.520
and then we have "-ing", alright? So,&nbsp;
in order to use this tense correctly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:46.320
you need to know two things: you need to be&nbsp;
sure that you know the verb "to be" perfectly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:53.680
and then you need to know how to add the verb +&nbsp;
ing and any changes you need to make in spelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:54.400 --> 01:00:01.600
So, what I've done is I've divided this lesson.&nbsp;
First; into just looking into the verb "to be"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.840
to make sure that you're using it correctly,&nbsp;
because if you have mistakes in the verb "to be",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.320
this central part, then you will make mistakes&nbsp;
in this tense. But if you've got it right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:21.040
then you'll be absolutely fine. So, let's just&nbsp;
take a minute to review the verb "to be", alright?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:28.880
And then we'll move on to the next part.
So, in a positive sentence, it would be I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:47.760
You are. We are. They are. He is. She is. It is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:55.440
Now, when we say the verb "to be", the verb "to&nbsp;
be" is one of the most common verbs, but it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:05.920
used in two ways. One is by itself. For example, I&nbsp;
can say "I am a teacher.", or we can also use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:14.960
verb "to be" as a helping verb, as it's being used&nbsp;
in this tense. Then, I could say "I am teaching".&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.680
Now, the verb "to be" became a helping verb, but&nbsp;
one way or the other, whether I'm using the verb&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:30.960
"to be" by itself or I'm using it in this context,&nbsp;
then I still need to know exactly how to use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:45.600
verb "to be". So now, let's look at the negative.&nbsp;
I am not. You are not. We are not. They are not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:53.120
What do you notice? We're just adding "not",&nbsp;
right? Let's do it a little bit more. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:53.120 --> 01:02:02.000
is not. She is not. It is not. Okay? Right&nbsp;
now, don't worry about this last part. We're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.720
going to add that soon, okay? Let's just get&nbsp;
this part right, the verb "to be", alright?
&nbsp;

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:15.520
Next, let's look at when we have the verb&nbsp;
"to be" in a question or in our tense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:24.640
So, what do we do? Instead of saying "I am",&nbsp;
we say "Am I?". If you had the verb after that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.160
you'd say, "Am I working?" and so on, but we'll&nbsp;
look at that in a minute. Right now, just master&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:36.400
this part. It's a critical part of understanding&nbsp;
and using this tense correctly. Are you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:52.320
Are we? Are they? Right? The same at the bottom&nbsp;
here: Is he? Is she? Is it? Alright? So, make&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:58.080
sure that you can use the verb "to be" so that you&nbsp;
can use the present continuous tense correctly.
&nbsp;

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.840
Now, let's look at how we form the full&nbsp;
present continuous tense. You already&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:11.840
know the verb "to be", now we'll say a positive&nbsp;
sentence, a negative sentence, and a question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:18.400
So you can repeat after me, it will be very&nbsp;
good practice to also hear the correct form.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:34.080
I am working. You are working. We are&nbsp;
working. They are working. He is working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:46.160
She is working. It is working. Okay, got&nbsp;
that? Good. For the negative, it's very easy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:55.520
you just add "not" before the verb, plus the -ing,&nbsp;
so "not working", right? You are not working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:03.520
He is not working. They are not working. Like&nbsp;
that, okay? It's very simple, just take this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:11.200
and add "not working". Now, for the question, we&nbsp;
have to reverse the order. So, instead of saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:17.280
"I am", we say "Am I?", right? Just like with the&nbsp;
verb "to be", same thing, that's why I told you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:23.520
the verb "to be" is so important, it's part of&nbsp;
this tense. So, repeat after me, the questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:35.840
Am I working today? Are you working?&nbsp;
Are we working? Are they working?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:50.480
Is he working? Is she working? Is it working? So,&nbsp;
that's your basic question form. Now remember,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:56.240
you can always add a question word&nbsp;
before that. For example, you could say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:08.840
"When are you working?". Where are you working?&nbsp;
How long are you working? But what's important -&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:21.040
what's important if you do that is to keep&nbsp;
this same order. Keep your question order.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:28.080
Don't turn it back into a sentence. Just add the&nbsp;
question word, like when, or how long, or why,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:36.480
or something like that, and keep this structure.&nbsp;
When are you working? Where are you working? Why&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:42.480
are you working? And so on, okay? And that's&nbsp;
how you form the present continuous tense.
&nbsp;

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:49.360
Now, let's look at how we use contractions in&nbsp;
the present continuous tense. So, in English,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:57.280
sometimes, instead of saying, for example,&nbsp;
"I am learning", we shorten it or contract it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:06.800
and say, "I'm learning". So, why do we do&nbsp;
that? Usually, it's faster, it's easier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:14.960
and we use it a lot in informal conversation&nbsp;
and also in informal writing. We do not usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:23.200
use contractions like these in formal business&nbsp;
writing or in academic writing, but we use them&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.400
a lot on an everyday basis. So, let's see how&nbsp;
to spell them and how to pronounce them.
&nbsp;

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:39.120
So, I am becomes I'm. What happened here?&nbsp;
We took away the A and put an apostrophe&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:48.720
where we took away the letter and we joined&nbsp;
those two words. I'm. You are becomes you're.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:51.840 --> 01:07:11.480
We are becomes we're. They are becomes&nbsp;
they're. He is becomes he's. She is --&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:24.640
she's. And it is -- it's. Okay? Alright, so&nbsp;
let's say a sentence, a really short sentence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:30.720
with these contractions, so you can learn how&nbsp;
to say them easily and naturally. I'm learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:43.840
You're learning. We're learning.&nbsp;
They're learning. He's learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:55.120
She's learning. It's learning. Okay? Good.
Now, we can do the same thing when it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:05.280
negative. So, instead of saying "I am not",&nbsp;
we can shorten it in one way only, we can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:12.880
"I'm not". So basically, we just took the "I'm"&nbsp;
and added "not", alright? So, we just got rid&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:19.520
of this and then we joined these two, okay?&nbsp;
Sorry, we didn't join them, but we used them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:29.040
one after the other, okay? I'm not. So, let's say&nbsp;
a sentence: I'm not watching. Are you watching TV?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:38.160
No, you can put it off, I'm not watching,&nbsp;
okay? Next: You are not becomes what? There&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:45.360
are two possibilities here. First, let's just add&nbsp;
"not". So, "you are not" can become you're not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:58.400
we're not, they're not. Or, "You are not"&nbsp;
can be contracted in a different way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:07.200
Here, we're just going to take away the O here&nbsp;
and put an apostrophe and combine these two.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:15.120
What we did here is we took this one and we&nbsp;
got rid of this letter and combined this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:22.480
So, let's look at it for a second. "You are&nbsp;
not here" became "You're not". We contracted&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:31.120
these two words. "You are not here", we got&nbsp;
rid of the o and we joined these two words:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:40.400
are not. So, the other possibility is "You&nbsp;
aren't". Say it after me: You aren't watching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:52.800
We aren't watching. They aren't watching.&nbsp;
Okay? Very good. The same here - "He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.080
is not" can become "He's not",&nbsp;
right? We got rid of this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:13.200
She's not, It's not. Or, we can get rid of the&nbsp;
o here and join this and we can say "He isn't",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:25.680
She isn't watching. It isn't watching. So that's&nbsp;
how we spell and pronounce the contractions.
&nbsp;

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.080
Now, let's look at some spelling changes we need&nbsp;
to make to the verb when we're using the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:40.720
continuous tense. So, with all of the verbs, you&nbsp;
need to add "-ing". And to most of the verbs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:52.560
that's all you need to do. You just need to add&nbsp;
"ing". For example, eat becomes eating. Walk -&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:59.280
walking, right? All we did was add that "ing",&nbsp;
but with some verbs you need to make a few small&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:09.920
other changes. For verbs ending in E, we need&nbsp;
to drop the E and then add "ing". For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:23.120
use becomes using, so we dropped or cancelled&nbsp;
this E and added ing. Take becomes taking. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:33.840
we dropped or cancelled the e, alright? Good.
For verbs ending in "ie", we need to drop the ie&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:48.400
and add y and then add the ing. For example, lie,&nbsp;
right, l-i-e, cancel ie, add y, then ing. Lying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:50.320 --> 01:12:04.000
Tie becomes tying, okay? That's it!
Now, for some verbs, ending in a C-V-C pattern,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:13.120
we have to double the last letter. What does&nbsp;
that C-V-C? C stands for consonant, V for vowel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:22.160
and C again for consonant. A vowel in English is&nbsp;
A,E,I,O or U and a consonant is any other letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:30.320
So, what you do is look at the verb, alright, you&nbsp;
look at the verb from the end, it will be easier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:38.640
and if it follows that pattern, right, C, a p is&nbsp;
a consonant, an a is a vowel, and then the l is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:45.440
a consonant, so if it follows that pattern,&nbsp;
C-V-C, then double that last letter. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:51.200
there are some special circumstances, it doesn't&nbsp;
always apply, but it often applies. There are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:58.480
patterns in English spelling and sometimes there&nbsp;
are exceptions. So, in this case, clap becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:08.240
clapping. Sit becomes sitting. Okay? And those are&nbsp;
the major spelling changes you need to make.
&nbsp;

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.040
Now, let's look at how to give short&nbsp;
answers in the present continuous tense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:20.480
So, in English, if someone asks you a question&nbsp;
and your basic answer is "Yes" or "No", we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:27.840
usually just say "Yes" or "No". We usually say a&nbsp;
little bit more than that. But, at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.640
we don't have to repeat everything they asked&nbsp;
us in the question in our answer. So, what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:43.680
do is something like this. If someone says, "Is he&nbsp;
working late?" you could simply say "Yes, he is",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:51.840
or "No, he isn't." And how do you know what to&nbsp;
say here? You just take it from here, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:52.400 --> 01:14:03.440
So, is he? Yes, he is. Or, no, he isn't. Alright,&nbsp;
so, what's important to notice is that in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:09.600
positive answer, you cannot use any contraction.&nbsp;
You cannot shorten it and say "Yes, he's".&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:16.880
No, that's wrong. But in the negative, you can&nbsp;
definitely use the contraction. You can say "No,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:25.280
he is not", it's not wrong, but usually we'll&nbsp;
just use the contraction. The same thing here:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:37.440
"Are they going to the meeting?" So, we could say&nbsp;
what? Yes, they are, or no, they aren't, okay?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:44.240
So, you're basically taking your answer&nbsp;
clues from the question itself. And again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.280
no contraction possible in the positive answer.
Here's another one. "Are you studying?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:53.120 --> 01:15:00.720
So here, it's going to be a little bit different.&nbsp;
Why? Because they're asking, "Are you" and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:08.480
they're - you have to answer with "I", right? So&nbsp;
here, you cannot use it, but you will simply say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:18.480
"Yes I am" or "No, I'm not". Got it? You can't&nbsp;
take it from there, but you can still just give&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:24.080
a short answer. You don't have to say "Yes, I am&nbsp;
studying", "No, I am not studying", just say "Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:31.440
I am", "No, I'm not". In fact, it's a good thing&nbsp;
to just know this phrase, alright? Yes, I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.840
No, I'm not. So, for example, if I ask you "Are&nbsp;
you learning the present continuous tense?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:48.000
"Yes, I am." "Are you making progress in your&nbsp;
English?" "Yes, I am". "Are you feeling happy?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.840
I hope you're saying "Yes, I am."
Now, let's practice what you've been learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.800
So, we have some positive sentences we're going&nbsp;
to work with, some negative ones, and some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:08.800
questions. So, first, we'll take a sentence&nbsp;
which is in present simple and we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:19.840
change it to present continuous, okay?
Number 1 -- "I go" becomes what? "I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:39.680
am going." Or "I'm going." Alright? You can also&nbsp;
contract it or shorten it. "We wait". Let's use&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:53.200
the contracted form and turn it into the present&nbsp;
continuous form. "We wait" becomes what? "We're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:05.040
waiting", right? We're waiting.&nbsp;
We are waiting. We're waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:12.160
Good. "They play" - again, let's use the&nbsp;
contraction just so you can practice the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:19.840
spelling, also where to put that apostrophe and so&nbsp;
on and pay attention to it. "They play." becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:35.760
"They're playing.", okay? Very nice. Alright.
Now, we have a sentence that's already&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:42.400
in present continuous. What we want to&nbsp;
do is to change it to the negative form&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:49.520
in present continuous. "She's calling." How&nbsp;
can we make that negative? There are two ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:50.960 --> 01:18:06.080
She's calling - make it negative - She's not&nbsp;
calling, this is one way, and the other way - She&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:19.920
isn't calling, right? Those were the two ways that&nbsp;
we learned. She's not calling. She isn't calling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:29.760
Alright? Very good. "We're cooking". Make it&nbsp;
negative. First, the easy way, you can always&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:39.200
just use the easy way too, if you're unsure -&nbsp;
We're not cooking. I call this one the easy way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:45.440
because you just need to add "not" and it's 100%&nbsp;
right. It's not like that one is better than this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:56.960
one, no, everything is equally correct. We're not&nbsp;
cooking, or what's the other way though? We aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:05.120
cooking. Okay? So again, pay&nbsp;
attention to the spelling there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:18.080
Next, number 6 - "I'm reading". Make&nbsp;
it negative. What will it become? I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:29.840
not reading, and in this case, that's the only&nbsp;
form that we can make it negative. Alright.
&nbsp;

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:36.160
Now, the questions. So, right now, it's&nbsp;
just a sentence. Let's see how we can make&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:43.760
it into a question. "They are buying a new&nbsp;
car." Make it a question, it's really easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:54.960
Got it? Yes, just move these around. Are they&nbsp;
buying a new car? And of course, the first word&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:03.840
will be capitalized, and the second word will not.&nbsp;
"She is doing her homework." Make it a question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:13.600
what is it? The same thing. Is she doing her&nbsp;
homework? Good. And if you're writing it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:19.280
again, it would be capital for the first&nbsp;
letter and then not capital after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:27.200
"We are leaving at 8:00." Make&nbsp;
it a question - same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:36.400
Are we leaving at 8:00? And of course, at the&nbsp;
end of each of these, we would have a question&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:42.960
mark if you're writing it down. So, how did you&nbsp;
do? Hope everything is going well, and I'm sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.600
it is. Let's look at a little bit more.
Now, let's look at some common mistakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.880
that are made with the present continuous&nbsp;
tense, and you can help me correct them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:01.440
The first kind of mistake - sometimes&nbsp;
the verb "to be" is missing. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:09.520
"My brother watching the news". So, what did&nbsp;
that student need to say? What did that person&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:15.920
want to say? What's missing? The verb&nbsp;
"to be"? So, we have to say "My brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:25.280
is watching the news", okay? Remember,&nbsp;
we have the subject, the verb "to be",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:32.880
and then the verb + ing. Sometimes, the same&nbsp;
thing can happen but in a negative sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:39.200
For example, this person wrote "John&nbsp;
not helping". How can we correct that?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:49.760
"John" - the easy way to correct it is to&nbsp;
say "John is not helping" or you can always&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:49.760 --> 01:22:00.880
contract it and say "John's not helping". Okay?&nbsp;
Or we can say "John isn't helping". Alright.
&nbsp;

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:10.160
Sometimes, the verb "to be" is missing in&nbsp;
a question. Instead of saying "She going?",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:15.120
what's wrong there? What should&nbsp;
we be saying? We should be saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:27.360
"Is she going?". Is she going, right? Again,&nbsp;
we needed that verb "to be". We can't have this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:33.680
tense without the verb "to be", right? That's&nbsp;
why we looked at it so many times, so make&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:40.560
sure that you don't forget it. Next, sometimes&nbsp;
the verb "to be" is there, but it's incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:47.040
There's an incorrect form of it being used.&nbsp;
For example, this person wrote "Bob and Maria&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.600
is driving home". That's not right. They have&nbsp;
the verb "to be" but it's not in the right form&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:00.880
because "Bob and Maria" is like "they",&nbsp;
right, so it should be "Bob and Maria&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:11.440
are driving home", okay? And here,&nbsp;
this person wrote "He ain't studying."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:21.840
Now, "ain't" is actually slang. You might hear it&nbsp;
a lot in songs or in music or in movies, okay, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:28.640
in academic English, in correct grammar, it's&nbsp;
not acceptable, so if you're doing an exam or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.320
if you're writing a paper for university or if&nbsp;
you're trying to impress a client, it's probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:39.840
not such a good idea to use it. Instead of that,&nbsp;
you should use the correct version which is what?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:49.120
"He isn't studying", okay? That doesn't mean you&nbsp;
can never use slang, you can certainly use slang&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.960
with your friends or casually whenever you&nbsp;
want to, but just be aware - what is slang,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.400
and what is not slang.
Next, sometimes the verb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:08.320
the main verb, not the verb "to be", but the verb&nbsp;
in the sentence is used incorrectly. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:16.960
this person wrote "She is do her&nbsp;
homework". How can we fix that? "She is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:30.080
doing her homework". And this one wrote "The&nbsp;
game is start now". It should be "The game is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:42.720
starting now", okay? There we go, good. See,&nbsp;
I'm sure you can find these now yourself, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.520
And that's the way. Now you've learned, you&nbsp;
know the rules, you're able to apply the words,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:52.160
whether you're reading something or whether&nbsp;
you're looking at something or whether you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.080
writing it yourself or whether you're&nbsp;
speaking, it will come out right.
&nbsp;

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:05.120
Next, sometimes mistakes are made in spelling. For&nbsp;
example, there are several mistakes here. "She's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:15.360
lieing" but this should be what? Not lie, lying.&nbsp;
This was one of those verbs also, "She's siting",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:26.000
but it's consonant, vowel, consonant, so we need&nbsp;
to double the last letter, sitting, and here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:35.840
"writeing", ends with an E, the verb "write", so&nbsp;
we need to get rid of that E, okay? So be careful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.760
of those spelling changes that we talked about.&nbsp;
Also, here's a spelling mistake. This person wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:49.800
"Were going to the mall." That's what they&nbsp;
wanted to say, but what's missing here? The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:58.880
apostrophe, good. So, that goes right&nbsp;
here, okay? Instead of "We are" it became&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:07.760
"We're". "We're going to the mall". Okay?
Next, sometimes people forget, and they use a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:14.240
stative verb anyway in this tense and they might&nbsp;
say something like "I am needing some water.",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:21.680
but can we say that? No. In correct English, you&nbsp;
cannot say that, because "need" is one of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:30.480
stated verbs. So, you'd need to change that and&nbsp;
just say "I need some water". The same here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:39.040
"I'm wanting to visit Hawaii". No, "want" is&nbsp;
another stated verb, so we just say, "I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:47.040
to visit Hawaii", okay? And last of all, remember&nbsp;
what I told you, what we talked about earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.160
that we don't and should not be using this&nbsp;
tense to talk about permanent situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.800
So, for example, somebody asked this&nbsp;
person "What does your company do?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:04.160
and he said, "We are manufacturing cars."&nbsp;
But that's not right, because it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:10.640
something they do just temporarily, it&nbsp;
takes a lot of work and organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:19.440
to do this work, so it should be not "We are&nbsp;
manufacturing cars.", but just "We manufacture&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:28.800
cars.", okay? So, in that case, using the present&nbsp;
continuous tense would be incorrect. You just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:34.720
needed there - the other present simple tense. So,&nbsp;
these are some of the common mistakes, and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:40.480
you see that once you know the rules, the rules&nbsp;
actually make it easier for you. They free you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:45.840
speak and communicate more correctly.
So, we've covered a lot in this class.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:52.560
Let's review now, just one last time. You&nbsp;
know this tense when you can make, what?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:53.200 --> 01:28:00.960
A positive sentence, a negative sentence, and a&nbsp;
question. For example: "David is making coffee."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:09.680
A positive. "David is not making coffee." A&nbsp;
negative sentence. "Is David making coffee?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:18.720
A question, or to add question words to that, for&nbsp;
example, "When is David making coffee?" "Why is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:26.240
David making coffee?", and so on. Okay? So, what&nbsp;
can you do from here? To practice this tense,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:31.680
try to think of examples in your own life. Talk&nbsp;
to yourself as you're going through your day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:38.240
What are you doing at that moment? I'm waking&nbsp;
up, I'm brushing my teeth, I'm taking a shower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:44.160
I'm having breakfast, there are so many things&nbsp;
that you can say as you're walking around. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:50.000
don't have to say them aloud, you can also say&nbsp;
them in your mind, okay, but try to use the tense&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.400
that you've learned so well right now, okay?
Now, when you feel that you know this tense, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:03.600
you can go on to the next lesson in this series,&nbsp;
because this is a series of the verb tenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:11.760
Next, after that, you can also practice a&nbsp;
little bit more, if you wish, by taking a quiz&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.560
on www.engvid.com . Thanks very much for&nbsp;
watching, and all the best with your English.
&nbsp;

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.880
In this lesson, you will learn the difference&nbsp;
between the present simple tense and the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:29.280
continuous tense, which is also called the&nbsp;
present progressive tense. In other words,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:35.920
you'll learn the difference between&nbsp;
saying "I work" or "I am working". So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:42.160
this lesson is part of a series created by engVid&nbsp;
to help you learn all of the English verb tenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:50.560
Now, I have created lessons on each of these&nbsp;
tenses separately, and maybe you have already&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:56.880
watched them, and now you're watching this, which&nbsp;
is great, or you can watch this lesson and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:03.280
you can go on and watch the other separate lessons&nbsp;
so that you can go into more detail if you wish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:11.680
So, both of these tenses are basic tenses.&nbsp;
However, they don't exist in all languages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:17.360
and maybe they don't exist in your language,&nbsp;
so pay a little more attention and as you do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:25.440
you will understand easily the differences between&nbsp;
these tenses. So, shall we begin? Let's go!
&nbsp;

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:33.840
So, the present simple tense&nbsp;
sounds like this: I work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:43.920
The present continuous tense sounds like this: I&nbsp;
am working. So, what's the very basic difference?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:51.840
The basic difference is that "I am working"&nbsp;
talks about something that's happening right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:52.560 --> 01:31:00.320
or something temporary that happens for&nbsp;
a short time. "I work", present simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:06.480
talks about something that's true in general, or&nbsp;
something more permanent, something that lasts&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:13.040
for a long time. That's the very basic difference,&nbsp;
but we're going to be looking at all of the really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:20.000
specific differences between these two tenses. But&nbsp;
first, let's see, what does this tense even look&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.680
like? What does it sound like? Let's see that.
So, with present simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:36.880
we basically take the subject + the verb.&nbsp;
In this case, our sample verb is "work". So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:43.200
it would sound like this - you can say it after me&nbsp;
if you like. It's good to repeat things out loud,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:51.040
helps you to feel more comfortable and get used&nbsp;
to using it yourself. So, we would say: I work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:53.600 --> 01:32:06.400
You work. We work. They work. But here we have a&nbsp;
difference: He works. We have to add an "s" there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:15.680
She works. It works, okay? Again, once&nbsp;
you've studied this tense in detail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:23.680
you'll know all of these changes perfectly,&nbsp;
but I'm just giving you an overall view. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:32.640
it becomes negative, it becomes "He does&nbsp;
not work.", or, if it becomes a question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:40.560
it would say "Does he work?", alright? So,&nbsp;
that's the basis of the present simple.
&nbsp;

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:46.720
Now, let's look at present continuous.&nbsp;
Now here, what happens? We have a subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:56.160
I, he, you, they, etc., + the verb "to be", we&nbsp;
need that helping verb here, + our basic verb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:04.000
which in this case is "work", + "-ing", so it's&nbsp;
a little bit longer because we have that helping&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:11.680
verb in the middle, plus we have "-ing" at the&nbsp;
end, okay? So, how does this sound? I am working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:28.640
You are working. We are working. They are working.&nbsp;
He is working. She is working. And, it is working,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:39.680
alright? So, that's the basic positive form of it.&nbsp;
The negative form would be just to add a "not".&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:47.920
"You are not working". He is not working. And if&nbsp;
we shorten that, it becomes "He isn't working".&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.000
And if we make it into a&nbsp;
question, change the order,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:52.560 --> 01:34:00.240
we would say "Is he working?" Are you working?&nbsp;
Are they working? And so on, okay? So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:06.320
that's the basic structure of the two tenses, and&nbsp;
next we will be looking at when to use them.
&nbsp;

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:12.880
So, we use these two tenses in different&nbsp;
ways. Let's understand now what they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:21.600
So, in the present simple, we would say, for&nbsp;
example, "I live in this building". This is my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.600
permanent residence. This is where I live&nbsp;
all the time. So, we use present simple:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:34.480
"I live". In present continuous, we&nbsp;
might say "I am staying at a hotel."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:43.280
This is something temporary. It's not all the&nbsp;
time, it's only for some time. So, here, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:51.440
"I am staying", which is present continuous,&nbsp;
here we have "I live", which is present simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:52.320 --> 01:35:01.440
Permanent, temporary. Next, we could say "He&nbsp;
plays the guitar." This is true in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:07.680
It means he knows how to play the&nbsp;
guitar. He plays. Present simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:15.840
Here, we could say "He is playing the&nbsp;
guitar." That means he's doing that right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:24.240
He is playing now. As soon as we say, "He is&nbsp;
playing", even if we don't use the word "now",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:32.800
this tense already means that it's happening&nbsp;
right now, okay? So, he plays in general,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:37.440
but he is playing the guitar&nbsp;
means it's happening right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:48.560
Another example, "We watch the news at 9:00pm."&nbsp;
"We watch", okay? This is to talk about a routine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:56.080
every day we watch the news at 9:00pm.&nbsp;
Alright? So that's to describe a routine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:05.600
something that happens regularly. Or, we could say&nbsp;
here "We are watching the news." "We are watching"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:15.200
means what? In this case again, it's happening&nbsp;
right now, okay? We're watching the news, call&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.520
us later, we're just watching the news, happening&nbsp;
now. But, every day, we watch the news at 9:00,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.560
okay? So that's a routine, that's&nbsp;
again something that's happening now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:35.600
See the difference? Let's look at another one.&nbsp;
"The sun sets in the west." "The sun sets",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.920
okay? The sun rises in the morning, the sun&nbsp;
sets in the evening. This is just a fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:49.760
okay? So, we use present simple to talk&nbsp;
about facts. But, here, we could say "Look,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:56.960
how beautiful, the sun is setting! The sky&nbsp;
is all orange and pink and lovely colors".&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:06.000
So, this means the sun "is setting" means it's&nbsp;
happening right now, alright? So here, it was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.360
fact, the sun sets in the west, it's just a fact,&nbsp;
and here, it's happening now. So, these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:20.480
first few differences between these two tenses.
Now, here are some more differences. In present&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:27.280
simple, we would say "The price rises every&nbsp;
year." This is something that happens in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:36.080
In present continuous, we might say "The&nbsp;
price is rising this year." This is a trend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:44.160
this is the general direction in which things&nbsp;
are changing, so here, the price "is rising"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:51.680
this year, but the price "rises every&nbsp;
year", okay? This is present simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:59.680
Next, suppose we want to talk about a habit.&nbsp;
We might say "She always takes the bus."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:09.600
She always takes - but here, we might say&nbsp;
"She is always complaining about the bus."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:19.040
So, when you're talking about a negative&nbsp;
habit, then we can use present continuous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:25.600
but if you're just talking about a regular&nbsp;
habit, then you would use present simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:34.160
Alright? Next, we could say, in present&nbsp;
simple, "The flight leaves at 7:00pm."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:40.960
Now, why do we use present simple for that?&nbsp;
Because it's a regularly scheduled event,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.960
right? The flight leaves at 7:00pm, that's&nbsp;
the schedule. It always leaves at 7:00pm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:55.520
But in present continuous, we might say "The&nbsp;
flight is leaving." The flight is leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:02.720
means what? The flight is leaving right now,&nbsp;
okay? And we know that because we have "is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:13.360
leaving". Here, we had just "leaves". Okay. And&nbsp;
now here's something where both of these tenses&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:20.000
can actually be used for the same purpose, but&nbsp;
in different ways, with different language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:26.160
So, we could say, for example, even though this&nbsp;
is the present simple, and even though this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:33.680
the present continuous, until now we have been&nbsp;
talking about present uses, but let's look at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:42.960
example, this is different. "The flight leaves at&nbsp;
7:00pm tomorrow." What, Rebecca, really? Leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:49.520
present simple, and tomorrow? Yes, we could&nbsp;
say that, and we do say that sometimes. Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:58.000
Because it's kind of connected with this one&nbsp;
because it's a regularly scheduled event, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:06.080
Then we could use it to talk about tomorrow, okay?&nbsp;
And sometimes we do. So, we could say "The flight&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:13.920
leaves at 7:00pm tomorrow." and it's kind of&nbsp;
connected to this idea of the schedule, alright?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:23.360
But similarly, you could also say "The flight is&nbsp;
leaving at 7:00pm tomorrow." Again, you're saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:28.560
"Rebecca, really, this is present continuous,&nbsp;
why are we using it to talk about the future?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:37.600
Because we can! It has a special use where&nbsp;
we can say - use present continuous to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:46.320
about something in the future but you have to say&nbsp;
something like tomorrow, next week, next Monday,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.840
next year. You have to give the time, because&nbsp;
if you say, "The flight is leaving at 7:00pm.",&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:59.440
what does it mean? It's leaving right now. But&nbsp;
- or, a little bit in the future - but if we say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:05.600
the flight is leaving at 7:00pm tomorrow, then&nbsp;
we know for certain it's in the future and yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:11.680
we can also use present continuous along with&nbsp;
a few other ways to talk about the future.
&nbsp;

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.200
There's one other really important difference&nbsp;
between the present simple tense and the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:25.200
continuous tense, and that has to do with the&nbsp;
kind of verbs we can use with each tense. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:31.840
one way to divide verbs in English is to see&nbsp;
whether it's an action verb or whether it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:41.760
stative verb. An action verb is something that&nbsp;
has action. For example, run or jump, or sing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:49.840
and dance, read and write. These are all action&nbsp;
verbs. And action verbs, we can use in the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:56.400
simple tense and we can also use them in the&nbsp;
present continuous tense. For example, I could say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:05.440
"She runs", as in, she runs every day, or "She&nbsp;
is running", like she's running right now, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:14.320
stative verbs are different. Stative&nbsp;
verbs describe a state or condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:21.760
It could be a mental state, it could be an&nbsp;
emotional state, it could talk about possession,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:29.680
it could talk about certain senses, and there is a&nbsp;
list of stative verbs which you need to learn when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:38.240
you're studying English grammar, because most of&nbsp;
the time, we cannot use the stative verbs in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:46.400
continuous tenses. But, with the present simple,&nbsp;
you can use all the verbs. You can use the action&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:54.080
verbs and you can use stative verbs, no problem,&nbsp;
alright? So, for example, we can definitely say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:02.960
"He knows them." or "We like them.", knowing&nbsp;
being something mental, and like being something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:11.280
emotional, alright? So, with present simple, use&nbsp;
any verb you like. With present continuous, be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.800
careful, definitely you can use the action words,&nbsp;
but if you are not sure about the stative verbs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:22.320
avoid them. As a general rule,&nbsp;
be careful of using any stative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:27.760
verbs with the present continuous tense.
