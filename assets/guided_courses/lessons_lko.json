case you didn't that are rendered in case you didn't that are rendered in case you didn't notice just now notice just now notice just now in three different nadai so this is like in three different nadai so this is like in three different nadai so this is like a multi-nadai a multi-nadai a multi-nadai series and each individual korwai has series and each individual korwai has series and each individual korwai has sections that sections that sections that are in chaturashanarai madhyamakalam are in chaturashanarai madhyamakalam are in chaturashanarai madhyamakalam some some some in tishranadai kirkalam and some in in tishranadai kirkalam and some in in tishranadai kirkalam and some in tisha nadai madimakalam tisha nadai madimakalam tisha nadai madimakalam and those respectively are subdivisions and those respectively are subdivisions and those respectively are subdivisions of of of a beat into 4 3 and 6. a beat into 4 3 and 6. a beat into 4 3 and 6. that is a common way of playing around that is a common way of playing around that is a common way of playing around with with with multiple nadai but of course not the multiple nadai but of course not the multiple nadai but of course not the only one only one only one the length of one individual core y is the length of one individual core y is the length of one individual core y is for avartana for avartana for avartana so this is more on the mid uh so this is more on the mid uh so this is more on the mid uh mid size side of things it's not very mid size side of things it's not very mid size side of things it's not very long but it's not very short either long but it's not very short either long but it's not very short either and today we'll focus on the general and today we'll focus on the general and today we'll focus on the general structure and structure and structure and in particular on the very first corvi of in particular on the very first corvi of in particular on the very first corvi of the series the series the series here is the structure of the first here is the structure of the first here is the structure of the first corvid corvid corvid on the first line we see a phrase we on the first line we see a phrase we on the first line we see a phrase we will call a8 will call a8 will call a8 then a phrase for seven beats the second then a phrase for seven beats the second then a phrase for seven beats the second line is a phrasal called a6 line is a phrasal called a6 line is a phrasal called a6 and then again a frames for seven beat and then again a frames for seven beat and then again a frames for seven beat and f race for and f race for and f race for six beats and then the third line six beats and then the third line six beats and then the third line uh it has a phrase that we called a4 uh it has a phrase that we called a4 uh it has a phrase that we called a4 seven six and five seven six and five seven six and five these three lines make up the purovangam these three lines make up the purovangam these three lines make up the purovangam part part part of the composition and we can see here of the composition and we can see here of the composition and we can see here already some interesting already some interesting already some interesting movements within the purvangam itself movements within the purvangam itself movements within the purvangam itself first we have the reduction first we have the reduction first we have the reduction of the a phrase because those numbers of the a phrase because those numbers of the a phrase because those numbers after the after the after the letter a eight six and four are the letter a eight six and four are the letter a eight six and four are the sizes right the length of these a sizes right the length of these a sizes right the length of these a phrases so that's the very first thing phrases so that's the very first thing phrases so that's the very first thing we see from line to line we see from line to line we see from line to line and the second thing we can observe is and the second thing we can observe is and the second thing we can observe is with the numbers because on the first with the numbers because on the first with the numbers because on the first line we have line we have line we have a number a phrase for seven bits and a number a phrase for seven bits and a number a phrase for seven bits and then on the second line then on the second line then on the second line we see this phrase again but we add to we see this phrase again but we add to we see this phrase again but we add to it it it a variant of that which is slightly a variant of that which is slightly a variant of that which is slightly smaller so we have smaller so we have smaller so we have seven and six and the last line we have seven and six and the last line we have seven and six and the last line we have seven seven seven six and five so we have this addition six and five so we have this addition six and five so we have this addition of increasingly smaller phrases to the of increasingly smaller phrases to the of increasingly smaller phrases to the second part of each line second part of each line second part of each line let's take a look at the second part of let's take a look at the second part of let's take a look at the second part of the corvette which is called the the corvette which is called the the corvette which is called the uttaranga uttaranga uttaranga and here we see only numbers right and and here we see only numbers right and and here we see only numbers right and actually it is the same actually it is the same actually it is the same phrase repeated three times we have phrase repeated three times we have phrase repeated three times we have three three three three three
