the Netherlands is actually ways and the Netherlands is actually ways and the Netherlands is actually very acceptable to heavy rainfall very acceptable to heavy rainfall very acceptable to heavy rainfall causing it to flood and so they've causing it to flood and so they've causing it to flood and so they've created this Delta that allows all the created this Delta that allows all the created this Delta that allows all the flood water together into one space flood water together into one space flood water together into one space almost like a dab so then that way they almost like a dab so then that way they almost like a dab so then that way they have water that they can keep on using have water that they can keep on using have water that they can keep on using for a longer period of

Legg this project actually introduced or donated 10 Goods to each women that was donated 10 Goods to each women that was donated 10 Goods to each women that was actually selected in that project this actually selected in that project this actually selected in that project this then go to another just ordinary goats then go to another just ordinary goats then go to another just ordinary goats they were actually drought resistant they were actually drought resistant they were actually drought resistant goats and in the process these women goats and in the process these women goats and in the process these women were trained how to take care of these were trained how to take care of these were trained how to take care of these goods and in the return they actually goods and in the return they actually goods and in the return they actually benefited a lot they benefited organic benefited a lot they benefited organic benefited a lot they benefited organic manure that they could use to start up manure that they could use to start up manure that they could use to start up Gardens or fertilizers fertilizers Gardens or fertilizers fertilizers Gardens or fertilizers fertilizers that's correct they also benefited the that's correct they also benefited the that's correct they also benefited the goat's milk and they could actually feed goat's milk and they could actually feed goat's milk and they could actually feed their children they benefited the goods their children they benefited the goods their children they benefited the goods with as well yeah so it was actually a with as well yeah so it was actually a with as well yeah so it was actually a success and this is actually done to success and this is actually done to success and this is actually done to curb or to help them adapt that's curb or to help them adapt that's curb or to help them adapt that's correct yeah till you know the weather correct yeah till you know the weather correct yeah till you know the weather changes or what is happening droughts changes or what is happening droughts changes or what is happening droughts that our country is facing yeah because that our country is facing yeah because that our country is facing yeah because if this goes actually multiplies they if this goes actually multiplies they if this goes actually multiplies they will actually benefit this home Village will actually benefit this home Village will actually benefit this home Village in the long run because the whole in the long run because the whole in the long run because the whole village now will be full of drought village now will be full of drought village now will be full of drought resisted goats and in other parts of the resisted goats and in other parts of the resisted goats and in other parts of the countries as well they will adapt to countries as well they will adapt to countries as well they will adapt to that and they will take it for that and they will take it for that and they will take it for themselves yeah because we all know goat themselves yeah because we all know goat themselves yeah because we all know goat meat is lack of midnight you know that's meat is lack of midnight you know that's meat is lack of midnight you know that's Capco but you know you burn it nice nice Capco but you know you burn it nice nice Capco but you know you burn it nice nice but then you know what dbn has been but then you know what dbn has been but then you know what dbn has been doing in Namibia funding a lot of doing in Namibia funding a lot of doing in Namibia funding a lot of projects for renewable energies such as projects for renewable energies such as projects for renewable energies such as the ones that we mentioned in our the ones that we mentioned in our the ones that we mentioned in our previous episode previous episode previous episode the first one yes that has been helped the first one yes that has been helped the first one yes that has been helped by Nam power as well where they're by Nam power as well where they're by Nam power as well where they're looking at renewable you know energy looking at renewable you know energy looking at renewable you know energy With the Wind panels that are close to With the Wind panels that are close to With the Wind panels that are close to luderets so in case you're wondering luderets so in case you're wondering luderets so in case you're wondering what is dbn is Development Bank of what is dbn is Development Bank of what is dbn is Development Bank of Namibia yeah okay sorry if I didn't Namibia yeah okay sorry if I didn't Namibia yeah okay sorry if I didn't mention that yeah and then not only that mention that yeah and then not only that mention that yeah and then not only that the whole country is busy and we are the whole country is busy and we are the whole country is busy and we are talking about renewable energy which is talking about renewable energy which is talking about renewable energy which is actually the green hydrogen yes and this actually the green hydrogen yes and this actually the green hydrogen yes and this is actually what we are looking forward is actually what we are looking forward is actually what we are looking forward to because we are thinking that it will to because we are thinking that it will to because we are thinking that it will be very good for us as we are go as it's be very good for us as we are go as it's be very good for us as we are go as it's going to help us to adapt to climate going to help us to adapt to climate going to help us to adapt to climate change exactly and the green hydrogen change exactly and the green hydrogen change exactly and the green hydrogen conference was last week so make sure conference was last week so make sure conference was last week so make sure that you are reading up about what our that you are reading up about what our that you are reading up about what our country is busy planning on implementing country is busy planning on implementing country is busy planning on implementing to make sure that we are adapting and to make sure that we are adapting and to make sure that we are adapting and that we are resilient to the changes that we are resilient to the changes that we are resilient to the changes because as we mentioned also in our because as we mentioned also in our because as we mentioned also in our previous episodes what has been previous episodes what has been previous episodes what has been happening we faced severe drought every happening we faced severe drought every happening we faced severe drought every second year and then the flooding that second year and then the flooding that second year and then the flooding that happens when we ex when we receive happens when we ex when we receive happens when we ex when we receive unexpected rainfalls and that's why it unexpected rainfalls and that's why it unexpected rainfalls and that's why it is very important for our country and is very important for our country and is very important for our country and our communities us our communities us our communities us to help our country sustain and adapt to to help our country sustain and adapt to to help our country sustain and adapt to you know the ever-changing weather you know the ever-changing weather you know the ever-changing weather patterns just to add on that the patterns just to add on that the patterns just to add on that the government and local authorities are government and local authorities are government and local authorities are really trying hard they are Distributing really trying hard they are Distributing really trying hard they are Distributing seeds which are drug resistance wow and seeds which are drug resistance wow and seeds which are drug resistance wow and this is actually helping us to adapt to this is actually helping us to adapt to this is actually helping us to adapt to climate change because we have to look climate change because we have to look climate change because we have to look at new ways of farming and you know at new ways of farming and you know at new ways of farming and you know measures that we could introduce but you measures that we could introduce but you measures that we could introduce but you know it's it's still a talk in progress know it's it's still a talk in progress know it's it's still a talk in progress It's either looking at farming pigs It's either looking at farming pigs It's either looking at farming pigs because as we all know pigs eat a lot of because as we all know pigs eat a lot of because as we all know pigs eat a lot of you know everything that is around them you know everything that is around them you know everything that is around them whatever it's available most of the time whatever it's available most of the time whatever it's available most of the time yeah and then we could look at a new yeah and then we could look at a new yeah and then we could look at a new product that Namibia could be exporting product that Namibia could be exporting product that Namibia could be exporting as well we could have bacon and pork as well we could have bacon and pork as well we could have bacon and pork instead of importing it we could now instead of importing it we could now instead of importing it we could now become the ones that produce it and become the ones that produce it and become the ones that produce it and Export it Export it Export it [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] hello and welcome back

beautiful woman please introduce beautiful woman please introduce yourself thank you very much for having yourself thank you very much for having yourself thank you very much for having me on your show here today my name is me on your show here today my name is me on your show here today my name is Priscilla mondillo I am an Priscilla mondillo I am an Priscilla mondillo I am an agri-environmental engineer by agri-environmental engineer by agri-environmental engineer by profession but I work in Development profession but I work in Development profession but I work in Development Corporation primarily in natural Corporation primarily in natural Corporation primarily in natural resource management projects with a resource management projects with a resource management projects with a focus on climate change well what a focus on climate change well what a focus on climate change well what a beautiful introduction but now let's beautiful introduction but now let's beautiful introduction but now let's jump into some questions that we have jump into some questions that we have jump into some questions that we have for you today for you today for you today um Priscilla would you please briefly um Priscilla would you please briefly um Priscilla would you please briefly explain to us what is climate change explain to us what is climate change explain to us what is climate change adaptation and resilience yes a very adaptation and resilience yes a very adaptation and resilience yes a very good way to start this discussion is to good way to start this discussion is to good way to start this discussion is to of course outline some of these key of course outline some of these key of course outline some of these key terms will be using as we go along in terms will be using as we go along in terms will be using as we go along in our discussion so firstly climate change our discussion so firstly climate change our discussion so firstly climate change adaptation is really the measures and adaptation is really the measures and adaptation is really the measures and the actions that we as individuals as a the actions that we as individuals as a the actions that we as individuals as a community as a nation take to reduce the community as a nation take to reduce the community as a nation take to reduce the negative impact of climate change while negative impact of climate change while negative impact of climate change while on the other hand resilience climate on the other hand resilience climate on the other hand resilience climate resilience really means our ability or resilience really means our ability or resilience really means our ability or our capacity to cope in terms of the the our capacity to cope in terms of the the our capacity to cope in terms of the the negative impacts of climate change when negative impacts of climate change when negative impacts of climate change when we are sort of faced with a catastrophic we are sort of faced with a catastrophic we are sort of faced with a catastrophic climatic event so that's really a climatic event so that's really a climatic event so that's really a distinguishing factor between the two distinguishing factor between the two distinguishing factor between the two terms okay terms okay terms okay which adaptation and resilience measures which adaptation and resilience measures which adaptation and resilience measures has Namibia started taking and or has has Namibia started taking and or has has Namibia started taking and or has put in place that's a very important put in place that's a very important put in place that's a very important question because as you know Namibia is question because as you know Namibia is question because as you know Namibia is the driest country south of the the driest country south of the the driest country south of the sub-sahara and our economy is heavily sub-sahara and our economy is heavily sub-sahara and our economy is heavily heavily dependent on natural resources heavily dependent on natural resources heavily dependent on natural resources especially in terms of our Marine especially in terms of our Marine especially in terms of our Marine Resources our agriculture as well as Resources our agriculture as well as Resources our agriculture as well as nature-based tourism but at the same nature-based tourism but at the same nature-based tourism but at the same time you know our natural resources are time you know our natural resources are time you know our natural resources are faced with a lot of challenges and and faced with a lot of challenges and and faced with a lot of challenges and and this of course increases the this of course increases the this of course increases the vulnerability of our adaptive capacity vulnerability of our adaptive capacity vulnerability of our adaptive capacity our some of the challenges that we are our some of the challenges that we are our some of the challenges that we are faced with is population growth we have faced with is population growth we have faced with is population growth we have a high rural urban migration and then we a high rural urban migration and then we a high rural urban migration and then we also have poverty which has you know also have poverty which has you know also have poverty which has you know permanently permanently permanently manifested itself especially in the manifested itself especially in the manifested itself especially in the rural areas rural areas rural areas yeah and in terms of also our adaptive yeah and in terms of also our adaptive yeah and in terms of also our adaptive capacity we are really faced with you capacity we are really faced with you capacity we are really faced with you know lack of skills and technological know lack of skills and technological know lack of skills and technological transfers within the country but at the transfers within the country but at the transfers within the country but at the same time you know the country has been same time you know the country has been same time you know the country has been doing quite a lot in terms of climate doing quite a lot in terms of climate doing quite a lot in terms of climate change adaptation we have we are change adaptation we have we are change adaptation we have we are currently developing our national currently developing our national currently developing our national adaptation plan adaptation plan adaptation plan and this plan really outlines our long and this plan really outlines our long and this plan really outlines our long to medium-term actions in terms of to medium-term actions in terms of to medium-term actions in terms of adaptation that we as a country are adaptation that we as a country are adaptation that we as a country are planning to take and as well linking it planning to take and as well linking it planning to take and as well linking it to some financing Windows because as we to some financing Windows because as we to some financing Windows because as we know adaptation can be quite costly but know adaptation can be quite costly but know adaptation can be quite costly but at the same time in terms of practical at the same time in terms of practical at the same time in terms of practical measures we all know that Namibia is a measures we all know that Namibia is a measures we all know that Namibia is a party to uh the the Paris agreement and party to uh the the Paris agreement and party to uh the the Paris agreement and we have sort of submitted our intended we have sort of submitted our intended we have sort of submitted our intended nationally determined contributions to nationally determined contributions to nationally determined contributions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as well as to adapt to climate change and well as to adapt to climate change and well as to adapt to climate change and some of the measures that we have some of the measures that we have some of the measures that we have outlined here that we've already started outlined here that we've already started outlined here that we've already started working on really is our early warning working on really is our early warning working on really is our early warning systems for commercial as well as for systems for commercial as well as for systems for commercial as well as for communal Farmers developing rain water communal Farmers

resilient infrastructure climate resilient infrastructure climate resilient infrastructure especially in your flat-borne areas uh especially in your flat-borne areas uh especially in your flat-borne areas uh as you've mentioned earlier on uh if as you've mentioned earlier on uh if as you've mentioned earlier on uh if you're faced it with a flood is your you're faced it with a flood is your you're faced it with a flood is your house actually resilient uh to withstand house actually resilient uh to withstand house actually resilient uh to withstand some of these uh the floods so I think some of these uh the floods so I think some of these uh the floods so I think those are some of the measures that those are some of the measures that those are some of the measures that we've been looking into and in terms of we've been looking into and in terms of we've been looking into and in terms of legislation we are also looking at and legislation we are also looking at and legislation we are also looking at and acting a legislation that prohibits you acting a legislation that prohibits you acting a legislation that prohibits you know private people or anyone to really know private people or anyone to really know private people or anyone to really build in a climate sensitive areas build in a climate sensitive areas build in a climate sensitive areas especially along the coastal areas where especially along the coastal areas where especially along the coastal areas where we see an increase in the sea level rise we see an increase in the sea level rise we see an increase in the sea level rise so I think those are some of the so I think those are some of the so I think those are some of the measures that we have as a country being measures that we have as a country being measures that we have as a country being looking into in terms of adaptation so looking into in terms of adaptation so looking into in terms of adaptation so what are the possible mitigation what are the possible mitigation what are the possible mitigation measures in Namibia to reduce climate measures in Namibia to reduce climate measures in Namibia to reduce climate change now that's a very important change now that's a very important change now that's a very important question and I think it's also important question and I think it's also important question and I think it's also important for us to Define what mitigation for us to Define what mitigation for us to Define what mitigation actually means mitigation is really our actually means mitigation is really our actually means mitigation is really our efforts that we take as individuals as efforts that we take as individuals as efforts that we take as individuals as Community as the country take to reduce Community as the country take to reduce Community as the country take to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as I've our greenhouse gas emissions as I've our greenhouse gas emissions as I've mentioned earlier we are party to the to mentioned earlier we are party to the to mentioned earlier we are party to the to the to the Paris agreement we have the to the Paris agreement we have the to the Paris agreement we have submitted our nationally determined submitted our nationally determined submitted our nationally determined contributions and we sort of set a contributions and we sort of set a contributions and we sort of set a target for ourselves to reduce our target for ourselves to reduce our target for ourselves to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by the year greenhouse gas emissions by the year greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030. now in terms of some of the 2030. now in terms of some of the 2030. now in terms of some of the measures that we as a country has been measures that we as a country has been measures that we as a country has been looking into under this main policy looking into under this main policy looking into under this main policy document is to set up concentrated solar document is to set up concentrated solar document is to set up concentrated solar Farms of concentrated solar power plants Farms of concentrated solar power plants Farms of concentrated solar power plants to really to really to really implore us to move from burning fossil implore us to move from burning fossil implore us to move from burning fossil fuels into using renewable energies fuels into using renewable energies fuels into using renewable energies we are also looking at converting our we are also looking at converting our we are also looking at converting our heavy and and light vehicles from uh heavy and and light vehicles from uh heavy and and light vehicles from uh from from burning fossil fuels into from from burning fossil fuels into from from burning fossil fuels into using nitrogen and this is also the using nitrogen and this is also the using nitrogen and this is also the concept of green hydrogen concept of green hydrogen concept of green hydrogen um we are looking at uh plans to come up um we are looking at uh plans to come up um we are looking at uh plans to come up with a mass transportation system within with a mass transportation system within with a mass transportation system within the country to reduce you know the country to reduce you know the country to reduce you know individual car usage exactly and then individual car usage exactly and then individual car usage exactly and then we're also looking at other areas where we're also looking at other areas where we're also looking at other areas where we could have carbon sinks such as the we could have carbon sinks such as the we could have carbon sinks such as the the forestry sector where we are looking the forestry sector where we are looking the forestry sector where we are looking at aforestation as well as reforestation at aforestation as well as reforestation at aforestation as well as reforestation for our younger users I think it's for our younger users I think it's for our younger users I think it's important for us to also distinguish important for us to also distinguish important for us to also distinguish between what reforestation and between what reforestation and between what reforestation and afforestation means a reforestation is afforestation means a reforestation is afforestation means a reforestation is US introducing forests where they used US introducing forests where they used US introducing forests where they used to be forests but the forest had been to be forests but the forest had been to be forests but the forest had been cleared out due to you know people cleared out due to you know people cleared out due to you know people settling in these areas but at the same settling in these areas but at the same settling in these areas but at the same time we're also looking at aforestation time we're also looking at aforestation time we're also looking at aforestation where we are looking at putting up where we are looking at putting up where we are looking at putting up forests at places where there were never forests at places where there were never forests at places where there were never any forests yeah okay so those are some any forests yeah okay so those are some any forests yeah okay so those are some of the areas that you've been looking of the areas that you've been looking of the areas that you've been looking into in terms of the forestry area in into in terms of the forestry area in into in terms of the forestry area in terms of the green hydrogen and energy terms of the green hydrogen and energy terms of the green hydrogen and energy sector but also in terms of waste we sector but also in terms of waste we sector but also in terms of waste we have also committed to at least reduce have also committed to at least reduce have also committed to at least reduce 50 percent of our waste to energy 50 percent of our waste to energy 50 percent of our waste to energy um and and compost especially at our um and and compost especially at our um and and compost especially at our landfills and we are running out of landfills and we are running out of landfills and we are running out of space to actually space to actually space to actually not necessarily a house but like to dump not necessarily a house but like to dump not necessarily a house but like to dump the dub oh yeah the dub oh yeah the dub oh yeah yeah so we're running out of space to yeah so we're running out of space to yeah so we're running out of space to dump our ways so it's really becoming a dump our ways so it's really becoming a dump our ways so it's really becoming a challenge for us waste is a problem for challenge for us waste is a problem for challenge for us waste is a problem for us in the country so those are some of us in the country so those are some of us in the country so those are some of the measures that we've been looking the measures that we've been looking the measures that we've been looking into in terms of mitigation thank you into in terms of mitigation thank you into in terms of mitigation thank you there you've heard it from her but what there you've heard it from her but what there you've heard it from her but what do you think do you think Namibia is do you think do you think Namibia is do you think do you think Namibia is combating progressing and combating combating progressing and combating combating progressing and combating climate change yes indeed I I do think climate change yes indeed I I do think climate change yes indeed I I do think Namibia has progressed very well in Namibia has progressed very well in Namibia has progressed very well in terms of combating climate change and I terms of combating climate change and I terms of combating climate change and I think we've started you know a long time think we've started you know a long time think we've started you know a long time ago for instance in 2001 we have already ago for instance in 2001 we have already ago for instance in 2001 we have already established a National Climate Change established a National Climate Change established a National Climate Change committee wow 2001. yes it's been a long committee wow 2001. yes it's been a long committee wow 2001. yes it's been a long time a long time yeah so we've already time a long time yeah so we've already time a long time yeah so we've already established our climate change committee established our climate change committee established our climate change committee by then this comedy is basically by then this comedy is basically by then this comedy is basically responsible to advise government on responsible to advise government on responsible to advise government on climate change issues in 2011 we have climate change issues in 2011 we have climate change issues in 2011 we have promulgated our national climate change promulgated our national climate change promulgated our national climate change policy in 2013 team we have also policy in 2013 team we have also policy in 2013 team we have also developed our national climate change developed our national climate change developed our national climate change action plan and strategy from 2013 to action plan and strategy from 2013 to action plan and strategy from 2013 to 2020 and then in between there of course 2020 and then in between there of course 2020 and then in between there of course we've also you know became signatory to we've also you know became signatory to we've also you know became signatory to the Paris agreement where we have sort the Paris agreement where we have sort the Paris agreement where we have sort of as a country shown our commitment uh of as a country shown our commitment uh of as a country shown our commitment uh in combating the negative impacts of in combating the negative impacts of in combating the negative impacts of climate change climate change climate change and at the same time we're also in and at the same time we're also in and at the same time we're also in progress of developing our nationally progress of developing our nationally progress of developing our nationally determined contribution implementation determined contribution implementation determined contribution implementation strategy this is of course going to be strategy this is of course going to be strategy this is of course going to be used as a tool for coordinating and used as a tool for coordinating and used as a tool for coordinating and mobilizing resources from now up until mobilizing resources from now up until mobilizing resources from now up until the year 2030. yes so and I think it's the year 2030. yes so and I think it's the year 2030. yes so and I think it's also important to mention that you know also important to mention that you know also important to mention that you know all of these policies that are mentioned all of these policies that are mentioned all of these policies that are mentioned in here are Guided by our national in here are Guided by our national in here are Guided by our national development goals for instance our development goals for instance our development goals for instance our national development plans our vision national development plans our vision national development plans our vision 2030 as well as our harambe prosperity 2030 as well as our harambe prosperity 2030 as well as our harambe prosperity plan so this uh legislation is really plan so this uh legislation is really plan so this uh legislation is really not in isolation but they really form not in isolation but they really form not in isolation but they really form part of our national our national plans part of our national our national plans part of our national our national plans but at the same time I think in terms of but at the same time I think in terms of but at the same time I think in terms of what we can still do as a country what we can still do as a country what we can still do as a country of course with anything comes challenges of course with anything comes challenges of course with anything comes challenges you know so I think in in terms of you you know so I think in in terms of you you know so I think in in terms of you know combating climate change it's know combating climate change it's know combating climate change it's important that we as a country still important that we as a country still important that we as a country still develop our skills and our capacities develop our skills and our capacities develop our skills and our capacities and ensure that you know our and ensure that you know our and ensure that you know our Technologies are improved to ensure that Technologies are improved to ensure that Technologies are improved to ensure that we are able to combat climate change we are able to combat climate change we are able to combat climate change much more effectively and efficiently much more effectively and efficiently much more effectively and efficiently yes that has brought us to the end of yes that has brought us to the end of yes that has brought us to the end of this wonderful interview don't

working so hard on doing actually working so hard on doing research they are doing research on the research they are doing research on the research they are doing research on the adaptation measures like as I have said adaptation measures like as I have said adaptation measures like as I have said earlier the patient measures of China or earlier the patient measures of China or earlier the patient measures of China or Philippines cannot be the same as ours Philippines cannot be the same as ours Philippines cannot be the same as ours adaptation measures have actually to be adaptation measures have actually to be adaptation measures have actually to be different from places to another as well different from places to another as well different from places to another as well as from

youth Enviro show [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome back if you have been following welcome back if you have been following welcome back if you have been following our previous shows we have been speaking our previous shows we have been speaking our previous shows we have been speaking about climate change climate change and about climate change climate change and about climate change climate change and migration climate change and human migration climate change and human migration climate change and human rights and even though we don't know rights and even though we don't know rights and even though we don't know what climate change will be like in the what climate change will be like in the what climate change will be like in the future at least we have enough future at least we have enough future at least we have enough information to act on it that's correct information to act on it that's correct information to act on it that's correct because even though we know about these because even though we know about these because even though we know about these effects we still need to identify the effects we still need to identify the effects we still need to identify the solutions the adaptations the resilience solutions the adaptations the resilience solutions the adaptations the resilience yes and that's brought us to today's yes and that's brought us to today's yes and that's brought us to today's topic climate change adaptation and topic climate change adaptation and topic climate change adaptation and resilience yes and you know that resilience yes and you know that resilience yes and you know that actually countries already in the world actually countries already in the world actually countries already in the world have come together finding ways have come together finding ways have come together finding ways solutional ways for their communities to solutional ways for their communities to solutional ways for their communities to adapt and be resilient because of the adapt and be resilient because of the adapt and be resilient because of the effects of climate change has had on effects of climate change has had on effects of climate change has had on them remember we cannot change or them remember we cannot change or them remember we cannot change or reverse climate change however we can reverse climate change however we can reverse climate change however we can find Solutions and adaptations to be find Solutions and adaptations to be find Solutions and adaptations to be able to curb climate change yes and able to curb climate change yes and able to curb climate change yes and mentioning on that as I've said mentioning on that as I've said mentioning on that as I've said countries do you know that in 2020 the countries do you know that in 2020 the countries do you know that in 2020 the United Nations actually created a body United Nations actually created a body United Nations actually created a body that's called the adaptation Committee that's called the adaptation Committee that's called the adaptation Committee of countries all over the world where of countries all over the world where of countries all over the world where they come together finding reasonable they come together finding reasonable they come together finding reasonable solutions for each and every country on solutions for each and every country on solutions for each and every country on how they can adapt and be resilient how they can adapt and be resilient how they can adapt and be resilient within their countries and to mention within their countries and to mention within their countries and to mention that Netherlands has actually started that Netherlands has actually started that Netherlands has actually started the Delta program now if you know Delta the Delta program now if you know Delta the Delta program now if you know Delta is when a river spreads out into five is when a river spreads out into five is when a river spreads out into five ways and the Netherlands is actually ways and the Netherlands is actually ways and the Netherlands is actually very acceptable to heavy rainfall very acceptable to heavy rainfall very acceptable to heavy rainfall causing it to flood and so they've causing it to flood and so they've causing it to flood and so they've created this Delta that allows all the created this Delta that allows all the created this Delta that allows all the flood water together into one space flood water together into one space flood water together into one space almost like a dab so then that way they almost like a dab so then that way they almost like a dab so then that way they have water that they can keep on using have water that they can keep on using have water that they can keep on using for a longer period of time so which for a longer period of time so which for a longer period of time so which means that they have changed the way of means that they have changed the way of means that they have changed the way of how water is being channeled yes exactly how water is being channeled yes exactly how water is being channeled yes exactly talking about Philippines for example it talking about Philippines for example it talking about Philippines for example it is actually one of the country that has is actually one of the country that has is actually one of the country that has been really really affected by climate been really really affected by climate been really really affected by climate change when it comes to typhons when it change when it comes to typhons when it change when it comes to typhons when it comes to Drought when it comes to comes to Drought when it comes to comes to Drought when it comes to temperature rises earthquake exactly temperature rises earthquake exactly temperature rises earthquake exactly floodings and drought actually a lot is floodings and drought actually a lot is floodings and drought actually a lot is happening there in the Philippines happening there in the Philippines happening there in the Philippines however the government was actually however the government was actually however the government was actually introduced to developmental goals that introduced to developmental goals that introduced to developmental goals that will help to adapt to climate change will help to adapt to climate change will help to adapt to climate change they needed to come up with projects they needed to come up with projects they needed to come up with projects that could help that specific country that could help that specific country that could help that specific country which is the Philippines to come up with which is the Philippines to come up with which is the Philippines to come up with an adaptation plans and forms of an adaptation plans and forms of an adaptation plans and forms of resilience yes but before we give you resilience yes but before we give you resilience yes but before we give you more examples of what countries have more examples of what countries have more examples of what countries have done let us talk about what adaptation done let us talk about what adaptation done let us talk about what adaptation and resilience actually means and and resilience actually means and and resilience actually means and entails climate adaptation essentially entails climate adaptation essentially entails climate adaptation essentially means any measure that protects a means any measure that protects a means any measure that protects a community or ecosystem from the effect community or ecosystem from the effect community or ecosystem from the effect of climate change while also building of climate change while also building of climate change while also building long-term resilience to avoid long-term resilience to avoid long-term resilience to avoid environmental conditions remember environmental conditions remember environmental conditions remember adaptation is open-ended and takes many adaptation is open-ended and takes many adaptation is open-ended and takes many forms in Africa countries such as forms in Africa countries such as forms in Africa countries such as Senegal there is actually a village Senegal there is actually a village Senegal there is actually a village called podo whereby capacity building called podo whereby capacity building called podo whereby capacity building was actually introduced the women were was actually introduced the women were was actually introduced the women were actually trained on how to raise actually trained on how to raise actually trained on how to raise nurseries on how to plant seeds they nurseries on how to plant seeds they nurseries on how to plant seeds they have turned a drought desert village have turned a drought desert village have turned a drought desert village into an agroforestry place this means into an agroforestry place this means into an agroforestry place this means that they were actually introduced to that they were actually introduced to that they were actually introduced to nazaries they were planting many trees nazaries they were planting many trees nazaries they were planting many trees and it actually turned out to be a and it actually turned out to be a and it actually turned out to be a success because as these trees were success because as these trees were success because as these trees were growing the ecosystem was restored as growing the ecosystem was restored as growing the ecosystem was restored as well as many many plenty of biodiversity well as many many plenty of biodiversity well as many many plenty of biodiversity was actually coming forth be because the was actually coming forth be because the was actually coming forth be because the whole area was just green wow you know whole area was just green wow you know whole area was just green wow you know this is definitely an Innovative way and this is definitely an Innovative way and this is definitely an Innovative way and a new way of farming that we have to a new way of farming that we have to a new way of farming that we have to look at and that is what climate look at and that is what climate look at and that is what climate adaptation is looking at new ways of adaptation is looking at new ways of adaptation is looking at new ways of farming and better technologies that we farming and better technologies that we farming and better technologies that we can predict the weather to help the can predict the weather to help the can predict the weather to help the people that are affected by Cyclones people that are affected by Cyclones people that are affected by Cyclones typhoons and also finding sustainable typhoons and also finding sustainable typhoons and also finding sustainable ways on how you can store water that we ways on how you can store water that we ways on how you can store water that we already have yes just to add to that in already have yes just to add to that in already have yes just to add to that in Senegal again they were not only Senegal again they were not only Senegal again they were not only introduced to nurseries which are just introduced to nurseries which are just introduced to nurseries which are just random plants they were actually random plants they were actually random plants they were actually introduced to more like to grow introduced to more like to grow introduced to more like to grow vegetables that could actually survive vegetables that could actually survive vegetables that could actually survive in that conditions wow and it was really in that conditions wow and it was really in that conditions wow and it was really a success well if we think about our own a success well if we think about our own a success well if we think about our own country as well we know that Namibia is country as well we know that Namibia is country as well we know that Namibia is pushing it's yo it's pushing its best pushing it's yo it's pushing its best pushing it's yo it's pushing its best for adaptation waves it's really really for adaptation waves it's really really for adaptation waves it's really really pushing and it's moving forward for pushing and it's moving forward for pushing and it's moving forward for example in kunene region there is a example in kunene region there is a example in kunene region there is a project coordinated by undp and danila project coordinated by undp and danila project coordinated by undp and danila Legg this project actually introduced or Legg this project actually introduced or Legg this project actually introduced or donated 10 Goods to each women that was donated 10 Goods to each women that was donated 10 Goods to each women that was actually selected in that project this actually selected in that project this actually selected in that project this then go to another just ordinary goats then go to another just ordinary goats then go to another just ordinary goats they were actually drought resistant they were actually drought resistant they were actually drought resistant goats and in the process these women goats and in the process these women goats and in the process these women were trained how to take care of these were trained how to take care of these were trained how to take care of these goods and in the return they actually goods and in the return they actually goods and in the return they actually benefited a lot they benefited organic benefited a lot they benefited organic benefited a lot they benefited organic manure that they could use to start up manure that they could use to start up manure that they could use to start up Gardens or fertilizers fertilizers Gardens or fertilizers fertilizers Gardens or fertilizers fertilizers that's correct they also benefited the that's correct they also benefited the that's correct they also benefited the goat's milk and they could actually feed goat's milk and they could actually feed goat's milk and they could actually feed their children they benefited the goods their children they benefited the goods their children they benefited the goods with as well yeah so it was actually a with as well yeah so it was actually a with as well yeah so it was actually a success and this is actually done to success and this is actually done to success and this is actually done to curb or to help them adapt that's curb or to help them adapt that's curb or to help them adapt that's correct yeah till you know the weather correct yeah till you know the weather correct yeah till you know the weather changes or what is happening droughts changes or what is happening droughts changes or what is happening droughts that our country is facing yeah because that our country is facing yeah because that our country is facing yeah because if this goes actually multiplies they if this goes actually multiplies they if this goes actually multiplies they will actually benefit this home Village will actually benefit this home Village will actually benefit this home Village in the long run because the whole in the long run because the whole in the long run because the whole village now will be full of drought village now will be full of drought village now will be full of drought resisted goats and in other parts of the resisted goats and in other parts of the resisted goats and in other parts of the countries as well they will adapt to countries as well they will adapt to countries as well they will adapt to that and they will take it for that and they will take it for that and they will take it for themselves yeah because we all know goat themselves yeah because we all know goat themselves yeah because we all know goat meat is lack of midnight you know that's meat is lack of midnight you know that's meat is lack of midnight you know that's Capco but you know you burn it nice nice Capco but you know you burn it nice nice Capco but you know you burn it nice nice but then you know what dbn has been but then you know what dbn has been but then you know what dbn has been doing in Namibia funding a lot of doing in Namibia funding a lot of doing in Namibia funding a lot of projects for renewable energies such as projects for renewable energies such as projects for renewable energies such as the ones that we mentioned in our the ones that we mentioned in our the ones that we mentioned in our previous episode previous episode previous episode the first one yes that has been helped the first one yes that has been helped the first one yes that has been helped by Nam power as well where they're by Nam power as well where they're by Nam power as well where they're looking at renewable you know energy looking at renewable you know energy looking at renewable you know energy With the Wind panels that are close to With the Wind panels that are close to With the Wind panels that are close to luderets so in case you're wondering luderets so in case you're wondering luderets so in case you're wondering what is dbn is Development Bank of what is dbn is Development Bank of what is dbn is Development Bank of Namibia yeah okay sorry if I didn't Namibia yeah okay sorry if I didn't Namibia yeah okay sorry if I didn't mention that yeah and then not only that mention that yeah and then not only that mention that yeah and then not only that the whole country is busy and we are the whole country is busy and we are the whole country is busy and we are talking about renewable energy which is talking about renewable energy which is talking about renewable energy which is actually the green hydrogen yes and this actually the green hydrogen yes and this actually the green hydrogen yes and this is actually what we are looking forward is actually what we are looking forward is actually what we are looking forward to because we are thinking that it will to because we are thinking that it will to because we are thinking that it will be very good for us as we are go as it's be very good for us as we are go as it's be very good for us as we are go as it's going to help us to adapt to climate going to help us to adapt to climate going to help us to adapt to climate change exactly and the green hydrogen change exactly and the green hydrogen change exactly and the green hydrogen conference was last week so make sure conference was last week so make sure conference was last week so make sure that you are reading up about what our that you are reading up about what our that you are reading up about what our country is busy planning on implementing country is busy planning on implementing country is busy planning on implementing to make sure that we are adapting and to make sure that we are adapting and to make sure that we are adapting and that we are resilient to the changes that we are resilient to the changes that we are resilient to the changes because as we mentioned also in our because as we mentioned also in our because as we mentioned also in our previous episodes what has been previous episodes what has been previous episodes what has been happening we faced severe drought every happening we faced severe drought every happening we faced severe drought every second year and then the flooding that second year and then the flooding that second year and then the flooding that happens when we ex when we receive happens when we ex when we receive happens when we ex when we receive unexpected rainfalls and that's why it unexpected rainfalls and that's why it unexpected rainfalls and that's why it is very important for our country and is very important for our country and is very important for our country and our communities us our communities us our communities us to help our country sustain and adapt to to help our country sustain and adapt to to help our country sustain and adapt to you know the ever-changing weather you know the ever-changing weather you know the ever-changing weather patterns just to add on that the patterns just to add on that the patterns just to add on that the government and local authorities are government and local authorities are government and local authorities are really trying hard they are Distributing really trying hard they are Distributing really trying hard they are Distributing seeds which are drug resistance wow and seeds which are drug resistance wow and seeds which are drug resistance wow and this is actually helping us to adapt to this is actually helping us to adapt to this is actually helping us to adapt to climate change because we have to look climate change because we have to look climate change because we have to look at new ways of farming and you know at new ways of farming and you know at new ways of farming and you know measures that we could introduce but you measures that we could introduce but you measures that we could introduce but you know it's it's still a talk in progress know it's it's still a talk in progress know it's it's still a talk in progress It's either looking at farming pigs It's either looking at farming pigs It's either looking at farming pigs because as we all know pigs eat a lot of because as we all know pigs eat a lot of because as we all know pigs eat a lot of you know everything that is around them you know everything that is around them you know everything that is around them whatever it's available most of the time whatever it's available most of the time whatever it's available most of the time yeah and then we could look at a new yeah and then we could look at a new yeah and then we could look at a new product that Namibia could be exporting product that Namibia could be exporting product that Namibia could be exporting as well we could have bacon and pork as well we could have bacon and pork as well we could have bacon and pork instead of importing it we could now instead of importing it we could now instead of importing it we could now become the ones that produce it and become the ones that produce it and become the ones that produce it and Export it Export it Export it [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign

are joined by this beautiful woman please introduce beautiful woman please introduce beautiful woman please introduce yourself thank you very much for having yourself thank you very much for having yourself thank you very much for having me on your show here today my name is me on your show here today my name is me on your show here today my name is Priscilla mondillo I am an Priscilla mondillo I am an Priscilla mondillo I am an agri-environmental engineer by agri-environmental engineer by agri-environmental engineer by profession but I work in Development profession but I work in Development profession but I work in Development Corporation primarily in natural Corporation primarily in natural Corporation primarily in natural resource management projects with a resource management projects with a resource management projects with a focus on climate change well what a focus on climate change well what a focus on climate change well what a beautiful introduction but now let's beautiful introduction but now let's beautiful introduction but now let's jump into some questions that we have jump into some questions that we have jump into some questions that we have for you today for you today for you today um Priscilla would you please briefly um Priscilla would you please briefly um Priscilla would you please briefly explain to us what is climate change explain to us what is climate change explain to us what is climate change adaptation and resilience yes a very adaptation and resilience yes a very adaptation and resilience yes a very good way to start this discussion is to good way to start this discussion is to good way to start this discussion is to of course outline some of these key of course outline some of these key of course outline some of these key terms will be using as we go along in terms will be using as we go along in terms will be using as we go along in our discussion so firstly climate change our discussion so firstly climate change our discussion so firstly climate change adaptation is really the measures and adaptation is really the measures and adaptation is really the measures and the actions that we as individuals as a the actions that we as individuals as a the actions that we as individuals as a community as a nation take to reduce the community as a nation take to reduce the community as a nation take to reduce the negative impact of climate change while negative impact of climate change while negative impact of climate change while on the other hand resilience climate on the other hand resilience climate on the other hand resilience climate resilience really means our ability or resilience really means our ability or resilience really means our ability or our capacity to cope in terms of the the our capacity to cope in terms of the the our capacity to cope in terms of the the negative impacts of climate change when negative impacts of climate change when negative impacts of climate change when we are sort of faced with a catastrophic we are sort of faced with a catastrophic we are sort of faced with a catastrophic climatic event so that's really a climatic event so that's really a climatic event so that's really a distinguishing factor between the two distinguishing factor between the two distinguishing factor between the two terms okay terms okay terms okay which adaptation and resilience measures which adaptation and resilience measures which adaptation and resilience measures has Namibia started taking and or has has Namibia started taking and or has has Namibia started taking and or has put in place that's a very important put in place that's a very important put in place that's a very important question because as you know Namibia is question because as you know Namibia is question because as you know Namibia is the driest country south of the the driest country south of the the driest country south of the sub-sahara and our economy is heavily sub-sahara and our economy is heavily sub-sahara and our economy is heavily heavily dependent on natural resources heavily dependent on natural resources heavily dependent on natural resources especially in terms of our Marine especially in terms of our Marine especially in terms of our Marine Resources our agriculture as well as Resources our agriculture as well as Resources our agriculture as well as nature-based tourism but at the same nature-based tourism but at the same nature-based tourism but at the same time you know our natural resources are time you know our natural resources are time you know our natural resources are faced with a lot of challenges and and faced with a lot of challenges and and faced with a lot of challenges and and this of course increases the this of course increases the this of course increases the vulnerability of our adaptive capacity vulnerability of our adaptive capacity vulnerability of our adaptive capacity our some of the challenges that we are our some of the challenges that we are our some of the challenges that we are faced with is population growth we have faced with is population growth we have faced with is population growth we have a high rural urban migration and then we a high rural urban migration and then we a high rural urban migration and then we also have poverty which has you know also have poverty which has you know also have poverty which has you know permanently permanently permanently manifested itself especially in the manifested itself especially in the manifested itself especially in the rural areas rural areas rural areas yeah and in terms of also our adaptive yeah and in terms of also our adaptive yeah and in terms of also our adaptive capacity we are really faced with you capacity we are really faced with you capacity we are really faced with you know lack of skills and technological know lack of skills and technological know lack of skills and technological transfers within the country but at the transfers within the country but at the transfers within the country but at the same time you know the country has been same time you know the country has been same time you know the country has been doing quite a lot in terms of climate doing quite a lot in terms of climate doing quite a lot in terms of climate change adaptation we have we are change adaptation we have we are change adaptation we have we are currently developing our national currently developing our national currently developing our national adaptation plan adaptation plan adaptation plan and this plan really outlines our long and this plan really outlines our long and this plan really outlines our long to medium-term actions in terms of to medium-term actions in terms of to medium-term actions in terms of adaptation that we as a country are adaptation that we as a country are adaptation that we as a country are planning to take and as well linking it planning to take and as well linking it planning to take and as well linking it to some financing Windows because as we to some financing Windows because as we to some financing Windows because as we know adaptation can be quite costly but know adaptation can be quite costly but know adaptation can be quite costly but at the same time in terms of practical at the same time in terms of practical at the same time in terms of practical measures we all know that Namibia is a measures we all know that Namibia is a measures we all know that Namibia is a party to uh the the Paris agreement and party to uh the the Paris agreement and party to uh the the Paris agreement and we have sort of submitted our intended we have sort of submitted our intended we have sort of submitted our intended nationally determined contributions to nationally determined contributions to nationally determined contributions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as well as to adapt to climate change and well as to adapt to climate change and well as to adapt to climate change and some of the measures that we have some of the measures that we have some of the measures that we have outlined here that we've already started outlined here that we've already started outlined here that we've already started working on really is our early warning working on really is our early warning working on really is our early warning systems for commercial as well as for systems for commercial as well as for systems for commercial as well as for communal Farmers developing rain water communal Farmers

we are especially in flat grown areas we are especially in flat grown areas we are looking into Recycling and reusing looking into Recycling and reusing looking into Recycling and reusing especially gray water promoting climate especially gray water promoting climate especially gray water promoting climate smart agriculture smart agriculture smart agriculture and really also in the infrastructure and really also in the infrastructure and really also in the infrastructure side uh we are looking into building side uh we are looking into building side uh we are looking into building climate resilient infrastructure climate resilient infrastructure climate resilient infrastructure especially in your flat-borne areas uh especially in your flat-borne areas uh especially in your flat-borne areas uh as you've mentioned earlier on uh if as you've mentioned earlier on uh if as you've mentioned earlier on uh if you're faced it with a flood is your you're faced it with a flood is your you're faced it with a flood is your house actually resilient uh to withstand house actually resilient uh to withstand house actually resilient uh to withstand some of these uh the floods so I think some of these uh the floods so I think some of these uh the floods so I think those are some of the measures that those are some of the measures that those are some of the measures that we've been looking into and in terms of we've been looking into and in terms of we've been looking into and in terms of legislation we are also looking at and legislation we are also looking at and legislation we are also looking at and acting a legislation that prohibits you acting a legislation that prohibits you acting a legislation that prohibits you know private people or anyone to really know private people or anyone to really know private people or anyone to really build in a climate sensitive areas build in a climate sensitive areas build in a climate sensitive areas especially along the coastal areas where especially along the coastal areas where especially along the coastal areas where we see an increase in the sea level rise we see an increase in the sea level rise we see an increase in the sea level rise so I think those are some of the so I think those are some of the so I think those are some of the measures that we have as a country being measures that we have as a country being measures that we have as a country being looking into in terms of adaptation so looking into in terms of adaptation so looking into in terms of adaptation so what are the possible mitigation what are the possible mitigation what are the possible mitigation measures in Namibia to reduce climate measures in Namibia to reduce climate measures in Namibia to reduce climate change now that's a very important change now that's a very important change now that's a very important question and I think it's also important question and I think it's also important question and I think it's also important for us to Define what mitigation for us to Define what mitigation for us to Define what mitigation actually means mitigation is really our actually means mitigation is really our actually means mitigation is really our efforts that we take as individuals as efforts that we take as individuals as efforts that we take as individuals as Community as the country take to reduce Community as the country take to reduce Community as the country take to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as I've our greenhouse gas emissions as I've our greenhouse gas emissions as I've mentioned earlier we are party to the to mentioned earlier we are party to the to mentioned earlier we are party to the to the to the Paris agreement we have the to the Paris agreement we have the to the Paris agreement we have submitted our nationally determined submitted our nationally determined submitted our nationally determined contributions and we sort of set a contributions and we sort of set a contributions and we sort of set a target for ourselves to reduce our target for ourselves to reduce our target for ourselves to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by the year greenhouse gas emissions by the year greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030.", "now in terms of some of the 2030.", "now in terms of some of the 2030.", "now in terms of some of the measures that we as a country has been measures that we as a country has been measures that we as a country has been looking into under this main policy looking into under this main policy looking into under this main policy document is to set up concentrated solar document is to set up concentrated solar document is to set up concentrated solar Farms of concentrated solar power plants Farms of concentrated solar power plants Farms of concentrated solar power plants to really to really to really implore us to move from burning fossil implore us to move from burning fossil implore us to move from burning fossil fuels into using renewable energies fuels into using renewable energies fuels into using renewable energies we are also looking at converting our we are also looking at converting our we are also looking at converting our heavy and and light vehicles from uh heavy and and light vehicles from uh heavy and and light vehicles from uh from from burning fossil fuels into from from burning fossil fuels into from from burning fossil fuels into using nitrogen and this is also the using nitrogen and this is also the using nitrogen and this is also the concept of green hydrogen concept of green hydrogen concept of green hydrogen um we are looking at uh plans to come up um we are looking at uh plans to come up um we are looking at uh plans to come up with a mass transportation system within with a mass transportation system within with a mass transportation system within the country to reduce you know the country to reduce you know the country to reduce you know individual car usage exactly and then individual car usage exactly and then individual car usage exactly and then we're also looking at other areas where we're also looking at other areas where we're also looking at other areas where we could have carbon sinks such as the we could have carbon sinks such as the we could have carbon sinks such as the the forestry sector where we are looking the forestry sector where we are looking the forestry sector where we are looking at aforestation as well as reforestation at aforestation as well as reforestation at aforestation as well as reforestation for our younger users I think it's for our younger users I think it's for our younger users I think it's important for us to also distinguish important for us to also distinguish important for us to also distinguish between what reforestation and between what reforestation and between what reforestation and afforestation means a reforestation is afforestation means a reforestation is afforestation means a reforestation is US introducing forests where they used US introducing forests where they used US introducing forests where they used to be forests but the forest had been to be forests but the forest had been to be forests but the forest had been cleared out due to you know people cleared out due to you know people cleared out due to you know people settling in these areas but at the same settling in these areas but at the same settling in these areas but at the same time we're also looking at aforestation time we're also looking at aforestation time we're also looking at aforestation where we are looking at putting up where we are looking at putting up where we are looking at putting up forests at places where there were never forests at places where there were never forests at places where there were never any forests yeah okay so those are some any forests yeah okay so those are some any forests yeah okay so those are some of the areas that you've been looking of the areas that you've been looking of the areas that you've been looking into in terms of the forestry area in into in terms of the forestry area in into in terms of the forestry area in terms of the green hydrogen and energy terms of the green hydrogen and energy terms of the green hydrogen and energy sector but also in terms of waste we sector but also in terms of waste we sector but also in terms of waste we have also committed to at least reduce have also committed to at least reduce have also committed to at least reduce 50 percent of our waste to energy 50 percent of our waste to energy 50 percent of our waste to energy um and and compost especially at our um and and compost especially at our um and and compost especially at our landfills and we are running out of landfills and we are running out of landfills and we are running out of space to actually space to actually space to actually not necessarily a house but like to dump not necessarily a house but like to dump not necessarily a house but like to dump the dub oh yeah the dub oh yeah the dub oh yeah yeah so we're running out of space to yeah so we're running out of space to yeah so we're running out of space to dump our ways so it's really becoming a dump our ways so it's really becoming a dump our ways so it's really becoming a challenge for us waste is a problem for challenge for us waste is a problem for challenge for us waste is a problem for us in the country so those are some of us in the country so those are some of us in the country so those are some of the measures that we've been looking the measures that we've been looking the measures that we've been looking into in terms of mitigation thank you into in terms of mitigation thank you into in terms of mitigation thank you there you've heard it from her but what there you've heard it from her but what there you've heard it from her but what do you think do you think Namibia is do you think do you think Namibia is do you think do you think Namibia is combating progressing and combating combating progressing and combating combating progressing and combating climate change yes indeed I I do think climate change yes indeed I I do think climate change yes indeed I I do think Namibia has progressed very well in Namibia has progressed very well in Namibia has progressed very well in terms of combating climate change and I terms of combating climate change and I terms of combating climate change and I think we've started you know a long time think we've started you know a long time think we've started you know a long time ago for instance in 2001 we have already ago for instance in 2001 we have already ago for instance in 2001 we have already established a National Climate Change established a National Climate Change established a National Climate Change committee wow 2001.", "yes it's been a long committee wow 2001.", "yes it's been a long committee wow 2001.", "yes it's been a long time a long time yeah so we've already time a long time yeah so we've already time a long time yeah so we've already established our climate change committee established our climate change committee established our climate change committee by then this comedy is basically by then this comedy is basically by then this comedy is basically responsible to advise government on responsible to advise government on responsible to advise government on climate change issues in 2011 we have climate change issues in 2011 we have climate change issues in 2011 we have promulgated our national climate change promulgated our national climate change promulgated our national climate change policy in 2013 team we have also policy in 2013 team we have also policy in 2013 team we have also developed our national climate change developed our national

working so hard on doing actually working so hard on doing actually working so hard on doing research they are doing research on the research they are doing research on the research they are doing research on the adaptation measures like as I have said adaptation measures like as I have said adaptation measures like as I have said earlier the patient measures of China or earlier the patient measures of China or earlier the patient measures of China or Philippines cannot be the same as ours Philippines cannot be the same as ours Philippines cannot be the same as ours adaptation measures have actually to be adaptation measures have actually to be adaptation measures have actually to be different from places to another as well different from places to another as well different from

how that you have to be banned out now how that you have to be banned out now how does our the community is now taking how does our the community is now taking how does our the community is now taking how I how is it now affecting them okay let I how is it now affecting them okay let I how is it now affecting them okay let me first explain me first explain me first explain um that handing has been something that um that handing has been something that um that handing has been something that has been done in Namibia for years and has been done in Namibia for years and has been done in Namibia for years and years my grandfather used to hunt your years my grandfather used to hunt your years my grandfather used to hunt your grandfather also used to hunt Okay so grandfather also used to hunt Okay so grandfather also used to hunt Okay so hunting has been something that has hunting has been something that has hunting has been something that has happened in Africa for quite a number of happened in Africa for quite a number of happened in Africa for quite a number of years and during colonialism people years and during colonialism people years and during colonialism people actually exploited it a lot they came to actually exploited it a lot they came to actually exploited it a lot they came to hand more than they were supposed to in hand more than they were supposed to in hand more than they were supposed to in our country and some other countries in our country and some other countries in our country and some other countries in southern Africa southern Africa southern Africa the independence after 1990 we've put up the independence after 1990 we've put up the independence after 1990 we've put up some laws to make sure that handling is some laws to make sure that handling is some laws to make sure that handling is very what we say very well regulated very what we say very well regulated very what we say very well regulated which means that there is laws and which means that there is laws and which means that there is laws and policies so you cannot just go and just policies so you cannot just go and just policies so you cannot just go and just shoot animals in this country you need shoot animals in this country you need shoot animals in this country you need there is a procedure in terms of how you there is a procedure in terms of how you there is a procedure in terms of how you do it and in doing so we have managed do it and in doing so we have managed do it and in doing so we have managed our Wildlife very well and that's why in our Wildlife very well and that's why in our Wildlife very well and that's why in our country we allow that to happen if our country we allow that to happen if our country we allow that to happen if you don't go through those procedures we you don't go through those procedures we you don't go through those procedures we call you you are poaching that is call you you are poaching that is call you you are poaching that is illegal you are not supposed to do that illegal you are not supposed to do that illegal you are not supposed to do that so to be able to hand these procedures so to be able to hand these procedures so to be able to hand these procedures you need to have a payment you need to you need to have a payment you need to you need to have a payment you need to go and hand legally you get money from go and hand legally you get money from go and hand legally you get money from it and in our case with the communities it and in our case with the communities it and in our case with the communities they have to plow it back into those they have to plow it back into those they have to plow it back into those communities so that is what it is so communities so that is what it is so communities so that is what it is so it's not a bad thing if it's just well it's not a bad thing if it's just well it's not a bad thing if it's just well managed and well regulated I think that managed and well regulated I think that managed and well regulated I think that it's it's emotional for other people it's it's emotional for other people it's it's emotional for other people because they have not they have some of because they have not they have some of because they have not they have some of the youth in those countries for the youth in those countries for the youth in those countries for instance were born when they have not instance were born when they have not instance were born when they have not seen these things so for them when they seen these things so for them when they seen these things so for them when they see something being handed they think oh see something being handed they think oh see something being handed they think oh it's going to be finished we want to to it's going to be finished we want to to it's going to be finished we want to to make sure that it's there for make sure that it's there for make sure that it's there for Generations the other thing that I also Generations the other thing that I also Generations the other thing that I also need to mention is that we use it for need to mention is that we use it for need to mention is that we use it for conservation because if these animals conservation because if these animals conservation because if these animals are with communities they are not used are with communities they are not used are with communities they are not used what is going to happen people will just what is going to happen people will just what is going to happen people will just kill them because they don't see any kill them because they don't see any kill them because they don't see any value if if they have to keep them for value if if they have to keep them for value if if they have to keep them for nothing so those are some of the things nothing so those are some of the things nothing so those are some of the things that we need to look at well since we that we need to look at well since we that we need to look at well since we have been have been have been so much about the hunting it's going to so much about the hunting it's going to so much about the hunting it's going to ask very well about it how they put it ask very well about it how they put it ask very well about it how they put it I just would like you to tell us more me I just would like you to tell us more me I just would like you to tell us more me and you about the threats what are the and you about the threats what are the and you about the threats what are the threats when it comes to Community Based threats when it comes to Community Based threats when it comes to Community Based nature Resource Management first of all nature Resource Management first of all nature Resource Management first of all the biggest threat to community-based the biggest threat to community-based the biggest threat to community-based Natural resourcement is the climate Natural resourcement is the climate Natural resourcement is the climate change I'm sure it's a term that most of change I'm sure it's a term that most of change I'm sure it's a term that most of the youth have here this is when you the youth have here this is when you the youth have here this is when you know the areas has become drier there's know the areas has become drier there's know the areas has become drier there's not enough food for Animals whether it's not enough food for Animals whether it's not enough food for Animals whether it's wildlife and whether it's livestock wildlife and whether it's livestock wildlife and whether it's livestock there's not enough that's a big threat there's not enough that's a big threat there's not enough that's a big threat the other threat that we also have is the other threat that we also have is the other threat that we also have is what you were just talking about if what you were just talking about if what you were just talking about if people cannot utilize the resources people cannot utilize the resources people cannot utilize the resources because this laws of people that are because this laws of people that are because this laws of people that are stopping them from using those resources stopping them from using those resources stopping them from using those resources then it is a it's a big threat but it's then it is a it's a big threat but it's then it is a it's a big threat but it's also if communities themselves are not also if communities themselves are not also if communities themselves are not um um um if they don't follow some of the if they don't follow some of the if they don't follow some of the procedures procedures procedures you know if there is regulations and you know if there is regulations and you know if there is regulations and then it's not being followed that also then it's not being followed that also then it's not being followed that also becomes a threat within itself but I becomes a threat within itself but I becomes a threat within itself but I think for us the biggest one is that we think for us the biggest one is that we think for us the biggest one is that we are losing what we call uh areas or are losing what we call uh areas or are losing what we call uh areas or habitat habitat habitat of this Wildlife because if the people of this Wildlife because if the people of this Wildlife because if the people are not keeping those areas open for are not keeping those areas open for are not keeping those areas open for wildlife then it's a threat it's a big wildlife then it's a threat it's a big wildlife then it's a threat it's a big threat for for for the program itself threat for for for the program itself threat for for for the program itself okay very well so well why must we be interested in future why why must we be interested in future why why must we be interested in future why must they you know be part and puzzle of must they you know be part and puzzle of must they you know be part and puzzle of it okay it it is important because it's it okay it it is important because it's it okay it it is important because it's about environment and we all depend on about environment and we all depend on about environment and we all depend on the environment so just imagine if there the environment so just imagine if there the environment so just imagine if there was no trees when the youth now is born was no trees when the youth now is born was no trees when the youth now is born you will be angry with us isn't it you will be angry with us isn't it you will be angry with us isn't it because we have not looked after that because we have not looked after that because we have not looked after that environment and that's why the Youth of environment and that's why the Youth of environment and that's why the Youth of today they have to get up there it's today they have to get up there it's today they have to get up there it's actually it's their right it's their actually it's their right it's their actually it's their right it's their right to say nobody should chop that right to say nobody should chop that right to say nobody should chop that tree because I want my child to look to tree because I want my child to look to tree because I want my child to look to come see what is there nobody should come see what is there nobody should come see what is there nobody should finish this Wildlife because my child finish this Wildlife because my child finish this Wildlife because my child should come and see so it is your right should come and see so it is your right should come and see so it is your right as a as a youth of this country as a as a as a youth of this country as a as a as a youth of this country as a citizen of this country to make sure citizen of this country to make sure citizen of this country to make sure that this environment is look after and that this environment is look after and that this environment is look after and that's why this community-based nature that's why this community-based nature that's why this community-based nature resource program is very very important resource program is very very important resource program is very very important well there you have it by or with Miss well there you have it by or with Miss well there you have it by or with Miss messy right here messy right here messy right here we would

the spoke about earlier on what the spoke about earlier on what the challenges of a community-based natural challenges of a community-based natural challenges of a community-based natural resource management program could be so resource management program could be so resource management program could be so some of the challenges that we have some of the challenges that we have some of the challenges that we have spoken about is that the community spoken about is that the community spoken about is that the community members they get empowered however many members they get empowered however many members they get empowered however many a times they take advantage of the a times they take advantage of the a times they take advantage of the funding that they receive and they use

community-based nature Resource Management we have defined what it is we Management we have defined what it is we Management we have defined what it is we have also spoken that it serves as a have also spoken that it serves as a have also spoken that it serves as a ruler and a conservation development ruler and a conservation development ruler and a conservation development that is helping or giving comprehensive that is helping or giving comprehensive that is helping or giving comprehensive training to local people so that they training to local people so that they training to local people so that they can benefit or derive benefit from can benefit or derive benefit from can benefit or derive benefit from natural resource management yes it works natural resource management yes it works natural resource management yes it works on empowering our local communities as on empowering our local communities as on empowering our local communities as well as to help them monitor the natural well as to help them monitor the natural well as to help them monitor the natural resources that they're using on a daily resources that they're using on a daily resources that they're using

explaining to them what the you know explaining to them what the benefits they can derive from such a benefits they can derive from such a benefits they can derive from such a natural resources and why it's important natural resources and why it's important natural resources and why it's important for them to protect it yes so following for them to protect it yes so following for them to protect it yes so following that today's topic is the challenges and that today's topic is the challenges and that today's topic is the challenges and opportunities of community-based natural opportunities of community-based natural opportunities of community-based natural resources and as we all know natural resources and as we all know natural resources and as we all know natural resources the conflict or the issue is resources the conflict or the issue is resources the conflict or the issue is not just of local concern it is an not just of local concern it is an not just of local concern it is an international a global issue as natural international a global issue as natural international a global issue as natural resources can be shared across borders resources can be shared across borders resources can be shared across borders and this is this actually becomes a and this is this actually becomes a and this is this actually becomes a challenge challenge challenge in countries that are sharing resources in countries that are sharing resources in countries that are sharing resources countries such as Namibia is sharing a countries such as Namibia is sharing a countries such as Namibia is sharing a kalango river with Botswana with Angola kalango river with Botswana with Angola kalango river with Botswana with Angola so now it becomes very difficult when it so now it becomes very difficult when it so now it becomes very difficult when it comes to Community Based nature Resource comes to Community Based nature Resource comes to Community Based nature Resource Management just because of these shared Management just because of these shared Management just because of these shared resources as well our Orange River in resources as well our Orange River in resources as well our Orange River in Oregon as we know or I hope you know Oregon as we know or I hope you know Oregon as we know or I hope you know that there is actually beautiful that there is actually beautiful that there is actually beautiful diamonds in that River but some of those diamonds in that River but some of those diamonds in that River but some of those diamonds get flushed along the river to diamonds get flushed along the river to diamonds get flushed along the river to South Africa so we can't claim that South Africa so we can't claim that South Africa so we can't claim that those are ours when they're also a those are ours when they're also a those are ours when they're also a resource for South Africa yes because we resource for South Africa yes because we resource for South Africa yes because we cannot just protect other nature cannot just protect other nature cannot just protect other nature resources which are the other side of resources which are the other side of resources which are the other side of South Africa but then we have to focus South Africa but then we have to focus South Africa but then we have to focus more on ours and vice Visa as well more on ours and vice Visa as well more on ours and vice Visa as well another challenge of Community Based another challenge of Community Based another challenge of Community Based nature resource management is that many nature resource management is that many nature resource management is that many times yes we have empowered the times yes we have empowered the times yes we have empowered the communities the ruler people and communities the ruler people and communities the ruler people and sometimes they are being entrusted with sometimes they are being entrusted with sometimes they are being entrusted with funds and then many at times they misuse funds and then many at times they misuse funds and then many at times they misuse the fund and the natural resources the fund and the natural resources the fund and the natural resources become depleted so yeah or that they become depleted so yeah or that they become depleted so yeah or that they don't you know you never even see the don't you know you never even see the don't you know you never even see the project developing yeah which is so sad project developing yeah which is so sad project developing yeah which is so sad it is and adding on to what is dimension it is and adding on to what is dimension it is and adding on to what is dimension you know that National politicians sadly you know that National politicians sadly you know that National politicians sadly many times take the credit for the the many times take the credit for the the many times take the credit for the the good work that is being done in the good work that is being done in the good work that is being done in the country but also on the other hand they country but also on the other hand they country but also on the other hand they receive most of the backlash and the receive most of the backlash and the receive most of the backlash and the blame when a management program fails blame when a management program fails blame when a management program fails yeah because if you look at it when you yeah because if you look at it when you yeah because if you look at it when you know we are so quick to judge like yeah know we are so quick to judge like yeah know we are so quick to judge like yeah you don't know the work that goes into you don't know the work that goes into you don't know the work that goes into it before you before he came here it was it before you before he came here it was it before you before he came here it was so successful but another challenge is so successful but another challenge is so successful but another challenge is that the community based nature Resource that the community based nature Resource that the community based nature Resource Management Management Management objectives they are more just about objectives they are more just about objectives they are more just about finances Financial Financial but then finances Financial Financial but then finances Financial Financial but then they need to be extended to people they need to be extended to people they need to be extended to people getting land as well yeah resource getting land as well yeah resource getting land as well yeah resource tensure yes also disappointingly enough tensure yes also disappointingly enough tensure yes also disappointingly enough is that you know the cbnrm institutions is that you know the cbnrm

now affecting them okay let I how is it now affecting them okay let me first explain me first explain me first explain um that handing has been something that um that handing has been something that um that handing has been something that has been done in Namibia for years and has been done in Namibia for years and has been done in Namibia for years and years my grandfather used to hunt your years my grandfather used to hunt your years my grandfather used to hunt your grandfather also used to hunt Okay so grandfather also used to hunt Okay so grandfather also used to hunt Okay so hunting has been something that has hunting has been something that has hunting has been something that has happened in Africa for quite a number of happened in Africa for quite a number of happened in Africa

countries in our country and some other countries in our country and some other countries in southern Africa southern Africa southern Africa the independence after 1990 we've put up the independence after 1990 we've put up the independence after 1990 we've put up some laws to make sure that handling is some laws to make sure that handling is some laws to make sure that handling is very what we say very well regulated very what we say very well regulated very what we say very well regulated which means that there is laws and which means that there is laws and which means that there is laws and policies so you cannot just go and just policies so you cannot just go and just policies so you cannot just go and just shoot animals in this country you need shoot animals in this country you need shoot animals in this country you need there is a procedure in terms of how you there is a procedure in terms of how you there is a procedure in terms of how you do it and in doing so we have managed do it and in doing so we have managed do it and in doing so we have managed our Wildlife very well and that's why in our Wildlife very well and that's why in our Wildlife very well and that's why in our country we allow that to happen if our country we allow that to happen if our country we allow that to happen if you don't go through those procedures we you don't go through those procedures we you don't go through those procedures we call you you are poaching that is call you you are poaching that is call you you are poaching that is illegal you are not supposed to do that illegal you are not supposed to do that illegal you are not supposed to do that so to be able to hand these procedures so to be able to hand these procedures so to be able to hand these procedures you need to have a payment you need to you need to have a payment you need to you need to have a payment you need to go and hand legally you get money from go and hand legally you get money from go and hand legally you get money from it and in our case with the communities it and in our case with the communities it and in our case with the communities they have to plow it back into those they have to plow it back into those they have to plow it back into those communities so that is what it is so communities so that is what it is so communities so that is what it is so it's not a bad thing if it's just well it's not a bad thing if it's just well it's not a bad thing if it's just well managed and well regulated I think that managed and well regulated I think that managed and well regulated I think that it's it's emotional for other people it's it's emotional for other people it's it's emotional for other people because they have not they have some of because they have not they have some of because they have not they have some of the youth in those countries for the youth in those countries for the youth in those countries for instance were born when they have not instance were born when they have not instance were born when they have not seen these things so for them when they seen these things so for them when they seen these things so for them when they see something being handed they think oh see something being handed they think oh see something being handed they think oh it's going to be finished we want to to it's going to be finished we want to to it's going to be finished we want to to make sure that it's there for make sure that it's there for make sure that it's there for Generations the other thing that I also Generations the other thing that I also Generations the other thing that I also need to mention is that we use it for need to mention is that we use it for need to mention is that we use it for conservation because if these animals conservation because if these animals conservation because if these animals are with communities they are not used are with communities they are not used are with communities they are not used what is going to happen people will just what is going to happen people will just what is going to happen people will just kill them because they don't see any kill them because they don't see any kill them because they don't see any value if if they have to keep them for value if if they have to keep them for value if if they have to keep them for nothing so those are some of the things nothing so those are some of the things nothing so those are some of the things that we need to look at well since we that we need to look at well since we that we need to look at well since we have been have been have been so much about the hunting it's going to so much about the hunting it's going to so much about the hunting it's going to ask very well about it how they put it ask very well about it how they put it ask very well about it how they put it I just would like you to tell us more me I just would like you to tell us more me I just would like you to tell us more me and you about the threats what are the and you about the threats what are the and you about the threats what are the threats when it comes to Community Based threats when it comes to Community Based threats when it comes to Community Based nature Resource Management first of all nature Resource Management first of all nature Resource Management first of all the biggest threat to community-based the biggest threat to community-based the biggest threat to community-based Natural resourcement is the climate Natural resourcement is the climate Natural resourcement is the climate change I'm sure it's a term that most of change I'm sure it's a term that most of change I'm sure it's a term that most of the youth have here this is when you the youth have here this is when you the youth have here this is when you know the areas has become drier there's know the areas has become drier there's know the areas has become drier there's not enough food for Animals whether it's not enough food for Animals whether it's not enough food for Animals whether it's wildlife and whether it's livestock wildlife and whether it's livestock wildlife and whether it's livestock there's not enough that's a big threat there's not enough that's a big threat there's not enough that's a big threat the other threat that we also have is the other threat that we also have is the other threat that we also have is what you were just talking about if what you were just talking about if what you were just talking about if people cannot utilize the resources people cannot utilize the resources people cannot utilize the resources because this laws of people that are because this laws of people that are because this laws of people that are stopping them from using those resources stopping them from using those resources stopping them from using those resources then it is a it's a big threat but it's then it is a it's a big threat but it's then it is a it's a big threat but it's also if communities themselves are not also if communities themselves are not also if communities themselves are not um um um if they don't follow some of the if they don't follow some of the if they don't follow some of the procedures procedures procedures you know if there is regulations and you know if there is regulations and you know if there is regulations and then it's not being followed that also then it's not being followed that also then it's not being followed that also becomes a threat within itself but I becomes a threat within itself but I becomes a threat within itself but I think for us the biggest one is that we think for us the biggest one is that we think for us the biggest one is that we are losing what we call uh areas or are losing what we call uh areas or are losing what we call uh areas or habitat habitat habitat of this Wildlife because if the people of this Wildlife because if the people of this Wildlife because if the people are not keeping those areas open for are not keeping those areas open for are not keeping those areas open for wildlife then it's a threat it's a big wildlife then it's a threat it's a big wildlife then it's a threat it's a big threat for for for the program itself threat for for for the program itself threat for for for the program itself okay very well so well why must we be interested in future why why must we be interested in future why why must we be interested in future why must they you know be part and puzzle of must they you know be part and puzzle of must they you know be part and puzzle of it okay it it is important because it's it okay it it is important because it's it okay it it is important because it's about environment and we all depend on about environment and we all depend on about environment and we all depend on the environment so just imagine if there the environment so just imagine if there the environment so just imagine if there was no trees when the youth now is born was no trees when the youth now is born was no trees when the youth now is born you will be angry with us isn't it you will be angry with us isn't it you will be angry with us isn't it because we have not looked after that because we have not looked after that because we have not looked after that environment and that's why the Youth of environment and that's why the Youth of environment and that's why the Youth of today they have to get up there it's today they have to get up there it's today they have to get up there it's actually it's their right it's their actually it's their right it's their actually it's their right it's their right to say nobody should chop that right to say nobody should chop that right to say nobody should chop that tree because I want my child to look to tree because I want my child to look to tree because I want my child to look to come see what is there nobody should come see what is there nobody should come see what is there nobody should finish this Wildlife because my child finish this Wildlife because my child finish this Wildlife because my child should come and see so it is your right should come and see so it is your right should come and see so it is your right as a as a youth of this country as a as a as a youth of this country as a as a as a youth of this country as a citizen of this country to make sure citizen of this country to make sure citizen of this country to make sure that this environment is look after and that this environment is look after and that this environment is look after and that's why this community-based nature that's why this community-based nature that's why this community-based nature resource program is very very important resource program is very very important resource program is very very important well there you have it by or with

anyways so recapping on what we yeah but anyways so recapping on what we yeah but anyways so recapping on what we spoke about earlier on what the spoke about earlier on what the spoke about earlier on what the challenges of a community-based natural challenges of a community-based natural challenges of a community-based natural resource management program could be so resource management program could be so resource management program could be so some of the challenges that we have some of the challenges that we have some of the challenges that we have spoken about is that the community spoken about is that the community spoken about is that the community members they get empowered however many members they get empowered however many members they get empowered however many a times
