According to a statement released by Premier  Frederick Ogwal Oyee, the cultural leader passed away at Lira University Teaching Hospital,  where he had been hospitalized for some time. The sad news has sent waves of shock and grief across  the Lango sub-region and Northern Uganda at large, marking the end of a long reign that defined  the identity and unity of the Lango people. HRH Odur Ebii was widely respected for his  wisdom, calm leadership, and commitment to cultural preservation. His reign, however,  was not without controversy. In recent years, the Lango Cultural Institution was torn by  rivalry between two parallel chiefs—Odur Ebii and Eng. Michael Odongo Okune—each claiming  legitimacy as Won Nyaci (Paramount Chief). The Rivalry That Split the Throne The tension between the two leaders has been a matter of public debate for years. While  Odur Ebii maintained his traditional seat under the original Lango Cultural Foundation, Eng.  Michael Odongo Okune rose through a parallel cultural faction that argued for generational  renewal and reform within the institution. This long-standing division had  often threatened the cultural unity of the Lango people. While Odur Ebii’s  supporters emphasized seniority, continuity, and respect for the founding structure of the  Lango Cultural Foundation, Okune’s faction represented a younger, reformist camp pushing for  modernization and reorganization of leadership. The Otuke Rituals: Coincidence  or Cultural Judgment? Just weeks before Odur Ebii’s passing, Eng.  Michael Odongo Okune was seen performing what witnesses described as “deeply symbolic and  powerful” Lango traditional rituals on the hills of Otuke District. These ceremonies,  which involved spiritual invocations and ancestral offerings, were interpreted by many  as an act of cultural affirmation—a spiritual test of legitimacy before the ancestors. Observers say the rituals were so intense and sacred that some elders privately suggested  they could determine the rightful holder of the Lango throne. With Odur Ebii’s  sudden death following soon after, the timing has stirred both spiritual and  political discussions across Northern Uganda. Could this be coincidence, or was it  the final judgment of the ancestors? Was this the long-awaited sign that would  determine who truly sits as the Won Nyaci? Wikipedia Update and Growing Recognition Interestingly, Wikipedia has already updated its entry to identify Eng. Michael Moses Odongo  Okune as the “Paramount Chief Won Nyaci of Lango.” The entry describes him as a Ugandan cultural  leader for the Lango people in Northern Uganda, born on 6 March 1965, and formerly serving as the  Executive Director of the Uganda Road Fund (URF). Okune’s background as a technocrat and  his role as the Cultural Foreign Affairs Minister (Awitim) and Chairman of the 2012  Lango Conference further enhance his profile as a leader balancing modern  governance with traditional heritage. What Happens Next? The death of HRH Yosam Odur Ebii will likely trigger an official  mourning period and formal cultural rituals. It may also provide an opportunity for  reconciliation within the Lango cultural structure—an end to years of dual leadership. However, some analysts warn that if not handled carefully, this transition could deepen  divisions, especially if elders and clans fail to agree on the next steps. Others see this  as the moment when the ancestors themselves have spoken—clearing the path for unity and a  single cultural identity under one chief. As the Lango people and Uganda at large mourn the  passing of a historic leader, questions remain: Does this mark the end of Lango’s leadership  rivalry? Were Okune’s rituals the decisive spiritual sign—or just a coincidence of fate? Your thoughts matter. Let us know in the comments section.
