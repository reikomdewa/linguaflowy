raised Steve Comella's line I was when I raised Steve Comella's line I was when I raised Steve Comella's line I was Raising it in this context and I Raising it in this context and I Raising it in this context and I apologize for moving from language um we apologize for moving from language um we apologize for moving from language um we speak about unemployment we sing speak about unemployment we sing speak about unemployment we sing unemployment every year every election unemployment every year every election unemployment every year every election campaign and then I've seen some of the campaign and then I've seen some of the campaign and then I've seen some of the data of income and I've wondered if it's data of income and I've wondered if it's data of income and I've wondered if it's intentional or accidental that we speak intentional or accidental that we speak intentional or accidental that we speak unemployment rate and we are so obsessed unemployment rate and we are so obsessed unemployment rate and we are so obsessed versus income rate because that changes versus income rate because that changes versus income rate because that changes your entire view number your

could tell people now if you Africa I could tell people now if you want jobs I'll give you jobs but I'll want jobs I'll give you jobs but I'll want jobs I'll give you jobs but I'll pay you 100 Rand per month I you want pay you 100 Rand per month I you want pay you 100 Rand per month I you want unemployment to end you're unemployed unemployment to end you're unemployed unemployment to end you're unemployed yeah there's 100 Rand no but it's not yeah there's 100 Rand no but it's not yeah there's 100 Rand no but it's not enough you said you want unemployment enough you said you want unemployment enough you said you want unemployment you said you want the land yes's land you said you want the land yes's land you said you want the land yes's land here has 100 Grand versus income where here has 100 Grand versus income where here has 100 Grand versus income where even if people are employed you look at even if people are employed you look at even if people are employed you look at the income even if people are the income even if people are the income even if people are unemployed you still look at the income unemployed you still look at the income unemployed you still look at the income and the con and the conversation should and the con and the conversation should and the con and the conversation should be let's rather focus and look we're be let's rather focus and look we're be let's rather focus and look we're also still focusing on money versus also still focusing on money versus also still focusing on money versus something else cuz money is meant to be something else cuz money is meant to be something else cuz money is meant to be at means to an end but if we were to at means to an end but if we were to at means to an end but if we were to move from from the thought of move from from the thought of move from from the thought of unemployment rates to income rates we unemployment rates to income rates we unemployment rates to income rates we might have a a richer conversation and might have a a richer conversation and might have a a richer conversation and that becomes again stats bikini that that becomes again stats bikini that that becomes again stats bikini that okay we see the unemployment rates but okay we see the unemployment rates but okay we see the unemployment rates but there's something here we're not there's something here we're not there's something here we're not discussing because even the unemployed discussing because even the unemployed discussing because even the unemployed or even the employed rather are still or even the employed rather are still or even the employed rather are still complaining how can it be you have a job complaining how can it be you have a job complaining how can it be you have a job and how do we resolve that well and how do we resolve that well and how do we resolve that well livelihoods I would argue that we have livelihoods I would argue that we have livelihoods I would argue that we have to really talk about to really talk about to really talk about livelihoods um which look at the livelihoods um which look at the livelihoods um which look at the totality and this is where I am inspired totality and this is where I am inspired totality and this is where I am inspired by the multidimensional poverty by the multidimensional poverty by the multidimensional poverty indices and as part of Oxford poverty indices and as part of Oxford poverty indices and as part of Oxford poverty and human development initiative we've and human development initiative we've and human development initiative we've been working on the multi-dimensional been working on the multi-dimensional been working on the multi-dimensional poverty poverty poverty indices uh for the longest that has indices

into the picture you bring income into the picture you bring income into the picture you bring income into the picture you bring living conditions in picture you bring living conditions in picture you bring living conditions in the picture and then you talk about how the picture and then you talk about how the picture and then you talk about how do we resolve this do we resolve this do we resolve this now I've been advocating and I wish to now I've been advocating and I wish to now I've been advocating and I wish to insist if the Minister of Finance his insist if the Minister of Finance his
