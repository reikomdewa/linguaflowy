So then when I speaking other languages. So then when I moved to the Eastern Cape, I literally moved to the Eastern Cape, I literally moved to the Eastern Cape, I literally had to learn it. And I feel like there had to learn it. And I feel like there had to learn it. And I feel like there just wasn't enough database for me to go just wasn't enough database for me to go just wasn't enough database for me to go really as deep as I wanted to. But yeah, really as deep as I wanted to. But yeah, really as deep as I wanted to. But yeah, so my cost was pretty I wouldn't say so my cost was pretty I wouldn't say so my cost was pretty I wouldn't say it's like the best. But but you you're it's like the best. But but you you're it's like the best. But but you you're good. You even Well, you didn't know. good. You even Well, you didn't know. good. You even Well, you didn't know. They had to remind you, but seven me I They had to remind you, but seven me I They had to remind you, but seven me I don't know the numbers in any of the don't know the numbers in any of the don't know the numbers in any of the other South African cuz we didn't learn other South African cuz we didn't learn other South African cuz we didn't learn it. We just acquired I know the months it. We just acquired I know the months it. We just acquired I know the months in Africans and the days because I've in Africans and the days because I've in Africans and the days because I've actually learned it because especially actually learned it because especially actually learned it because especially in Pritoria we just say yeah Tuesday in Pritoria we just say yeah Tuesday in Pritoria we just say yeah Tuesday &gt;&gt; that's the thing with South Africans we &gt;&gt; that's the thing with South Africans we &gt;&gt; that's the thing with South Africans we mix a lot like I said earlier that we mix a lot like I said earlier that we mix a lot like I said earlier that we speak four languages in one sentence speak four languages in one sentence speak four languages in one sentence like it's so diluted like it's so diluted like it's so diluted &gt;&gt; and also I've never met a black person &gt;&gt; and also I've never met a black person &gt;&gt; and also I've never met a black person who speaks English that actually went to who speaks English that actually went to who speaks English that actually went to school to study English. So like even school to study English. So like even school to study English. So like even like the common man on the street in like the common man on the street in like the common man on the street in South Africa does speak some basic South Africa does speak some basic South Africa does speak some basic English. So it's just languages that you English. So it's just languages that you English. So it's just languages that you pick up as you go around you know pick up as you go around you know pick up as you go around you know &gt;&gt; but the thing I it's my favorite thing &gt;&gt; but the thing I it's my favorite thing &gt;&gt; but the thing I it's my favorite thing to count in in in Kosa. to count in in in Kosa. to count in in in Kosa. &gt;&gt; I have an explanation you know when I &gt;&gt; I have an explanation you know when I &gt;&gt; I have an explanation you know when I went to school cuz our school had the went to school cuz our school had the went to school cuz our school had the you had to choose a second language. So you had to choose a second language. So you had to choose a second language. So the first language was English. You had the first language was English. You had the first language was English. You had the option to choose between kosa and the option to choose between kosa and the option to choose between kosa and Africans. I obviously went for Africans Africans. I obviously went for Africans Africans. I obviously went for Africans because I personally felt like kosa was because I personally felt like kosa was because I personally felt like kosa was very difficult and I was trying to I'm very difficult and I was trying to I'm very difficult and I was trying to I'm not going to lie. I was trying to get not going to lie. I was trying to get not going to lie. I was trying to get through school and get it done. So for through school and get it done. So for through school and get it done. So for me, African just became an option where me, African just became an option where me, African just became an option where I just wanted I was like, well, it's I just wanted I was like, well, it's I just wanted I was like, well, it's something different. I already speak something different. I already speak something different. I already speak kosa. K closa is very difficult. So I kosa. K closa is very difficult. So I kosa. K closa is very difficult. So I just went through it. So I think maybe just went through it. So I think maybe just went through it. So I think maybe learning the counting and everything learning the counting and everything learning the counting and everything that could have happened in school, but that could have happened in school, but that could have happened in school, but for me that you would have missed for me that you would have missed for me that you would have missed &gt;&gt; right. And like you said, it's something &gt;&gt; right. And like you said, it's something &gt;&gt; right. And like you said, it's something that you pick up naturally. And my that you pick up naturally. And my that you pick up naturally. And my family, my mom doesn't say, my mom says family, my mom doesn't say, my mom says family, my mom doesn't say, my mom says seven. seven. seven. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. Okay, here's the thing &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. Okay, here's the thing &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. Okay, here's the thing about kosa. We have months in but we about kosa. We have months in but we about kosa. We have months in but we always write them in English like cuz um always write them in English like cuz um always write them in English like cuz um there's like there's like there's like but we all go like January, February, but we all go like January, February, but we all go like January, February, March because the months I think I'm not March because the months I think I'm not March because the months I think I'm not 100% sure about this but um they were 100% sure about this but um they were 100% sure about this but um they were named according to seasons and the kind named according to seasons and the kind named according to seasons and the kind of crops that they bring and all of of crops that they bring and all of of crops that they bring and all of that. that. that. &gt;&gt; That's really interesting. &gt;&gt; That's really interesting. &gt;&gt; That's really interesting. &gt;&gt; I could be wrong. &gt;&gt; I could be wrong. &gt;&gt; I could be wrong. &gt;&gt; They'll tell you in the comments. &gt;&gt; They'll tell you in the comments. &gt;&gt; They'll tell you in the comments. &gt;&gt; Let's check this. &gt;&gt; Let's check this. &gt;&gt; Let's check this. &gt;&gt; Made a big mistake.
