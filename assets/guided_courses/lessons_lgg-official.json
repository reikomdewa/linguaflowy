For instance, oi can mean air or wind or For instance, oi can mean air or wind or For instance, oi can mean air or wind or it can mean to whistle if you say it can mean to whistle if you say it can mean to whistle if you say v. It can mean to cut. If you say oi, we v. It can mean to cut. If you say oi, we v. It can mean to cut. If you say oi, we say it's a tonal language. So if you say say it's a tonal language. So if you say say it's a tonal language. So if you say instead of oi, you say oi, then it means instead of oi, you say oi, then it means instead of oi, you say oi, then it means something totally different. To crown up something totally different. To crown up something totally different. To crown up our session for today, I'll just teach our session for today, I'll just teach our session for today, I'll just teach us a few of the numbers. us a few of the numbers. us a few of the numbers. And we'll start And we'll start And we'll start one aloo one aloo one aloo two two two three na four s three na four s three na four s five toi five toi five toi or some people say to six a or some people say to six a or some people say to six a seven ai seven ai seven ai 8 aro 8 aro 8 aro nine ori nine ori nine ori 10 11 What does What does What does mean? It means 10 on top of it. One D is mean? It means 10 on top of it. One D is mean? It means 10 on top of it. One D is head. So on top of it or on the head of head. So on top of it or on the head of head. So on top of it or on the head of it, you add one on top of the 10. So it, you add one on top of the 10. So it, you add one on top of the 10. So 12 12 12 13 and so forth all the way up to 20 which is all the way up to 20 which is all the way up to 20 which is or the word that we use khali also means or the word that we use khali also means or the word that we use khali also means a stick. So khali is sort of like saying a stick. So khali is sort of like saying a stick. So khali is sort of like saying two sticks. two sticks. two sticks.

And then you'd start again. 21 And then you'd start again. 21 And then you'd start again. 21 22 22 22 23 23 23 and you go on and on until you get to and you go on and on until you get to and you go on and on until you get to because you remember you said one is because you remember you said one is because you remember you said one is aloo, two is, aloo, two is, aloo, two is, three is na. So if you're coming to 30, three is na. So if you're coming to 30, three is na. So if you're coming to 30, 30 becomes na 30 becomes na 30 becomes na and then kali su kali toi khali aa and then kali su kali toi khali aa and then kali su kali toi khali aa and those are the 40s 50s and 60s all and those are the 40s 50s and 60s all and those are the 40s 50s and 60s all the way to 90 and 100 becomes turu aloo. the way to 90 and 100 becomes turu aloo. the way to 90 and 100 becomes turu aloo. The word for 100 is turu. I do not know The word for 100 is turu. I do not know The word for 100 is turu. I do not know the meaning or origin of that one but the meaning or origin of that one but the meaning or origin of that one but that is it tou and then you start again that is it tou and then you start again that is it tou and then you start again turui 200 tou turui 200 tou turui 200 tou and so forth turi and so forth turi and so forth turi all the way to a thousand now I think all the way to a thousand now I think all the way to a thousand now I think the word a thous for a thousand the word a thous for a thousand the word a thous for a thousand which is the word alifu alu which is the word alifu alu which is the word alifu alu alifu I think was borrowed from the alifu I think was borrowed from the alifu I think was borrowed from the swahili word alfu in swahili 1,00 is swahili word alfu in swahili 1,00 is swahili word alfu in swahili 1,00 is aluma. aluma. aluma. So in Nubra it's alu meaning the word So in Nubra it's alu meaning the word So in Nubra it's alu meaning the word for thousand was actually borrowed from for thousand was actually borrowed from for thousand was actually borrowed from the swahili alu alu alui all the way and the swahili alu alu alui all the way and the swahili alu alu alui all the way and then the word for million was borrowed then the word for million was borrowed then the word for million was borrowed from English. So look for million we'll from English. So look for million we'll from English. So look for million we'll say million alu say million alu say million alu million million million million million million million million million and all the way. and all the way. and all the way. So we'll stop here for today. I hope So we'll stop here for today. I hope So we'll stop here for today.
