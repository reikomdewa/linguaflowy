the i now unless they have to say i in the i is dialect dialect dialect imi or ambi imi or ambi imi or ambi now you now you now you the subject form is o the subject form is o the subject form is o but the object form is mu so omar you are coming this is the o is so omar you are coming this is the o is so omar you are coming this is the o is subject oman you are candy but ending there is object ending there is object ending there is object okay so we have a subject and then move okay so we have a subject and then move okay so we have a subject and then move as objects so when our contents are as objects so when our contents are as objects so when our contents are centered whenever whenever centered whenever whenever centered whenever whenever the you is doing the action we use oh the you is doing the action we use oh the you is doing the action we use oh but one day you is going to receive the but one day you is going to receive the but one day you is going to receive the action so that we see that we use more action so that we see that we use more action so that we see that we use more we don't define to that but this is just we don't define to that but this is just we don't define to that but this is just the the the intro but these are this technology intro but these are this technology intro but these are this technology business one there's danger basis too business one there's danger basis too business one there's danger basis too already this is three so you just be already this is three so you just be already this is three so you just be climbing and then you're good to go so now let's not have to say take in so now let's not have to say take in so now let's not have to say take in that now take this but then i just shall walk okay okay okay so so so maybe maybe maybe take that in take that in take that in more mono more mono more mono more one or one more one or one more one or one take a thing take a thing take a thing take a thin one or more sometimes take sometimes take sometimes take take is sometimes you use collect also take is sometimes you use collect also take is sometimes you use collect also this you don't just say but when you are taking the but when you are taking the but when you are taking the the object from the ground they see that the object from the ground they see that the object from the ground they see that online
