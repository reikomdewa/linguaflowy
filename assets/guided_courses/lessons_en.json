Yippee! How lucky for me!” he thinks. He grabs the bone, and happily runs home. He runs past the train station and the school. He runs through the park. He runs onto a bridge. On the bridge, the dog looks down into the deep, still water below. There, he sees another dog with a bone in its mouth. “Who is that dog?” he wonders. \"What is he doing down there?\" The dog stares at the other dog. The other dog stares back. “Where did that dog get such a BIG bone?” the dog wonders. \"Why is his bone bigger than mine?\" The dog growls at the other dog. The other dog growls too. “I want that big bone!” he thinks. The greedy dog decides to steal the other dog's bone. He leaps off the bridge and into the water. Splash! But as soon as he hits the water, the other dog disappears. There was never any other dog. It was just his own reflection! The water is very deep and the dog is surprised. “Woof woof woof! Help!” he barks. And when he barks, his bone drops from his mouth — and sinks to the bottom of the water. The dog swims to shore. He is wet and cold, and now he has no bone at all.

In absolute  darkness, crushed by the weight of mountains, starved of oxygen, cooked alive, bathed  in acid, salt or radiation. And yet, they live for thousands, perhaps  millions of years! It turns out, this planet is not in space –––  it is inside the crust of Earth! This is the deep biosphere and  we basically learned that it exists yesterday. Its volume is at least  twice as large as all the Earth’s oceans, home to more microbes than the rest of  the entire planet.Their total biomass is more than 20 times greater than all  humans, livestock, and animal wildlife. Let’s descend into this mad, deadly world where none of the rules we  thought are mandatory for life apply. Going Deeper and Deeper Deep life seems to be everywhere we  look: below the oceans, near volcanoes, beneath the glaciers of Antarctica, under any  landscape we can imagine and anywhere we live. We’ll use a special duck science drill and  start our journey in familiar territory: on land, in the soil, where plants grow  and animals roam. If earth were an onion, this is the very top of the very top layer.  Soil is a lavish four-way partnership of air, water, minerals and organic matter, bathed  in endless energy. Life lives in luxury here. Plants exploit this paradise and produce more  than 30 times the biomass of all of Earth’s animals each year, in a constant cycle of growth  and decay. Only a tiny fraction of the biomass is buried deeper in the ground, supplying juicy  resources for almost half a billion years. As we dig deeper, most of the  air has been squeezed out and we cross the water table into a  zone saturated with groundwater, rich in minerals and some organic matter. Roots  from the most ambitious plants reach down here, and the most common inhabitants are  scavengers living off decay. This layer can be pretty cold because it is still  slowly warming up from the most recent ice age. Klunk We reach bedrock. A foundation of solid rock for  all the less solid stuff above, home to fractures filled with water . It can be exposed to the  surface, or buried hundreds of meters below stuff. Here, in the dense bedrock, we’re in a weird  planet inside the planet. The most thrilling zone of the deep biosphere. As we drill further  down, temperatures gradually begin to rise, and soon it gets really hot and the pressure  rises. Underneath 400 meters of rock, the pressure is similar to the surface of  Venus. We drill faster now, down to 1000 meters, deeper than the Burj Khalifa is tall. It is about  30°C , and there is almost no free oxygen left. We continue and finally stop almost  4 kilometers down. Above us pressing solid rock weighing tens of thousands of  tons with pressures as intense as at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Down here it is on  average 120 degrees C , even hotter if a magma plume is nearby. The heat is a leftover from  Earth's formation and from from the decay of radioactive elements like thorium and uranium  that shower the crust with a constant wave of radioactivity. To make things worse some rocks  are mixed with extreme amounts of salt. Hell. And yet. Life is thriving. Inside rock! If we zoom  in, we see that solid rock is not actually solid! It’s traversed by cracks, voids and tiny pores.  Sandstone, limestone or basalt are so porous that up to 40 percent of their volume is actually empty  space. But even much denser rocks like granite, can be split open by cracks and fractures.  We’ve found a gigantic planet spanning system of micro-caves, free real estate  filled with water and hardcore microbes! And these caves are moving. Just like the atmosphere is constantly mixing  air to create weather, down here rocks are mixing to create rock weather. Submerged  mountain ranges are shifting and ripping, crashing and merging. Continents  smash into each other with the energy of millions of nuclear weapons  but as slow as your fingernails grow. Countless tiny and not so tiny earthquakes  rip open tiny new fissures and passageways, creating new spaces for life and closing others  off forever. In this hot, moving pressure cooker, minerals are forged and baked, and  organic molecules are created and destroyed. An insane menu for anyone  brave enough to try to survive down here. Let us venture into the system  of tiny caves and meet some of them. The Most Extreme Living Things We think that octillions  of microbes live down here, and naturally they are pretty hardcore.  The doomsday preppers of the underworld. Some have big, bulky genomes, living entirely on  their own, basically forming their own ecosystem. Like the bacterium Desulforudis audaxviator.  It synthesises its own food by nibbling carbon or sulfur from the rock and turning it into  organic substances. If the conditions get too extreme or if there is no food around,  it kills itself to survive, by forming an endospore. It divides into a big and a small part,  and swallows the small part again, forming a cell, within a cell. The outer cell then sheds its  water and kills itself, leaving the spore to float around, maybe for thousands of years until  it finds a good place to spring to life again. Others like some company, like the archaea  with the clunky name Altiarchaeum hamiconexum, that have a rare double membrane covered in  weird materials that protect them against the extremes. They shoot out nano-sized  grappling hooks to tether themselves and seem to live in cracks and fissures filled  with water completely devoid of oxygen, harvest carbon dioxide to create  biomass, and may sort of eat hydrogen. The conditions in the deep biosphere are so  harsh that other microbes share the hard work by forming consortia. They knit themselves  together in a biofilm – a very thin, sticky net that shields them against the extremes. They  are miniature cells, often with a small genome, but each good at one thing. One type of microbe  eats methane and excretes its electrons. A second type eats these electrons and converts sulphate  into sulfite that is then eaten by a third microbe and so on. Some eat iron, others use electrons  to turn nitrogen or carbon dioxide into biomass. Life down here found ways to use stuff that  is poisonous to most animals to make food and energy. But still, life is incredibly hard and  resources and energy are super hard to come by. So the most intense strategy for survival  down here is to live forever. Like monks who’ve taken a vow of poverty, deep microbes  consume very little and conserve their energy. Their metabolism is up to a million times  slower than microbes at the surface. They had a meal when you were born and are still  digesting it. For most of their life they exist in a slow limbo – some even slowly cannibalise  themselves. Until a sudden influx of resources arrives by pure chance – and then they spring  into action and reproduce. With this lifestyle it seems that extreme microbes can live for  centuries, maybe even for millions of years! If they are not hunted to death, of course.  Because kilometers deep in limestone habitats, there seem to be spaces big enough for  multicellular predators. We found asexual worms, 100 times longer than microbes, hunting  and devouring bacteria. It's not clear if they originated down here or if  mini earthquakes opened up fractures for water to carry them into the deep.  But there are other fierce predators like rotifers or arthropods in the  depths, hunting immortal microbes. We wish we could tell you more insane things  about life in the deep biosphere but there is a problem. We don’t know that much yet. For one,  we can not really get a good look under kilometers of rock. Drilling down could contaminate  the samples with microbes from the surface. We found living ones in deep mines  and brought them into the lab. But it is pretty hard to simulate the conditions  they feel comfy in – in boiling hot water, squeezed under mountains, submerged in  deadly chemicals – and still see them through a microscope. And the microbes live so  slowly, for so long that nothing might happen. A lot of what we know about them we  got from turning them into a slurry and looking at what their genes could do.  Like “breathing” nitrogen or eating methane. We know that the diversity of life in the deep  biosphere must be staggering and that some of the most hardcore and extreme beings live down  there. This is a proper frontier of science, super hard to study and most of  what we know we learned in just the last 20 years. There is so much  more undiscovered mystery for us, that could bring us progress in  medicine, energy, the climate, and more. Let’s end by moving our gaze from the inside  to the outside again. Since we now know how extremely large the deep biosphere is and how  life down there survives without light, oxygen, sane temperatures or not being covered  in poison… could there be deep biospheres all over the universe? Maybe all you need is a  planet or moon with internal heat or radiation. And a chemical composition that allows  microbes to build the parts they need. Some scientists suggest that there could  be ten of them in the solar system, hiding beneath a seemingly dead and  frozen surface. So as we learn more and more about the life below our feet, we may  accidentally learn about life in the universe. You're lucky. YOU dont need to drill dozens  of kilometers through solid rock to discover something mindblowing. You can just order  some inspiration right to your doorstep.

Our best theory of the universe  could be wrong – finally. We’re going through an incredibly exciting moment. Thanks to amazing new technology, our understanding of the universe is  moving faster than it has in years. And if we are fortunate, we could be at the  edge of the next revolution in the way we see the cosmos – a moment as exciting as when we first  realized that the Earth revolves around the Sun, that the stars are other suns, or that our galaxy  is just one tiny island in an ocean of trillions. Why do we think this? Because for the first time in ages,  the universe is misbehaving. Badly. Nasty Universe For decades, we’ve had a  beautiful theory of the cosmos. One that explained how the universe began, what  it’s made of, and how it’s supposed to behave. It matched our observations astonishingly well and made us feel like we’d almost  deciphered the cosmic code. But in the last few years, as our telescopes got better and our  data sharper, cracks started to appear. Strange mismatches between what the  theory predicted and what we actually saw. At first they looked like silly mistakes,  noise that would go away with more data. But as new data came in, the opposite happened. Some cracks got larger, new ones emerged, and our once perfect picture of the cosmos  began to look less and less … perfect. Of course, this wasn’t new. Two centuries ago, astronomers noticed that Uranus’ orbit didn’t quite  follow the laws of gravity. But instead of throwing those laws away, they proposed that a “dark planet”  was tugging on Uranus from afar. Shortly after, Neptune was discovered –  exactly where the math said it would be. But then came Mercury. Its orbit also didn’t make sense,  so scientists tried the same trick. But this time, no new planet showed up. The answer wasn’t more stuff,  but a completely new idea. Gravity had to be reimagined, and we  invented general relativity – opening a whole new dimension in our  understanding of the universe. So are we going through a  Uranus moment or a Mercury one? First Crack – Cosmic Monsters The first signs that something deep  could be off began piling up around 15 years ago – in the form of a few  seemingly impossible cosmic monsters: A “giant arc” of galaxies over  3 billion light-years wide. A massive group of quasars  spanning 4 billion light-years. A ring of galaxies 5 billion light-years across. An unfathomable wall of galaxies  stretching ten billion light-years from end to end – a whopping 10%  of the entire observable universe. The list goes on. That’s not all. There are also monstrous voids: vast cosmic deserts with far  fewer galaxies than normal. And according to some surveys, we  happen to be living deep inside one of them – a gargantuan “local  hole” 2 billion light-years across. Where’s the problem? Well, the universe is organized  in ever larger structures: galaxies, galaxy clusters,  superclusters and eventually filaments – truly gargantuan structures  separated by equally enormous voids. But our cosmic theory says that these  things can’t get arbitrarily large. At distances beyond one billion light-years or so, the filaments and voids should  blur into a uniform soup. And this is more than a technical detail – it’s a basic pillar of all our attempts  to make sense of the cosmos itself. Our understanding of the universe  rests on one key assumption: the cosmological principle. This is the idea that, if you zoom out far enough, the universe should be uniform,  looking the same everywhere. This is crucial because it means that our limited  view of the cosmos is a fair sample of the whole. That, even if we are tiny creatures  living in a speck of dust, we can learn things about the entire universe. Both the cosmos itself and our place in it might  be more unruly and chaotic than they should be. But if the cosmological principle turns  out to be wrong, we have a huge problem. Because if the universe isn’t the same everywhere, we could be like ants trying to guess the flavor  of a cake while sitting on its only cherry. Everything we see might just  be local weirdness – a cosmic quirk that doesn’t tell us the  actual story of the universe. Second Crack – A Universe at Two Speeds The next crack appeared about 10 years ago. It tore straight at the fabric of  space – challenging how fast it grows. Every second the universe gets a little bigger. We know this because we have  different ways to measure it and all confirm that space is expanding. The problem? They can’t agree on how fast. It’s like measuring the speed of a car using  two devices and getting different results. You read 67 on the speedometer, but 73 on the GPS. One of the instruments must be broken, right? But then you check them again and again  and again… and both work flawlessly. This is very much what happens with the universe. The details are messy and complicated,  but they don’t matter for this story. The important part is that, as measurements and  calculations have become more and more precise, the disagreement has only become worse. By now, the chance that this mismatch is just an  accidental fluke is less than one in a million. The universe is literally giving us two  different answers to the same question. So something fundamental must be broken –  either our measurements of the universe, or our basic understanding of it. Third Crack – Old Galaxies in a Baby Universe The latest surprise is only about 3 years old. It shattered a key part of our cosmic timeline  – how and when the first galaxies formed. Telescopes act like time machines. Light from distant galaxies takes so long to reach us that we don’t see them as they are  now, but as they were in the past. In 2021 we launched the James Webb, the  most powerful space telescope ever built. And almost immediately, it began finding bright, massive galaxies so distant that they belong to  a time when the universe was extremely young. The problem? Some are so premature that they date back to 280 million years after the Big Bang –  far earlier than anyone expected. Our theory says that the amorphous soup  of matter that emerged from the Big Bang gave rise to the first galaxies  through a long chain of mergers. Tiny lumps of dark and normal  matter gathered under gravity, building larger chunks that then  fused into even bigger ones and so on. But this process is lengthy. By our best estimates, the  first large galaxies should have emerged 500 million years after  the Big Bang or so, not much before. But it isn’t only that we’ve found  large galaxies existing way before that. The new galaxies also seem to be too mature. Matter in the baby universe was made up  almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. Heavy elements like carbon or nitrogen were  only forged later in the cores of stars, which had to explode to release them. But some of these super early galaxies  contain a lot of heavy elements – meaning that entire generations of stars must  have lived and died even before them. So this is like finding  grown-up kids in a kindergarten. Either the first galaxies  sprouted in fast forwards, or we are missing something huge  about the infancy of the universe. From Cracks to Crisis These problems aren’t the only ones. Our theory also says that the Big Bang  should have created 3 times more lithium than we see out there – a decades-old  itch that astronomers just can’t scratch. It predicts that dark matter should  pile up sharply at galaxy centers, but instead we find gentle hills. It says that dark energy, the mysterious  force pushing the universe apart, has stayed constant since the Big Bang. But last year, one of the  biggest galaxy surveys ever conducted dropped the bombshell that  it may have been changing over time. If true, this would overturn our current picture  of the universe, its past and its future. Even things that we considered  settled beyond any doubt, like the interpretation of the cosmic  microwave background, are suddenly up for debate – those early galaxies might have  been bright enough to contaminate the signal. These are bold claims that  require much more evidence. But the mere fact that such fundamental  pillars are being discussed is staggering. So ok – what does all this mean? Right now there are furious battles going on. Some scientists argue that  these aren’t real cracks, but mirages that will disappear with time, or  raw gems that will end up refining our theories. Others are more radical and say  we need completely new ideas. But whatever the case, the big picture is difficult to ignore – the  sense of crisis is growing. And for the first time in ages, we don’t really know what cosmology  will look like when the dust settles. Which is amazing. Because in science, “crisis” doesn’t mean failure. It means that the machine is healthy and working. Science doesn’t move in a straight line, but in cycles – periods of  calm followed by sudden crises. When a crisis hits, experiments start giving  results that don’t fit existing theories, confusion grows, and strange ideas pop up. And eventually, there is a revolution. A deeper truth emerges, and a  new cycle starts over again. The universe is screaming  that our story is incomplete. Whether we’ll find a cosmic  Neptune or a cosmic Mercury, one thing is certain – the cosmos is  about to get a lot more interesting.

"language": "en", "content": "Is the universe infinite? Does it have an edge?  And if so, what would you see if you went there? Today we know that the universe had a beginning  14 billion years ago and that it's been expanding ever since. But something that's  expanding should also have an edge, right? Well, it sort of does. Information can’t travel faster than light. That  means that we can only see parts of the universe whose light has had time to reach us in the  last 14 billion years. When we look outwards, what we see is a sphere centered on us, the  observable universe. But it gets a tad more complicated – because the universe has been  expanding, we know that the most far away things whose light we can see are actually  45 billion lightyears from us right now. So the observable universe is a sphere  with a radius of 45 billion light years. It contains around 200 billion galaxies,  each with hundreds of billions of stars. So for us, there is an edge: We are looking  at the past until there is just no past left. This edge is really more like an edge  in time and in a sense meaningless. The real universe is for sure bigger  than what we can see. But how much? There are two options – either the universe is  really big but finite, or it’s truly infinite. A finite universe means that, if  you want to fill it with ice cream, you can do it. You need a lot of ice  cream, but it is a finite amount. But that leads to a weird problem. Such a universe  should have an edge, a cosmic wall where space ends. And if there is an edge there should be  something outside that edge. But the universe by definition is “all there is”, so how could there  be stuff outside all there is? Does the idea of something outside of everything even make sense?  Except of course there is a physics hack: You can have a universe that has no border, but that still  could be filled with a finite amount of ice cream. What if the universe is truly finite? Imagine an orange and a really tiny ant.  The ant can only see a small piece of the skin – just as you can only see a small chunk  of the universe. But if the ant starts walking, it will eventually walk around the  whole orange and be back to its starting point. So the skin of an orange is  not infinite – but it doesn’t have a border. The universe is not like the skin of an orange,  but it could be very similar – instead of a sphere, it could be a hypersphere, where 3D-space  is curled on itself. Which is impossible for your brain to visualize unfortunately. But the  point is: no borders, no outside of the hyper sphere – from our human ant perspective, our  whole 3D space is like the peel of the orange. If you were aboard a spaceship flying in a straight  line, you would eventually come back to Earth. How does any of this make sense? The actual  physics is hard, so we have to simplify and lie a bit here. But in a nutshell it all boils  down to gravity: The way it works is that mass creates gravity by bending spacetime. This  bending is the strongest where the mass is, but sort of stretches on forever, like a very  mild tension in the fabric of spacetime itself. This could bend the whole universe in  a way where it bends back on itself, which then makes the hypersphere. If you  find this confusing, we are with you. If the universe happens to be a hypersphere, how  could we find out how big it is? On Earth we can see things disappear below the horizon and  that helps us calculate how big the Earth is. Scientists tried to find some sort of “universe  horizon” that would reveal the scale of the cosmic sphere – but didn’t see anything. Which  means that if the universe is a hypersphere, it needs to be so big that from our perspective  it looks like we are living on a flat surface. For this to make sense, a hyperspherical universe  should be at least 1,000 times bigger than our observable part. It could be a trillion times  bigger for all we know, but not smaller than that. Some scientists thought all of this is way too  straight forward and came up with a wilder option: The universe could be like the frosting of  a donut. A hyperdonut – also impossible to visualize for your brain. This, too, means  that if you travel in a straight line, you'd get back to where you started. But with fun complications. In a hyperdonut universe there is  not the same amount of stuff in every direction. If two spaceships  fly in different directions, one could get back to the start way earlier.  This also means that light from faraway galaxies would do fun and confusing stuff,  in a sort of cosmic hall-of-mirrors effect. We could see far away things in two places  – but not just that, but we would see it in different moments in time! Because its  light would have taken much longer to travel in one direction than the other!  You could see a star being born in front of you and see that same star die  on the opposite side of the sky. How big would such a hyper donut universe  be? Well, because of its strange geometry, actually this is kind of the smallest possible  universe – potentially just a few times bigger than the observable universe. But it could  also be way, way bigger. We don’t know. Ok. So much for finite universes. But… What if it's truly infinite and space goes  on forever? What would that be like? What if the universe is truly infinite? Actually, the cosmological model used by  most scientists, describes an infinite universe. We mostly use it to calculate  what happens inside our observable chunk, but if taken literally, it  predicts an infinite universe. An infinite universe goes on, well,  forever, with no border anywhere – also impossible to visualize. Wherever you  look you'll find more and more stuff in every possible direction. This kind of  breaks our brain a bit for a few reasons: First of all, if the universe is infinite, is  it also eternal and has been there forever? Was there a time where there was nothing  everywhere and then there was something everywhere? Well we don’t know – but we  have a lot of evidence for the big bang, so it really seems like the universe  started at some point in the past. But wait – since the big bang the  universe has been expanding. How can an infinite thing that is everywhere  become even bigger? Cosmic expansion just means that the distance between  galaxies is growing with time. Even an infinite space can become bigger.  Welcome to the paradoxes of infinity. Infinity gets much weirder though. As you  travel with your spaceship in a straight line, you find new galaxies, stars and planets, new  wonders, new weird stuff, probably new aliens and new lifeforms stranger than you could ever  imagine. But after a long time, you might find the most special thing in the universe: Yourself. An  exact copy of you watching this video right now. How can that be? Well, everything in existence is  made of a finite amount of different particles. And a finite number of different particles can  only be combined in a finite number of ways. That number may be so large that it feels like  infinity to our brains – but it's not really. If you have finite options to build  things, but infinite space that is full of things in all directions forever,  then it makes sense that by pure chance, there will likely be repetition. Although  just because something is possible, doesn't mean it will actually happen. Maybe  the universe goes on forever but only the boring stuff repeats itself endlessly.  Maybe there is really only one you. But if the laws of physics are  the same everywhere, then far, far away gas could have given  birth to stars and planets, where primitive genetic information could  emerge from chemistry. Which might have ended up in cells and animals that evolved  in really unlikely ways. And eventually apes that learn how to create online videos. It  happened at least once, so the chance is not 0. Even if the chance of there being an exact  copy of you watching this video right now is almost zero – almost zero is still  a huge number in an infinite universe. Unfortunately you'll never meet. Because almost  zero still means the chance is incredibly small. Earth as it exists right now is so unlikely,  you’d have to travel incredibly far to find a second identical Earth: Some 10 to the 10  to the 29 – a 1 followed by 100 octillion zeros – times the size of the observable universe.  So far that it kind of means forever far away. Still, in a truly infinite universe, every  combination of particles could reasonably not just (sighs) It's time to stop now. While these  scenarios are possible on paper – we've entered science philosophy here. Currently  none of these ideas are testable or proveable. If the universe is infinite we will never know. The reality is, for us the universe is finite  and has an edge. And we can see the edge, the edge in time. Everything we can interact with is within the observable universe and  most likely, this will stay true forever. Even if this finite universe feels small to  you, it's more than big enough to fulfill all the dreams that we and our descendants can ever  come up with. Infinitely enough for all of us. While we can’t be sure whether  the universe is infinite, many fascinating questions do have  definitive answers in science, math, and technology - and you can learn  all about them on Brilliant.org. Brilliant will make you a better thinker and  problem solver, with thousands of hands-on lessons on just about anything you may be curious  about. They recently launched a whole new suite of data courses that use real data to tell powerful  stories while training your brain to see trends through the chaos of truly massive data sets.  You’ll answer practical questions like: how to maximize revenue hosting on airbnb using the  same analysis techniques that scientists use to explore the distribution of galaxies  and unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, a foundation that can take your  understanding to astronomical heights. We’ve also partnered with Brilliant to create  a series of lessons to take your scientific knowledge to the next level.

A new frontier of sci ence, something truly new that  we are only just beginning to understand. Let us dive into the  wild world of the human virome. You are an Ecosystem You're a living, breathing ecosystem made of up  to 40 trillion cells. This metropolis of flesh is home to the human microbiome, another 40 trillion  bacteria that have a contract with your body: They get to live here and in return they  break down your meals. They synthesise vitamins in your gut, neutralise acid in  your mouth, help balance your immune system, and they take up space preventing  harmful bacteria from getting in. This is a fragile balance – bacteria really  only look out for themselves, multiplying and testing their boundaries.  To keep their numbers in check, your body's ecosystem needs  a group of deadly predators: Viruses. At least ten trillion. They're literally everywhere in your body,  tens of thousands of different species. At least a few trillion live in your gut,  where also most of your resident bacteria are. At least 18 billion on your skin,  100 million in each drop of your saliva, dozens of millions in your urinary tract.  Even in a single drop of the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding your nerves and brain,  researchers found up to 10,000 viruses. While this sounds like a horrible idea at first, at least in the gut, around 97% of  them are bacteriophages, or phages, bizarre creatures that are specialised in  hunting down and killing resident bacteria and are not able to infect your cells. Instead  they kill trillions of bacteria every single day. Together these viruses make up the human  virome – a symbiotic virus ecosystem that is completely unique to you and that seems  to be crucial for your health. Let’s get to know them and see how they support you  – and what happens if things go wrong. The Silent Mass Murderers of Your Body Inside your gut, a stealthy Lambda Phage  floats through the buzzing crowds of bacteria, looking for a victim. It has six legs, a long thin  body and a big head, made of geometric shapes, filled with genetic material. Each species is  specialized in hunting one specific species of bacteria and ignores all others.  Lambda is looking for Escherichia coli. This versatile bacteria is numerous in your  gut, usually a good boy synthesising vitamins for you. But it also has a dark side – some of  them would much rather live inside your flesh and feast on your resources. If there are too  many or if they manage to invade your tissue, they can cause serious diseases. So one  of the most important jobs of the virome is to control the numbers of different  bacteria populations. By killing them. Lambda has found a victim. Spider-like legs get  a hold of a bacteria and grip it hard. Like an angry syringe it violently rams its sharp bottom  into the victim’s body and releases its DNA and Once inside, the proteins disable the  defenses of the bacterium. It is now a factory under new management. It  is forced to build new viruses until the victim is filled up and bursts open,  releasing a horde of fresh Lambda viruses. But its goal is not genocide. Phages need a healthy population of bacteria  to survive. So sometimes they choose a way more sinister tactic. Instead of killing their  victim, the virus integrates its DNA into the genome of the bacteria and goes to sleep. When the  bacteria multiplies, the virus DNA is multiplied too. Until one day the viral DNA re-awakens and  suddenly decides to kill its unsuspecting victim. And here things become exciting – your  virome also needs you to thrive. It’s in its best interest that you are healthy. So some  viruses inject genes into bacteria that actively make them support your body. Some force their  bacteria hosts to support your gut’s mucus layer, break down complex carbohydrates  from your food more efficiently, creating substances that  protect against inflammation. And they alter what signals bacteria send to your  immune cells. Basically they’re letting them know: We have things under control, you  can chill out. This may prevent allergic reactions or even protect  you against autoimmune diseases. But of course, there is also a dark side to  this story. Some viruses don’t care about our health. Instead of helping they turn  harmless bacteria into deadly monsters. When Viruses turn Bacteria into killers Some species of bacteriophage carry  dangerous genes for toxic substances. When they take over their hosts, they  can integrate into the genetic code of the bacteria where they lay as a deadly gift. Like the case of the Vibrio cholerae and the CTXφ bacteriophage hunting them. Most  strains of the cholerae bacteria are harmless and billions of them may live in your  gut right now. When CTXφ infect the bacteria, they gift them the genes for the cholera  toxin, which permanently becomes part of their genetic lineage forever. It's  like handing a house cat a shotgun. Vibrio cholerae shower these toxins at the  cells lining your gut, making them sick. They vomit large amounts of salt, which pulls out  a flood of water into your intestines. This causes explosive diarrhoea and vomiting,  draining your body of fluid. If untreated, about half of patients die. But for the  phage and bacteria this is great. They are carried out of the body to infect more humans,  spreading and multiplying further. This strain of Vibrio cholerae is now a dangerous  enemy of humanity thanks to this virus. Or the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which is  hunted by the phage with the amazing name: φSa3ms. Usually the bacteria is mostly harmless  and lives on your skin and inside your nose. It doesn’t do anything useful per  se, its main job is to take up space, making it harder for hostile bacteria to  colonise your body. But φSa3ms can change this quickly – it carries multiple dangerous genes,  like giving a cat flamethrowers and grenades. If such a modified Staphylococcus aureus  bacteria gets into your body through a tiny cut, it becomes extremely dangerous. One of its new  weapons are superantigens, which basically is like injecting your immune cells with cocaine.  The toxin completely breaks your carefully fine tuned immune system. It activates all of your  T cells, all at once and makes them flip out. They release a tsunami of cytokines, activating  all of your defenses at once. The infection is flooded with cells that can’t fight the  bacteria and cause heavy inflammation. Your broken and confused immune cells have a  really hard time fighting Staphylococcus aureus, which now invades, penetrating deep into your  tissue. Your body is trying to seal the wounds and isolate the invader, but another new  weapon it gained has the ability to just dissolve the barriers and penetrate even deeper.  Before the onset of antibiotics an infection with Staphylococcus aureus was very deadly and we  have φSa3ms to thank for making it even deadlier. But the viruses of our virome may also  directly save your life – by killing cancer. Cancer Killing Viruses Oncolytic viruses specialize in hunting and  killing cancer – like the Newcastle Disease virus or the Reovirus, who mostly ignore your  healthy cells and instead hunt down tumors. Cancer cells are broken mutants that evolve  various ways to hide and fight back against your immune system. But as they get better  at this, they get worse at other things, like fighting back viruses. A weakness to  be exploited. Oncolytic viruses target the specific adaptations of cancer cells, hitting  them where they are not ready to be hit. And worse for these cells, since their  internal machinery is compromised, they can’t defend themselves. They are taken  over and turned into virus production factories. Eventually the new viruses leave the cancer cell,  often killing it, and carry on infecting other cancer cells nearby. This death and destruction  is not subtle, and one side effect is that it attracts immune cells that immediately  begin attacking the tumor with full force. What is even more impressive, these  viruses seem to disrupt the artificial environment that tumors create to keep  your immune system at bay. Oncolytic viruses are like infiltrators in a city  at siege, opening the gates while killing defenders left and right – helping  your immune cells to win the fight. In 2024 we don’t know yet to what degree oncolytic  viruses are part of your virome or more of a happy accident. But they seem to go well together with  chemotherapy or radiation. Eventually they may become an important new tool to enable us to  eliminate cancer and save millions of lives. We don’t know what we will learn in the  next few years, but we now know that there are trillions of potential allies within  us, killing and manipulating, for better or worse.

Oh, you hate it? You are not alone! One in four people with a tattoo  regret it, 25 million people in the US. Getting ink carved into your body permanently has exploded in popularity in the last few  decades, especially among Millennials. Often their tattoos were about a current cultural  thing, a moment in their life, following a trend, expressing individuality or about feeling  like being part of something greater. This is all fine and good but  as people age they often stop identifying with what their younger  versions wanted on their skin forever. Or sometimes their tattoos simply  just look ugly or have aged badly. And so today laser tattoo removal is booming,  being as normalized as dentist appointments. Which is wild since lasering a tattoo away is one  of the most metal things you can do to your body. A high tech procedure that is extremely painful  and makes your skin explode from the inside. How does it work? We explained what a tattoo is in  detail before, but in a nutshell: From the perspective of your cells  your tattoo is a mountain range of colourful boulders, from small to building-sized. Injected deep into your dermis by violently  ripping huge wounds with gigantic needles. Your body is trying hard to destroy  the tattoo, but the ink particles are way too large to be transported away  and your immune cells can’t eat them. So they do the next best thing: Keeping the ink trapped in a prison of flesh. This is why tattoos remain forever,  millions of your cells give their lives to keep the ink in place – when  they die new ones take their place. In principle removing a tattoo is very easy: Just destroy the ink particles. The hard part is to do that  without destroying you. Amazingly the best way is still  to blast you with a deadly laser. Lasers, UV light, wifi or  x-rays are all the same thing: Electromagnetic radiation, photons that travel through space at the  speed of light in the form of a wave. The more energetic they are, the higher their  frequency and the more punch they carry. Imagine your skin as jelly and  your tattoo as crumbs of toast. If you shine a flashlight against  it, most light passes right through the jelly – but the darker toast crumbs  absorb more light and are clearly visible. Likewise, certain laser frequencies mostly  pass through your skin without doing damage, while dark ink particles soak them up. Depending on the colour of your  tattoo, we need different lasers. Red ink reflects red light but absorbs  green light – so you need a green laser. Black ink easily absorbs all types of  light and is the easiest to remove. But even with the right colour, tattoo removal  lasers are still pretty powerful and can still leave horrible injuries, scars, or  change your skin colour permanently. So instead of shooting your skin  with a continuous ray of death, modern tattoo removal lasers shoot  an extremely brief pulse – a packet of electromagnetic energy that lasts  about a few trillionoth of a second. So short that the beam ends before  the first photon even hits the skin! Ok, enough theory. Let’s laser your mistake away and experience  the fun of tattoo removal together! But laser removal is expensive, so let’s  start by taking care of your finances. With Rocket Money – the sponsor of this  video – you can begin saving money today.

Let us slow down time… zapp The pulse of high energy photons hits  your arm nearly at the speed of light, shooting through the dead layers of  the skin, passing into the dermis. Most cells are like jelly to the  laser and don’t absorb much energy, escaping its deadly power unharmed. The flood of photons moves  on and reaches the mountain range of ink embedded deep in the  prison of your flesh and cells. Only a nanosecond, a billionth of a second,  has passed but now things escalate rapidly. As the photons hit the black ink on  a molecular level, they smash into electrons and are absorbed and annihilated –  transferring all of their energy into them. This sudden influx of energy  almost instantly turns into a massive amount of heat that has nowhere to go. The ink particles burn up to a seething hot 600  degrees, hot enough to make iron glow red hot. Overwhelmed by the sudden heat the  ink particles expand rapidly and are mechanically stressed to the max, violently  ripping and fracturing, almost exploding. The mountain range cracks into millions of  seething hot pieces and a bit of hot ink dust. Which would not be that bad if this  was not going on inside your skin. Water in your tissue and inside your cells  instantly vaporizes and expands quickly. Ripping cells apart and growing into gigantic  caves of hot steam bubbles inside your skin. This sudden expansion creates a  shockwave that hits tissue nearby, causing more mayhem and damage. Your cells that were keeping the tattoo in  place a moment ago are having a really bad time. If they had kept tattoo particles safely stowed  inside of them they are cooked or ripped apart. The cells that surrounded the ink mountains are gravely wounded or burned alive  by the sudden heat or steam. A few tiny blood vessels in the  area are ripped apart violently. Thousands of your cells are dead or hurt. And then the next laser pulse hits again, and again, moving over the tattoo  like an orbital bombardment. From your perspective all of this is happening  so fast that you only notice one thing: A sharp pain like being electrocuted, a smell like  burnt hair and most disturbingly, a loud crack. Where the laser hits your tattoo  instantly turns white – which is called frosting and is the bubbles  of hot gas expanding under your skin. To ease the pain the area is often cooled  with a stream of cold air for a moment, before the laser moves on again. Inside your skin the tattoo is now a  crushed mountain range of carnage and death. The cooked and ripped remains of cells float in a mix of hot ink and water  vapor that are cooling down. Many more cells are injured and  are chemically screaming for help. It's like an internal burn wound. The Brutal Aftermath Hundreds of thousands of  immune cells like Macrophages, stream into the wound to clean up the mess. They order inflammation so your blood  vessels open up and water rushes in. Your wounded skin starts to swell up and turn red. As your cells begin cleaning up  casualties and helping with wound healing they also meet loads of hot ink particles. It‘s now that your tattoo is  actually being removed – the same immune system that kept it in  place is now helping to clean it up. Many of the smallest particles are  simply rinsed away by the flood, while Macrophages devour some of them  and transport them to your lymph nodes. If possible they will be broken down  further and ejected from your body via your urine – if not then they will just collect  inside your lymph nodes and stay there, probably for the rest of your life. So hopefully you got the tattoo  from a pro and the ink is not toxic. But the majority of ink particles are either still  too large or there are just too many of them. So your immune and skin cells  – in a brave effort to protect you – once again swallow and bind them in place. This is why a laser tattoo removal usually  takes between 5 and 12 sessions – each time a part of the tattoo is transported away and  an even larger one is cemented in place again. You get to enjoy watching this  process happening in real time. Within the first few hours the frosting under your skin fades and the skin around the  tattoo feels like a bad sunburn. Red, swollen and stingy. Often it rises with fluid filled burn  blisters that you should leave alone. As the pain calms down it is replaced by soreness. Over the next few days the wound will remain red, swollen and tender and begin to itch –  the itching is a direct consequence of your immune cells actively healing you,  so maybe that gives you some comfort. After about a week the wound may crust over as  new healthy and pink skin replaces injured skin. Things slowly get back to normal. Your tattoo will usually be noticeably lighter, although not that much if  this was your first session. Over the next few weeks it will  get a bit lighter still as your immune system keeps transporting parts of it away. Modern laser tattoo removal has gotten very good, so if you chose an experienced professional  you should be completely healed after two months – but if you did not or if you  had the procedure done with older tech, sometimes there might be a slight scar or the  colour of your skin may change slightly in places. Although this is pretty rare nowadays, please do your research when deciding who  you’re going to allow to shoot lasers at you. In the best case, after a number of sessions, your tattoo is no longer visible,  or only very, very faintly. Whetherit will disappear completely  depends on the size of your tattoo, the colours that were used, how  deep the ink was injected and to a degree – how good of a job your  body does cleaning up the mess. New year, new you? We created a Health Journal  to set you up for success. It’s a science-based and easy  to follow framework that helps you find out what actually works for  your life – without pressure or guilt. Want to focus on your diet?

But no matter where I'm watching I find myself constantly doing this one thing. [unintelligible] What? [unintelligible] [exhasperated sigh] [unintelligible] [exhasperated sigh] [unintelligible] Oh. It turns out this isn't unusual. We polled our YouTube audience and about 57% of people said that they feel like they can't understand the dialogue in the things that they watch unless they're using subtitles. But it feels like this hasn't always been the case. So to figure out what was going on, I made a call. Hi, my name is Austin Olivia Kendrick. I am a professional dialogue editor for film and TV. I basically perform audio surgery on actors words. Do you watch with subtitles? I– I do, actually. I do a lot of the time. So... Why do you think that we all feel like we need subtitles now? I get asked this question all the time. All the time. It's something that is... It doesn't have a simple, straightforward answer. It's very layered and very complex. And after talking to Austin for almost 2 hours, it's true. It's a very layered and complex topic. But everything kept pointing back to one main thing. Technology that got us from this... –I'll get you, my pretty. –You should be kissed and often. No, Richard, no. What has happened... To this. Mom, I just woke up. ...little slim-waisted birdy... [unintelligible] Let's start with microphones. I'm going to use this clip from \"Singin in the Rain\" to show how mics used to work. Here's the mic, you talk towards it. The sound goes through the cable to the box. A man records it on a big record in wax. This scene illustrates some of the difficulties and intricacies early sound recordings. Mics were big, bulky, temperamental and required creative solutions to be hidden. They were wired and recorded onto hard memory like wax and eventually tape. No matter how many actors were in a scene all sound got recorded to one track. So performers had to be diligently focused and facing a certain angle so that their words could be picked up. Otherwise... [muted noise, as if from far away] [sudden sound up] [muted noise, as if from far away] [sudden sound up] You couldn't hear a thing. But technology's improved to the point where microphones don't impede performance as much anymore. They become better, smaller, wireless... and we use more of them to ensure that performances get captured. What we typically are working with from production dialogue is 2 boom microphones and then every actor has at least one lavaliere microphone hidden somewhere on them. These shrinking mics have given actors the flexibility to be more naturalistic in their performances. They no longer need to project so that their words reach the mic. They can speak softly, knowing that the tiny mic hidden on their body will pick up what they're saying. And my personal favorite example of this performance shift is Alec Baldwin on 30 Rock. In a 2011 speech slash roast, Tina Fey says that \"He speaks so quietly that she can't hear him when she's standing next to him.\" \"And then you play the film back and it's there somehow.\" Just listen to this whisper off between him and Will Arnett. I'm not afraid of you. Yeah. Well, you should be. Let's just see how it all shakes out in the meeting. Naturalism isn't always the best for intelligibility, though. Take Tom Hardy, an actor that I personally love but who famously is a mumbler. ???????????? I mean... the mic picked that line up fine. Like we can definitely hear that he's talking he's saying something. But once that mumble gets recorded it's on to a dialog editor's shoulder to make it as intelligible as possible. And that was a lot harder when everything was analog. While you could pick the best takes and physically splice them together. If some piece of dialog was truly impossible to understand then actors will come in and rerecord those specific lines in a process called ADR or automated dialog replacement which you can see Meryl Streep do in this scene from \"Postcards from the Edge\". There isn't enough money in the world to further cause like yours That still gets done today, but.. ADR also costs money because you're not only paying for the actors time you're paying for the engineer's time and then the editor's time. So we try to do ADR, frankly, as little as possible. And so a lot of her job is making words sound better. The show I'm currently working on I remember in the middle of this one word there was just this loud metal clang that I couldn't remove. So I had to go in and I had to find an alternate take of it that fit and then I had to fit it... to the movement of her mouth in that moment and then push it in. And once she's done with it it's sent off to a mixer who works to make sure the frequencies of the sound effects and music don't overlap with the frequencies of the human voice something that's only possible now that the world has moved away from tape and into digital recordings. That is a big challenge. Carving out those frequencies, that space... amongst every other element of the mix for the dialogue to be able to punch through and not be all muddied up by any other sounds that exist in that band of frequencies. But even with all that work lines of dialog can still be hard to understand. The kind of feeling has been if you want your movie to feel quote unquote cinematic you have to have wall-to-wall bombastic, loud sound. A lot of people will ask like \"Why don't you just turn the dialog up?\" Like, just turn it up. And... if only it was that simple. Because a big thing that we want to preserve is a concept called dynamic range. The range between your quietest sound and your loudest sound. If you have your dialog, that's going to be at the same volume as an explosion that immediately follows it. The explosion is not going to feel as big. You need that contrast in volume in order to give your ear a sense of scale. But the thing is, you can only make something so loud before it gets distorted. So if you want to create that wide dynamic range you have no choice but to push those quieter sounds lower instead of pushing the louder sounds louder. So explosions go up and dialog comes down. Which brings us to the Christopher Nolan of it all. [loud music layered over] A seperate structure within the others— [Tom Hardy mumbling into a face mask] [rocket blasters layered over] Pushing out of orbit! Nearly every film of his has been criticized for its hard to hear dialogue that essentially begs for subtitles. But as as this headline explains, he likes it that way. According to an interview in a book called The Nolan Variations he said that he gets a lot of complaints. Even from other filmmakers who would say \"I just saw your film and the dialogue is inaudible.\" \"The truth was it was kind of the whole enchilada of how we had chosen to mix it.\" And in his 2017 interview with Indiewire, he said \"We made the decision a couple of films ago that we weren't going to mix films for substandard theaters\" And this is kind of the crux of the matter. The content that we watch here and here and here is not mixed for us, primarily. Rerecording mixers mix for the widest surround sound format that is available typically like big release films. That is Dolby Atmos.... which has true 3D sound up to 128 channels. The thing is, if you're not at a movie theater that can showcase the best sound Hollywood has to offer... you can't experience all of those channels. So after the movie is mixed for the 128 Atmos tracks somebody has to create a separate version of the film's audio where all those same sounds live on one or two or five tracks. This is called downmixing. Downmixing is the process of taking that biggest mix and folding it down into formats with lesser channels available to it. So say Atmos down to 7.1 or 7.1 down to 5.1 or 5.1 down to stereo stereo down to mono. Unlike old TVs that were gigantic and had a ton of space for speakers TVs today are super thin like this one that I have in my living room is about the same thickness as my iPhone. So even though it's outputting the same mono or stereo sound that an older TV might, it's still going to sound worse because you have to have tiny little speakers to fit into this tiny, sleek form factor. These tiny speakers are also usually on the back of the TV. So the downmixed version of this movie that went from 128 channels down to just 2 is going to sound even muddier when it's pointing away from you. And when you're watching on your phone or a laptop... it's generally not much better. When you combine not great speakers, naturalistic mumbly performances dynamic range featuring bombastic sound over dialogue and a flattened mix... It's no wonder we have trouble hearing what's going on. And it seems like the industry knows this because TVs today are shipping with all kinds of settings built in like this intelligence mode. You can put on active voice amplification in hopes of making that dialog track come through just a little bit clear. But of course, that's more band aid than it is solution. The way movies get mixed likely isn't going to revert back to super pristine dialogue. So the solutions we have are, one: Buy better speakers and only go to theaters that have impeccable sound. Two: take a chill pill and try to just worry a little bit less about picking up every single word that gets said. Or, three... Just keep the subtitles on. For people who are deaf or hard of hearing subtitles make movies and TV shows accessible and this accessibility has just expanded in recent years. Laws have been passed to ensure that movie theaters have at least a few screenings a week with captions. Pretty much every streaming service has standardized them and speech recognition technology has made them accessible in pretty much every YouTube video and TikTok.

"language": "en", "content": "At the height of the 2016 election researchers released a report warning about a strange propaganda technique. Another day, another lie, another conspiracy theory, another falsehood. They called it the \"firehose of falsehood.\" When a propagandist bombards people with more lies than they can possibly keep up. Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? According to the report, these lies don't have to be believable. It wasn't just a lie. It was such a bad obvious lie. Researchers found that even obvious lies had the potential to be highly effective at shaping public opinion. I mean he just says things and then they are the truth in the world of the Donald. The thing is, that report wasn't about Trump. It didn't even mention him. It was about Russian propaganda. And it raised an interesting question: How could a powerful leader benefit from telling obvious lies? We've signed more bills than any president ever. The president just simply lies for no reason. I was against the war in Iraq. Why lie about something that you don't have to lie about? You have people registered in two states. They vote twice. Why does he keep repeating it if it's obviously not true? We're going to get to Trump in a minute. Hell yeah! But before that, we have to talk to Christopher Paul. I'm a senior social scientist at the RAND Corporation. He co-wrote the report on Russian firehosing and he described it as having four key characteristics. Russian propaganda is high volume and multichannel. It's rapid, continuous, and repetitive. It makes no commitment to objective reality. And it makes no commitment to consistency. Oooh, sounds like Trump. Can you give me a second? I'm building a narrative here. The first two characteristics are pretty standard for propaganda. Research shows that if we hear a lie from multiple sources, we think of it as more credible. The same is true for lies we hear repeatedly. The more familiar we are with a lie, the more likely we are to think of it as true. But the last two characteristics — no commitment to objective reality or consistency — that's surprising. They don't care that much about the truth. Much of their propaganda is either completely false or has a kernel of truth. Maybe the most jarring example this was in 2014, when the world watched as Russian troops entered Ukraine. There were a bunch of Russian soldiers wearing uniforms without insignia and those were dubbed “little green men.” This was a huge deal. Russia was essentially invading a country they had said they were not going to invade. But when Putin was asked about it: Were these Russian soldiers? No. These were local self-defense forces. Putin vehemently denied. “No no, the little green men are not Russian soldiers.” It wasn't just that Putin was lying. He was lying about something so obvious. There was footage of the soldiers airing on TV. Russian troops spreading out throughout the strategic Crimean Peninsula. And then, a few weeks later, he just said the opposite. Of course, we had our servicemen. They were acting very correctly. No “I'm sorry.” No “I misspoke.” Just, “Of course we have troops there.” This is counterintuitive. This is not what I expected. I come from an influence background that says credibility is king and the truth will always win. Part of being a good liar is not getting caught. Making sure your lies are at least somewhat believable. When Dick Cheney said, \"There is no doubt Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,\" he was lying, but to most people who aren't intelligence experts, it sounded credible. If someone asks, \"Hey did you eat my sandwich?\" You'd say, \"Nope. I brought my lunch from home.\" You wouldn't say, \"You never had a sandwich.\" But when it comes the firehosing, believability doesn't really matter. I think being willing to not be seen as credible is okay with the Russians. We'll come back to this. But right now it's TRUMP TIME! Trump time. Since the election, people have pointed out that Trump uses firehosing too. I really had no view that this would be anything that anyone would think about applying to American politics. That's not what I'm about. I am concerned with foreign intervention in our political processes. Okay, fine. Donovan, bring in the second interview please. Thank you. I think it can be deceptive just how different they look. But despite the different styles, I think they do the exact same thing. This is Masha Gessen. She's a Russian-American journalist, activist, and all around badass. And she's been warning about the similarities between Trump and Putin for years. They just create sort of this unmanageable volume of falsehood. Gessen argues that firehosing — telling and retelling obvious lies — isn't about persuasion. It's about power. When Putin says there are no troops in Crimea or when Trump says he never mocked a disabled reporter, they're not just lying. They're asserting that they are not constrained by reality. That everything, even things that are totally obvious to us, can be challenged. That's a very clear demonstration of power. You have to engage with what he said even though it's false. Those last two features a firehosing — the shamelessness, the inconsistency — they're kind of the point. The way that they lie that makes the obviousness of the lie part of the powerplay. Yes, I know that you know what I'm saying is absurd, and I assert my right to say whatever I want whenever I want to. He keeps urinating on the sidewalk and we have to keep wiping it up. Not the sidewalk, the living room rug. Yeah. On the rug! What are you cheering for right now? Our knee-jerk reaction to lies like this is to fact-check them. Fact checkers are having a field day with this one. President Obama did not found ISIS. He was not wiretapped, there was no warrant out. It is not the biggest tax cut in US history as the fact-checkers have noted. But if the goal of firehosing is to assert power, fact-checking misses the point. There is nothing quite so humiliating and disempowering as trying to prove the truth. Think of a schoolyard bully who says, \"Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?\" Degrading you by forcing you to argue with the obvious. \"Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?\" Yeah, you'd know about being bullied. I sure would. Thank you. And I think that's kind of what it feels like when we fact-check Trump. It's sullying. You feel like you've engaged with something that actually shouldn't be a part of the public sphere. Firehosing turns even the most obvious of facts into a messy, mind-numbing political fight. Every time he gets fact-checked Trump lashes out. They just don't want to report the truth. Sarah Sanders blames the media. If anything has been inflamed it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media. And something that should not have even been up for debate starts to look like just another screaming match where no one really seems credible. Donald Trump lies and he lies compulsively. So this very simple human assumption that you can know what's true, that assumption is taken away from you. You have to work for the truth and the hope is that, yeah, you'll get exhausted and you'll eventually give up. I'm getting depressed. I know, buddy. I'm almost done. We're all almost done. The ultimate goal of firehosing isn't to pass lies off as truth. It's to rob concepts like facts and reality of their power. You stand by that claim about him? I don't stand by anything. I have my own opinions, you can have your own opinions. To reduce truth to just a position. Isn't it important just to, like, have factual debates when discussing these things? Well, as you just commented, there's lots of different ways of looking at it. You're saying it's a falsehood and they're giving alternative facts. It's somebody's version of the truth, not the truth. Truth is truth. I don't mean to go like... No it isn't truth. Truth isn't truth. And if that sounds a little abstract, just listen to what Putin said during his press conference with Trump in July. As to who is to be believed, you can trust no one. He defends the interests of the United States of America. And I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. So Putin just basically wanted to establish as a baseline that no one can be trusted. Everybody's pursuing their own strategic interests and there's no such thing as the truth. And a few days later Trump took that argument a step further. And just remember, what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening. Just stick with us. Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. Just stick with us. Essentially, reality is about picking sides. They're basically saying there's no war between people who know the truth and people who are lying. There's only positional warfare. Whoever has a better position. Whoever has objectively more power owns reality. And it's remarkable how effective that is. Maybe you can just start acting like you have total power and it will not exactly give you total power but it will give you a hell of a lot more power than an American president should have. You never had a sandwich. You never had a... Come on man, you're killing me. Don't look at him if you don't have to. You never had... we have to unmic him. All right.

Now, you’ll need to use that timing to help you break out of jail. At the appointed time, you’ll be walking in the yard near the electric fence. Your partner will flash you the signal, and exactly 45 seconds later, short out the fence circuit. It’ll automatically restart after a second or two, but as long as you move fast, you’ll be home free. And then you notice, to your horror, that your watch is broken, and there’s no time to fix it. The signal is coming, and if you make even a small mistake in counting off 45 seconds, you’ll get fried. Searching your pockets, you find something that might help: a lighter and two fuses you made earlier in the prison work program. Each fuse is a length of flammable twine, built to be lit on either end and burn for precisely one minute. The problem is that even though the fuses look uniform, they don’t burn evenly, so if you cut one in half, for example, one side might burn longer than the other. Your partner is going to give the signal any minute, and you’ll have to make your move. How can you use the fuses and lighter to time exactly 45 seconds? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The length of the fuse may not tell you anything, but you do know the fuses take exactly 60 seconds to burn from end to end. Here’s the key insight: If you start a fuse on one side and it burns for 30 seconds, there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left. If you had started it from the other end, it would’ve reached the exact same spot in thirty seconds. That means that if you lit it from both ends simultaneously, it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds. But how will you time the last fifteen? That’ll have to come from the second fuse. If it were a 30 second fuse, you’d be able to use that same trick again to double the burning speed and make it last exactly 15 seconds. And, you realize, you can shorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time as you light the first. At the moment the first burns out, you’ll be left with 30 seconds on the second fuse. Just when you’ve got this all figured out, you see the signal from your partner, and spring into action. You gather the four ends of the two fuses and light three of them. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end of the second fuse.

AI Could Save (Not Destroy) Education | Sal Khan | TED", "language": "en", "content": "So anyone who's been paying attention for the last few months has been seeing headlines like this, especially in education. The thesis has been: students are going to be using ChatGPT and other forms of AI to cheat, do their assignments. They’re not going to learn. And it’s going to completely undermine education as we know it. Now, what I'm going to argue today is not only are there ways to mitigate all of that, if we put the right guardrails, we do the right things, we can mitigate it. But I think we're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen. And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor. And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing, artificially intelligent teaching assistant. And just to appreciate how big of a deal it would be to give everyone a personal tutor, I show you this clip from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study, or he called it the “2 sigma problem.” The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation, sigma, the symbol for standard deviation. And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution, that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out, that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students, then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right. It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks, like, that right distribution, a two standard-deviation improvement. Just to put that in plain language, that could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student. It can take your below-average student and turn them into an above-average student. Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said, well, this is all good, but how do you actually scale group instruction this way? How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way? What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that. Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way at Khan Academy for over a decade now, but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically. I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI, which we call Khanmigo, what it can now do and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going. So this right over here is a traditional exercise that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy. But what's new is that little bot thing at the right. And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards, which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher. It’s moderated actually by a second AI. And also it does not tell you the answer. It is not a cheating tool. When the student says, \"Tell me the answer,\" it says, \"I'm your tutor. What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?\" Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people who think large language models are not good at mathematics, notice, not only does it notice the mistake, it asks the student to explain their reasoning, but it's actually doing what I would say, not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do. It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind, that they probably didn’t use the distributive property. Remember, we need to distribute the negative two to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses. This to me is a very, very, very big deal. And it's not just in math. This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy, where the student needs to make the clouds part. And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus. It only made the left cloud part. But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on? Why is only the left cloud moving? And it understands the code. It knows all the context of what the student is doing, and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds, which I think is kind of mind-blowing. And it says, \"To make the right cloud move as well, try adding a line of code inside the draw function that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame.\" Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers. We've all been trying to teach the world to code, but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there. And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my kids, when they're learning to code, I can't help them this well, this fast, this is really going to be a super tutor. And it's not just exercises. It understands what you're watching. It understands the context of your video. It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?” And it asks Socratically, \"Well, what do you care about?\" And let's say the student says, \"I want to be a professional athlete.\" And it says, \"Well, learning about the size of cells, which is what this video is, that could be really useful for understanding nutrition and how your body works, etc.\" It can answer questions, it can quiz you, it can connect it to other ideas, you can now ask as many questions of a video as you could ever dream of. (Applause) Another big shortage out there, I remember the high school I went to, the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one. A lot of the country, it's worse than that. We can use Khanmigo to give every student a guidance counselor, academic coach, career coach, life coach, which is exactly what you see right over here. And we launched this with the GPT-4 launch. We have a few thousand people on this. This isn't a fake demo, this is really it in action. And then there is, you know, things that I think it would have been even harder, it would have been a little science fiction to do with even a traditional tutor. We run an online high school with Arizona State University called Khan World School, and we have a student who attends that online school, based in India. Her name's Saanvi. And she was doing a report on \"The Great Gatsby.\" And when she was reading \"The Great Gatsby,\" Jay Gatsby keeps looking at the green light off into the distance. And she's like, \"Why does he do that?\" She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this and commented about the symbolism of that, but none of it was really resonating with her. And then she realized that she had Khanmigo and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself. And so, \"Ah, splendid choice, old sport. I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.” And so, \"Why do you keep staring at the green light?\" \"Ah, the green light, old sport. It's a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see. It's situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock across the bay from my mansion. I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life.\" And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,” she called him “Mr. Gatsby,” and at the end she actually apologized for taking his time, which I thought was very polite of her. But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ... You could talk to historical figures. We're even probably going to add an activity you can talk to like, the Mississippi River. It brings things to life in ways that really were science fiction even six months or a year ago. Students can get into debates with the AI. And we’ve got this here is the student debating whether we should cancel student debt. The student is against canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback. We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have, Khan Lab School. The students, the high school students especially, they're saying \"This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment. It makes me that much more confident to go into the classroom and really participate.\" And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn, but frankly, it's not out there for most students. But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone. A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been, \"It's going to do the writing for kids. Kids are not going to learn to write.\" But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you. So this is a little thing, and my eight year old is addicted to this, and he's not a kid that really liked writing before, but you can say, “I want to write a horror story,” and it says, \"Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling. Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows and chilling mysteries.\" And this is an activity where the student will write two sentences, and then the AI will write two sentences. And so they collaborate together on a story. The student writes, \"Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost. She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident.\" And the AI says, \"Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship. One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion,\" etc. I encourage you all to hopefully one day try this. This is surprisingly fun. Now to even more directly hit this use case. And what I'm about to show you, everything I showed you so far is actually already part of Khanmigo, and what I’m about to show you, we haven't shown to anyone yet, this is a prototype. We hope to be able to launch it in the next few months, but this is to directly use AI, use generative AI, to not undermine English and language arts but to actually enhance it in ways that we couldn't have even conceived of even a year ago. This is reading comprehension. The students reading Steve Jobs's famous speech at Stanford. And then as they get to certain points, they can click on that little question. And the AI will then Socratically, almost like an oral exam, ask the student about things. And the AI can highlight parts of the passage. Why did the author use that word? What was their intent? Does it back up their argument? They can start to do stuff that once again, we never had the capability to give everyone a tutor, everyone a writing coach to actually dig in to reading at this level. And you could go on the other side of it. And we have whole work flows that helps them write, helps them be a writing coach, draw an outline. But once a student actually constructs a draft, and this is where they're constructing a draft, they can ask for feedback once again, as you would expect from a good writing coach. In this case, the student will say, let's say, \"Does my evidence support my claim?\" And then the AI, not only is able to give feedback, but it's able to highlight certain parts of the passage and says, \"On this passage, this doesn't quite support your claim,\" but once again, Socratically says, \"Can you tell us why?\" So it's pulling the student, making them a better writer, giving them far more feedback than they've ever been able to actually get before. And we think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it. Now, everything I've talked about so far is for the student. But we think this could be equally as powerful for the teacher to drive more personalized education and frankly save time and energy for themselves and for their students. So this is an American history exercise on Khan Academy. It's a question about the Spanish-American War. And at first it's in student mode. And if you say, “Tell me the answer,” it’s not going to tell the answer. It's going to go into tutoring mode. But that little toggle which teachers have access to, they can turn student mode off and then it goes into teacher mode. And what this does is it turns into -- You could view it as a teacher's guide on steroids. Not only can it explain the answer, it can explain how you might want to teach it. It can help prepare the teacher for that material. It can help them create lesson plans, as you could see doing right there. It'll eventually help them create progress reports and help them, eventually, grade. So once again, teachers spend about half their time with this type of activity, lesson planning. All of that energy can go back to them or go back to human interactions with their actual students. (Applause) So, you know, one point I want to make. These large language models are so powerful, there's a temptation to say like, well, all these people are just going to slap them onto their websites, and it kind of turns the applications themselves into commodities. And what I've got to tell you is that’s one of the reasons why I didn’t sleep for two weeks when I first had access to GPT-4 back in August. But we quickly realized that to actually make it magical, I think what you saw with Khanmigo a little bit, it didn't interact with you the way that you see ChatGPT interacting. It was a little bit more magical, it was more Socratic, it was clearly much better at math than what most people are used to thinking. And the reason is, there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen. And I could go through the whole list of everything we've been working on, many, many people for over six, seven months to make it feel magical. But perhaps the most intellectually interesting one is we realized, and this was an idea from an OpenAI researcher, that we could dramatically improve its ability in math and its ability in tutoring if we allow the AI to think before it speaks. So if you're tutoring someone and you immediately just start talking before you assess their math, you might not get it right. But if you construct thoughts for yourself, and what you see on the right there is an actual AI thought, something that it generates for itself but it does not share with the student. then its accuracy went up dramatically, and its ability to be a world-class tutor went up dramatically. And you can see it's talking to itself here. It says, \"The student got a different answer than I did, but do not tell them they made a mistake. Instead, ask them to explain how they got to that step.\" So I'll just finish off, hopefully, you know, what I’ve just shown you is just half of what we are working on, and we think this is just the very tip of the iceberg of where this can actually go. And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't have been even a year ago, that we together have a chance of addressing the 2 sigma problem and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity, dramatically accelerating education as we know it. Now, just to take a step back at a meta level, obviously we heard a lot today, the debates on either side. There's folks who take a more pessimistic view of AI, they say this is scary, there's all these dystopian scenarios, we maybe want to slow down, we want to pause. On the other side, there are the more optimistic folks that say, well, we've gone through inflection points before, we've gone through the Industrial Revolution. It was scary, but it all kind of worked out. And what I'd argue right now is I don't think this is like a flip of a coin or this is something where we'll just have to, like, wait and see which way it turns out. I think everyone here and beyond, we are active participants in this decision. I'm pretty convinced that the first line of reasoning is actually almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, that if we act with fear and if we say, \"Hey, we've just got to stop doing this stuff,\" what's really going to happen is the rule followers might pause, might slow down, but the rule breakers, as Alexandr [Wang] mentioned, the totalitarian governments, the criminal organizations, they're only going to accelerate. And that leads to what I am pretty convinced is the dystopian state, which is the good actors have worse AIs than the bad actors. But I'll also, you know, talk to the optimists a little bit. I don't think that means that, oh, yeah, then we should just relax and just hope for the best. That might not happen either. I think all of us together have to fight like hell to make sure that we put the guardrails, we put in -- when the problems arise -- reasonable regulations. But we fight like hell for the positive use cases. Because very close to my heart, and obviously there's many potential positive use cases, but perhaps the most powerful use case and perhaps the most poetic use case is if AI, artificial intelligence, can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. Thank you.

I show you this clip from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study, or he called it the “2 sigma problem.” The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation, sigma, the symbol for standard deviation.", "And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution, that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out, that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students, then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right.", "It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks, like, that right distribution, a two standard-deviation improvement.", "Just to put that in plain language, that could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student.", "It can take your below-average student and turn them into an above-average student.", "Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said, well, this is all good, but how do you actually scale group instruction this way?", "How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way?", "What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that.", "Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way at Khan Academy for over a decade now, but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically.", "I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI, which we call Khanmigo, what it can now do and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going.", "So this right over here is a traditional exercise that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy.", "But what's new is that little bot thing at the right.", "And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards, which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher.", "It’s moderated actually by a second AI.", "And also it does not tell you the answer.", "It is not a cheating tool.", "When the student says, \"Tell me the answer,\" it says, \"I'm your tutor.", "What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?\" Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people who think large language models are not good at mathematics, notice, not only does it notice the mistake, it asks the student to explain their reasoning, but it's actually doing what I would say, not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do.", "It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind, that they probably didn’t use the distributive property.", "Remember, we need to distribute the negative two to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses.", "This to me is a very, very, very big deal.", "And it's not just in math.", "This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy, where the student needs to make the clouds part.", "And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus.", "It only made the left cloud part.", "But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on?", "Why is only the left cloud moving?", "And it understands the code.", "It knows all the context of what the student is doing, and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds, which I think is kind of mind-blowing.", "And it says, \"To make the right cloud move as well, try adding a line of code inside the draw function that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame.\" Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers.", "We've all been trying to teach the world to code, but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there.", "And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my kids, when they're learning to code, I can't help them this well, this fast, this is really going to be a super tutor.", "And it's not just exercises.", "It understands what you're watching.", "It understands the context of your video.", "It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?” And it asks Socratically, \"Well, what do you care about?\" And let's say the student says, \"I want to be a professional athlete.\" And it says, \"Well, learning about the size of cells, which is what this video is, that could be really useful for understanding nutrition and how your body works, etc.\" It can answer questions, it can quiz you, it can connect it to other ideas, you can now ask as many questions of a video as you could ever dream of.", "(Applause) Another big shortage out there, I remember the high school I went to, the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one.", "A lot of the country, it's worse

GPT-4 launch.", "We have a few thousand people on this.", "This isn't a fake demo, this is really it in action.", "And then there is, you know, things that I think it would have been even harder, it

light off into the distance.", "And she's like, \"Why does he do that?\" She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this and commented about the symbolism of that, but none of it was really resonating with her.", "And then she realized that she had Khanmigo and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself.", "And so, \"Ah, splendid choice, old sport.", "I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F.", "Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.” And so, \"Why do you keep staring at the green light?\" \"Ah, the green light, old sport.", "It's a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see.", "It's situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock across the bay from my mansion.", "I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life.\" And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,” she called him “Mr.", "Gatsby,” and at the end she actually apologized for taking his time, which I thought was very polite of her.", "But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ...", "You could talk to historical figures.", "We're even probably going to add an activity you can talk to

here is the student debating whether we should cancel student debt.", "The student is against canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback.", "We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have, Khan Lab School.", "The students, the high school students especially, they're saying \"This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment.", "It makes me that much more confident to go into the classroom and really participate.\" And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn, but frankly, it's not out there for most students.", "But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone.", "A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been, \"It's going to do the writing for kids.", "Kids are not going to learn to write.\" But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you.", "So this is a little thing, and my eight year old is addicted to this, and he's not a kid that really liked writing before, but you can say, “I want to write a horror story,” and it says, \"Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling.", "Let's dive into the world

- TED-Ed", "language": "en", "content": "Translator: Jennifer Cody Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: \"Be more confident.\" And most likely, this is what you think when you hear it: \"If only it were that simple.\" But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable, worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously to face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors that impact confidence. One: what you're born with, such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance of neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures of your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about and respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle these three factors, but the personal choices we make certainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate our own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you an immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music with deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose or give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: believe in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think about your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed, like a muscle? These beliefs matter because they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered something you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get stronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better in the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by twelve different publishers before one picked up \"Harry Potter.\" The Wright Brothers built on history's failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk, stand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge and understanding. This is confidence.", "sentences": ["Translator: Jennifer Cody Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this

Perhaps a day of friendly competition will lead us to the answer. Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash— ten teams of two competing in a decathlon of mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles. I’ve been training all year. I’ll need to pick the smartest, most capable teammate. I’ve narrowed down the roster. First we have Gabriela. She may only be 8, but don’t underestimate her! She’s fluent in two languages and is the ultimate outside-the-box thinker. Then there’s Ama. She can recite 100 digits of pi, designs satellites for a living, and bakes a perfect soufflé. Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He’s the best chess player in the neighborhood, not to mention he’s competed in over 20 Brain Clashes and is a five-time champion! I’m not sure who to pick! Who’s the smartest? Which of these teammates should Amir choose for tomorrow's contest and why? Of course, it depends. While intelligence is often associated with things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture the scope and depth of a person’s varied abilities. So instead, we’ll break down the idea of “smart” into categories like creativity, memory, and learning and explore when the brain’s best at each of them. Let's start at the very beginning. In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible rapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural connections are formed every second. As the brain develops, it goes through a pruning process. Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened and unused connections are removed. Frequently used neuronal pathways are myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, allowing information to travel faster. This creates a more efficient, fine-tuned brain. But this brain remodeling happens within and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills to flourish at different ages. For example, in childhood, brain regions involved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can learn and master multiple languages. Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop. As a result, some young children may struggle with strategic games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, planning, and abstract thought. At the same time, children tend to be more flexible, exploration-based learners. They often use more creative approaches when finding solutions to riddles and are, on average, less afraid to make mistakes. But adults have their own unique set of abilities. Adults benefit from a well-developed prefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills that require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient puzzle solvers or crossword masters. Late in adulthood, these same skills may decline as the brain’s memory center, known as the hippocampus, shrinks. But there’s a reason for the phrase “older and wiser.” After a lifetime of learning, older adults have more knowledge to recall and utilize, making them excellent trivia partners. Other factors that Amir should consider are his own strengths. As an adolescent, the prefrontal cortical regions of your brain are more developed than in childhood. This allows you to better navigate logic and math puzzles. Simultaneously, deep inside the brain, regions that are important in motivation and reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers like Amir to be curious and adventurous learners. In many ways, you can think of the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains wired to seek out new experiences  and learn quickly. You’re at a dynamic stage, where the choices you make and the skills you focus on can actually guide the development of your brain. So, what’s the smartest age? There’s no single answer. It’s 8, 16, 25, 65, and everything in between; our brains have adapted to prioritize different skills at various ages to meet that stage of life’s challenges and demands.

Salas", "language": "en", "content": "In the 1970s, psychoanalyst Samuel Dunkell proposed a curious, albeit almost completely unsubstantiated, theory that the position you sleep in reflects your personality. For example, preferring to snooze in the so-called royal position indicated self-confidence, while sleeping semi-fetal meant you’re sensible and well adjusted. While Dunkell’s ideas lack any definitive proof, how we sleep can impact our health. So, what’s the best position to sleep in? Sleep positions go by countless creative names— the zombie, mountain climber, free faller, and soldier— yet sleep experts typically simplify them into four basic types: left side, right side, stomach, or back. Until the age of one, it is recommended that babies sleep on their backs to lower their risk of choking and suffocation. As young children, we start to move around more in our sleep, usually ending up on our sides and backs. And this tendency to avoid sleeping on our stomachs only grows with age. By adulthood, most people prefer side-sleeping, while fewer favor back-sleeping, and stomach-sleeping is the least preferred overall. But of course, individual sleep styles are highly personal: some people are sworn belly sleepers, while others can't nod off unless they're sprawled out on their backs. How we spend the night affects our bodies in several ways. Different sleep postures shift the relative positions of our internal organs, which can either relieve or worsen certain health issues. Others can leave the spine unsupported, straining nearby tissue, and preventing the muscles in the back, hips, or neck from fully relaxing. This can then lead to tension and stiffness in the morning. Take, for example, the least popular position: sleeping prone. Of the four, this also tends to be the least recommended by sleep experts, as it's thought to stretch the natural curvature of your spine. Yet there are unique situations when lying on your stomach may be beneficial. For patients with certain respiratory conditions, for example, it allows the back of the lungs to expand more freely. Sleeping on your back, on the other hand, is often preferred by those with lower back pain. When paired with a small pillow under the knees, this position allows the spine to maintain its natural curve. However, it may be less than ideal for your sleep partner. For some people, lying on their back can cause the soft tissues of the throat and tongue to collapse into the airway. Then, as the body tries to pull air through, these tissues vibrate, creating the sound we call snoring. This is also why people with sleep apnea are often told to avoid this position. This condition already involves pauses in breathing, and back sleeping can increase the likelihood that the airway collapses completely, blocking airflow. Today, most experts generally recommend side-sleeping, particularly when combined with a pillow between the knees, to better align the spine. But as it turns out, which side you lie on may make a difference. For example, studies show that sleeping on the left side often reduces heartburn symptoms for those with acid reflux. Your stomach is primarily located on the left side of your body, so this position situates it below the esophagus, allowing gravity to naturally keep stomach acid from flowing back up. However, for people with congestive heart failure, who often have an enlarged left ventricle, sleeping on the right side can help relieve chest pressure and improve their overall quality of sleep. Clearly, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. And attempting to reap the benefits of any one position can be tough, since most people shift positions 20 to 30 times per night without even knowing it. Pillows and other sleep training devices can help you stay in one place. But fortunately, unless you have a specific concern, sleep movement isn't always a bad thing. It's how your body naturally relieves pressure, responds to discomfort, and ultimately prevents injury. So, the next time you find yourself drifting to the free faller, soldier, or zombie, you can rest assured.", "sentences": ["In the 1970s, psychoanalyst Samuel Dunkell proposed a curious, albeit almost
