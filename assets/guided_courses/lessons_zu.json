I didn't know the answer. Where are you? Siboniso bought me chocolate this morning. Hey there. You know, I wasn't well this morning. I woke up with a bad tummy-- Hey there. You know, I wasn't well this morning. I woke up with such a bad headache. I don't know what's wrong. Oh, shame, get better friend. The principal was also looking for you. But I told her you might be sick. You idot. You're such an idiot! What's your problem? Why would you say that? Now she's going to bother me for a doctor's letter. How am I going to get that now? You idiot. You can't keep your mouth shut. Can I please see Sonke Nzimande? - And who are you? - His neice. - His neice? - Yes. Goodmorning. I've come to see Sonke Nzimande. - Sonke Nzimande? Your name Ma'am? - I'm Phum'la Nzimande. His wife. Oh, Sonke Nzimande. He has been admitted here. Walk down this passage, take a left turn and you will see the first door. He's in ward 42. Thank you. - Can I come back tomorrow? - Tomorrow will still be the same. The same what? Go to school before I call your parents. What do my parents have to do with this? - Why doesn't Sonke's wife know you? - Where are you getting this from? - Don't come and cause trouble in this hospital. - You don’t know how to do your job. - Are you related to sonke? Then leave before I phone the police and your parents! My parents? Go back to school before I call your parents. You have some attitude. Get out of here. Don't be confused by my uniform. I'm old. No, we were just wondering. Hold on guys. I'll be back Hey you. Where's your sister today? What's wrong? Your mouth full of vetkoek? Faggot. You've been avoiding me. What's the problem? Don’t piss me off, I will end you now! Get out of here you bitch. The sweet comes from a snake? Mhm. So I'm eating a snake? Ntando, go do your homework. I've done it. Your teacher is always asking me why you don't do your homework. Your teacher asked me why you were not at school today. Excuse me? Mhm. I learnt a new song at school. I am tired of your nonsense. I'm tired of you. (Singing) We're children of the temple (Singing) We have no despair. It’s your landlady open up! I will kick this door down if you do not open. - What is this noise I keep hearing? - No, Nobuhle didn't want to eat. Oh, no problem my child. I brought some food for you. Now go dish up for the children. Okay. I want my money though. Can I give you your money next week? I'm not running a Mandela Foundation here. I make money. I want my rent. - How much is in here? - 250 for 3 days. Please take this money,. You will get the rest next week. Thank you. Don't start with me. Ntando! Ntando! Ntando!

Ntando! - Why aren't you at school? - Why aren't you? - I can't find Buhle. - So what are you doing here? Excuse me? You lost her, you go find her yourself. The sweets! Buhle! Where is it? - Where is it Nosihle? - I put it here. Pick her up. Fortunately you brought her in time. We'll still just run a few tests when she wakes up. Hawu! You're back so soon? Don't start with me. Are you pregnant? Excuse me? - Why weren't you at school? - What's that gotto do with you? I knew it... You're pregnant. What do you take me for? Do you really believe that I would fall pregnant for fun? What do you want me to say? You are the oldest but you might as well be as old as Buhle. You don't know what you're doing and you don't know what I need. All you care about is your taxi rank boys. Mom and Dad do not know the struggle they left me with. Your struggle? How many of us were born from our mother’s womb? Answer me, brain box. Since you know everything. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have to run after those rank boys. You have food to eat and clothes to wear because of them. You survive because of them. Thank you. Who did you fight with? - Me? - Who else am I talking to? Why wern't you at school? - You are limping, you need to see the doctor. - I'm OK. Don't think that you can just get into fights at school and expect me to be your doctor. I didn't fight anybody. So you fell? Who hit you? Nobody hit me. You get beaten up everyday but not today? Skinny makes me his wife at school... Break time is our time, But this morning... That all changed. Nosi. Get her a sweet. I know which ones she likes. - Hello. - How are you, sisi? I'm well. How much are your snake sweets? - R9, sisi. - Eish, I only have R7. Hawu, Nosihle? How did you know that I was being discharged today? I didn’t know, I just brought in my sister. Oh, that's a pity. Come, let’s go outside. I want to show you something. Come Sonke. You just survived a car accident. I've been trying to get hold of you since yesterday about the thing you wanted to meet about. Just my luck that you turned up here. I just want to... celebrate with my person. - I don't want to celebrate with you. - Exuse me? I don’t want you and your money. I don’t want you. - But it’s still full. - That’s because I sell better than her. Oh please. Serious. One day with the vetkoeks and you could not even sell one.
