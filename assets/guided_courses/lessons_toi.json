John is my neighbor  that I met and we always greeting each other in Tonga so it will be about the Tonga people the  Tonga language and about John's own experiences  enjoy Tonga is a local language in Zimbabwe the  language that is spoken most is Shona then Ndebele and then Tonga. Can you say something about  Tonga people the history and why maybe also why it has just been introduced I mean I don't know  how long we've been teaching already Kiswahili but uh Kiswahili is it's just new although it's  a local language can you can you tell something about the story there was some some situation here  which only recognized two indigenous languages: Shona and Ndebele All the other languages indigenous languages  were not recognized as official, but then due to some advocacy and some some pressure from Tonga speaking people and other ethnic groups, there was a change in the constitution as  you are aware which now increased the number from 2 to I think 16. yeah, 14 15 16. yeah, they're  now 16 with them officially recognized languages, and Tonga is one of them now Tonga is a  cross-border language between Zambia and Zimbabwe the Tonga people are said to be um probably  among the first people to settle in the in the Zimbabwean land in the Zambezi Valley everyone who came says they found them there but there eventually became a split to have  the Zambian Tonga and the Zimbabwean Tonga when the Zambezi river was  impounded to construct the Kariba Dam before then what separated the two was  the Zambezi river and on either side of the other bank of the river you found these  related people who could cross over on a canoe or even shout across to the other so they visited  each other so often but around 1957 when the lake when the dam was completed there was now that  larger you know body of water which separated the two and the colonial system also imposed or  emphasized on the borders there was no more easy crossing from one side to the other and so these  people became separated but on the Zimbabwean side you find Tonga spoken all the way from Vic  Falls up to Chirundu along the Zambezi Valley and of course these people are said to have been  influenced quite a lot if not dominated quite a lot by the system as well as the the neighbouring  societies mostly then the Ndebele so you'll find a lot of Tonga speaking people using Ndebele names it's only in recent times that they began to reclaim their identity and with this  movement advocacy which saw Tonga introduced in schools in the education system many people have  now begun to go back to their longer identity the Tonga for quite a long time has been one would say a mysterious community one  they live in what others consider an inhabitable area the valley is extremely hot can be  very hot and then it's very mountainous so it's not easy to get down to where these people  are so very little was known about the Tonga and indeed the interaction with other societies  was also very very limited now when you refer to museums and like those yes to keep ancient  images historical you know images of the people and indeed uh like I should say many African  societies their innovation in terms of clothing was uh was was was slow so to say but you'd find  they were able to cure some animal skin they were able to to to make cloth from tree barks the  the fiber of a particular tree the Baobab tree because it usually gets very soft and it's  very strong and so those are the items they normally would wear but of course with the coming  of the traders the ivory traders the valley has a lot of elephant population and so people  were coming the Arabs especially are coming for both ivory and the slave raiding and these are the  people who together with the Portuguese i think they started bringing you know these articles  of cloth beads and several other things which have now become integrated into the uh  into the costume so to say of the Tonga people but in terms of stereotypes yes because  there's very little known there was very little known about them and you know when  there's not much known people create stories they'll come up with all this so what happened  was that marginalization now became so strong and that's why I did indicate earlier that  not many identified themselves as Tonga all because of the same stereotypes and  marginalization which they were viewed with so they didn't want to identify themselves  as such it's only in risk and times that they are loosening up and trying to  get back their pride as an ethnic group can you name some of the stereotypes that they were facing? Well one is that I heard of one which said they they had six six toes I heard that as  well I was very surprised to hear that yeah i heard I read it somewhere but uh although  someone recently in January 2019 this summer we took a tour of the valley from Hwange through  Binga to um to circle and even went down tomorrow we had someone who said he knows a place where a  particular group of people with six toes still live but whether that's true or not I don't know Can you maybe say how many percentage of  the people in Zimbabwe and Zambia are Tonga? just to have a relation I think maybe it's  about with five percent something like that yeah it could be a little more there's one  fellows Ncube there's a write-up I read somewhere which talks of a little more than five  percent in Zimbabwe but in Zambia we have about 17 about 17.6 out there younger speakers and the  people that are stereotyped on the Zambian side and the Valley Tonga the group that i belong  to again for the same reasons not many people would like to go and live with them to  know what they are yeah and with us they they attribute one particular aspect  that of being arrogant and perhaps very aggressive really yeah as a result of the the  tamarind the tamarind fruit you know the tamarind I think I know I've heard it but I've  never heard of it for sure while i was in Germany but I've got to know something new  new things to eat here yeah it's it's a fruit found only in the valley in Zambia I find it in  the Zambezi valley as well as the Luangwa valley and it's a very sour plant and that fruit has  been used in as a just an ordinary beverage but at times when we have famines when there's no  food there's scarcity of food it has played a very big role to sustain us and people think because  it's we are so used to this sour food our tempers can be on edge very short-circuited kind of  people you have to bring back one next time yeah I have some we have some here yes  oh we have to today we will try it I usually keep these uh traditional foods yeah  I come with these traditional foods yeah so those are some of the stereotypes you would find  and of course there's this famous smoking pipe called Incherwa you might have seen some some  old women smoking it's a god with a pipe and it's a nice innovation yes it's a nice innovation  they put their tobacco there. I like it like a like a ballish kind of structure, and when they  inhale, the smoke passes through the water and then back into the smoker's system. I've  seen a similar construction, yeah, and it's only the Valley Tonga who are associated with  that, and it's a very popular gadget especially among the elderly people now one  of the stereotypes associated with that is it's the people who smoke that actually do not  smoke or direct tobacco but it marijuana. I find that very crazy because marijuana  is associated with younger people, not the aged yeah yeah and not women  because men don't smoke that it's only the old women. Oh, that's  interesting why is it just the old women? Well, they find it more convenient because others  smoke it their tobacco is you know processed in a very interesting manner they they get the  green leaves smash them in a in a water and then what can I say they they they wrap it  with with banana covers banana leaves and and trap everything in there they  don't dry it in the in the hot in the oven they keep it in a cool place until it is hard and  it has dried so you can imagine all the nicotine and whatever other elements are trapped in  there, so the tobacco is very very strong yeah so to smoke it directly you need  to be a very strong person so the men and younger women who smoke smoke it directly  but for the old women they invented that pipe Investigating about the culture of the  people did you do some uh field research in addition to you growing up there in  certain areas like I don't know funeral reads I think I've heard your colleague talk about  that yeah yeah my main interest has been in the in two things one was the marriage marriage  practices of the stronger people the validity people and then the the funeral rights okay in  marriage I wanted to find out the various ways and realized or discovered that there were  actually several methods people would marry and some of them developed out of  the influence of westernization and the cash economy because  people we are required to pay taxes and to pay tax you you have to pay in money  monetary reform and you could only get that money from regular employment and the employer they are  the common employer then where the funds on the plateau in the on the Zambian side and the mines in  Zimbabwe especially Hwange and some came to do to work as far as Bulawayo others went as  far as Johannesburg and South Africa is it now the oldest practice or the favorite  practice in marriage was childhood betrothal where if your family is expecting and my family  already has a son who would approach your family if we are you know if we belong to clans that  marry each other we would approach your family and say in case it's a baby girl you you one of your  members is coming could that be our son's wife and if it turns out that when the baby is  born it's a girl that is the beginning of their relationship and these two that's an early  start to dating yeah yeah but they don't know that the two would not know except they'll be made  to you know they'll be the boy would be sent to run errands for the girl's family  so that he gets so used to that family and the girl also be seeing him so often  and think he's just one of the family you want me to tell you a folktale it depends  how long it is maybe a short piece of it maybe a very short one is that which  involves hey which is the shortest now ah okay, there's one one one factor of a  young man who was a very good hunter Muvimwi a hunter is going to move  in and was very proud of his skill but then this one time he went into the  bush to hunt and failed to catch any animal and so he didn't he wasn't too sure I was going  to be received back home if he went empty-handed, but as he was coming back, he came across one of  the sacred animals and decided to kill that one fine he killed it and put it on his shoulders and  walked home very happily at least with a kill but when he arrived in the village everyone just  looked at him no one was excited he was shocked what's wrong with these people I've brought  them a kill, and they don't seem to be excited, and so he went to where his the elderly men  were seated and he in anger he hanged up a tree and came to join them asked why no one  seemed to be interested in what he had killed, and they told him look that is not the kind of  animal we kill here that is a sacred animal you offended the ancestors now he wasn't amused with  that, and so he decided to leave the village, and he went away for a very long time now  we don't know how long very long time was, but when he came back after that  very long absence when he came back he found his animal the carcass still where  it was intact and still dripping with blood and the elderly man reminded him to say a  crime you commit or never rot or fade away yeah and there's a proverb to  that effect which says molandu tuboli molandu is a crime or  an offensive case if a wallet yes, meaning a case will never rot or decay now what that simply means is when a  crime or an affair has been committed, you should be bold enough to sit and discuss  it you don't walk away or run away and think people forget about that case, and so that story  was actually used to illustrate the proverb the meaning of sacred animals  you said now I know that in Zimbabwe and also in Zambia there is the  concept of totems yes so what is your totem? I am of the goat clan. Of the goat clan? Yes. I know  your colleague is from the elephant clan uh Khama yes yes yes this is from the  elephant clan and also the head of department yes it's also an elephant and my  my officemate is of the Leopard can you tell us a bit about that concept?  Yeah, as for us, the Tonga, we are matrilineal we shall claim to belong to the clan over our  mothers different like with the Shona. Yeah the Shona and the Ndebele are patrilineal they talk more of their paternal clans, okay,  so in my case my my brothers anyone who is of the goat clan is actually my brother and anyone  of the goat clan is my sister, so it could be brother nephew but not cousin because for us the  concept of cousin involves one born of my uncle which means my uncle is married to another  person another woman who is not of the same clan so I don't share the clan with my uncle's  children and those are the ones that call cousins but my mother's sister and her children yes my mother's  sister is my mother her children are my brothers and sisters yes because  you share the same plan yes I understand that's how it operates and wherever you go you  will people usually ask you what is your totem the whole idea is to link you to a family in  that area of the same totem so that you don't feel lost So this was the first episode  of Zim love my podcast about Zimbabwe, and I hope you already had a little of an insight  about Zimbabwe's rich culture history and also the great people because John is just such a wonderful  person and thank you in Tonga means tualumba", "sentences": ["My name is Roma and this is Zim  Love a podcast about a feeling that I try to describe through the stories and  anecdotes and perspectives of others wonderful people that I've met and through their stories I  want to change the thoughts and the feelings that people have when they think about this beautiful  place because once you put it into google all that pops up is expensive safaris or hyper inflation  or even different stories but there's a specific feeling to this place and I want to show you  through the eyes of others that after all everyone has been through and is going through  there is still a feeling that is true them love this interview was with John.", "John is my neighbor  that I met and we always greeting each other in Tonga so it will be about the Tonga people the  Tonga language and about John's own experiences  enjoy Tonga is a local language in Zimbabwe the  language that is spoken most is Shona then Ndebele and then Tonga.", "Can you say something about  Tonga people the

can you tell something about the story there was some some situation here  which only recognized two indigenous languages: Shona and Ndebele All the other languages indigenous languages  were not recognized as official, but then due to some advocacy and some some pressure from Tonga speaking people and other ethnic groups, there was a change in the constitution as  you are aware which now increased the number from 2 to I think 16.", "yeah, 14 15 16.", "yeah, they're  now 16 with them officially recognized languages, and Tonga is one of them now Tonga is a  cross-border language between Zambia and Zimbabwe the Tonga people are said to be um probably  among the first people to settle in the in the Zimbabwean land in the Zambezi Valley everyone who came says they found them there but there eventually became a split to have  the Zambian Tonga and the Zimbabwean Tonga when the Zambezi river was  impounded to construct the Kariba Dam before then what separated the two was  the Zambezi river and on either side of the other bank of the river you found these  related people who could cross over on a canoe or even shout across to the other so they visited  each other so often but around 1957 when the lake when the dam was completed there was now that  larger you know body of water which separated the two and the colonial system also imposed or  emphasized on the borders there was no more easy crossing from one side to the other and so these  people became separated but on the Zimbabwean side you find Tonga spoken all the way from Vic  Falls up to Chirundu along the Zambezi Valley and of course these people are said to have been  influenced quite a lot if not dominated quite a lot by the system as well as the the neighbouring  societies mostly then the Ndebele so you'll find a lot of Tonga speaking people using Ndebele names it's only in recent times that they began to reclaim their identity and with this  movement advocacy which saw Tonga introduced in schools in the education system many people have  now begun to go back to their longer identity the Tonga for quite a long time has been one would say a mysterious community one  they live in what others consider an inhabitable area the valley is extremely hot can be  very hot and then it's very mountainous so it's not easy to get down to where these people  are so very little was known about the Tonga and indeed the interaction with other societies  was also very very limited now when you refer to museums and like those yes to keep ancient  images historical you know images of the people and indeed uh like I should say many African  societies their innovation in terms of clothing was uh was was was slow so to say but you'd find  they were able to cure some animal skin they were able to to to make cloth from tree barks the  the fiber of a particular tree the Baobab tree because it usually gets very soft and it's  very strong and so those are the items they normally would wear but of course with the coming  of the traders the ivory traders the valley has a lot of elephant population and so people  were coming the Arabs especially are coming for both ivory and the slave raiding and these are the  people who together with the Portuguese i think they started bringing you know these articles  of cloth beads and several other things which have now become integrated into the uh  into the costume so to say of the Tonga people but in terms of stereotypes yes because  there's very little known there was very little known about them and you know when  there's not much known people create stories they'll come up with all this so what happened  was that marginalization now became so strong and that's why I did indicate earlier that  not many identified themselves as Tonga all because of the same stereotypes and  marginalization which they were viewed with so they didn't want to identify themselves  as such it's only in risk and times that they are loosening up and trying to  get back their pride as an ethnic group can you name some of the stereotypes that they were facing?", "Well one is that I heard of one which said they they had six six toes I heard that as  well I was very surprised to hear that yeah i heard I read it somewhere but uh although  someone recently in January 2019 this summer we took a tour of the valley from Hwange through  Binga to um to circle and even went down tomorrow we had someone who said he knows a place where a  particular group of people with six toes still live but whether that's true or not I don't know Can you maybe say how many percentage of  the people in Zimbabwe and Zambia are Tonga?", "just to have a relation I think maybe it's  about with five percent something like that yeah it could be a little more there's one  fellows Ncube there's a write-up I read somewhere which talks of a little more than five  percent in Zimbabwe but in Zambia we have about 17 about 17.6 out there younger speakers and the  people that are stereotyped on the Zambian side and the Valley Tonga the group that i belong  to again for the same reasons not many people would like to go and live with them to  know what they are yeah and with us they they attribute one particular aspect  that of being arrogant and perhaps very aggressive really yeah as a result of the the  tamarind the tamarind fruit you know the tamarind I think I know I've heard it but I've  never heard of it for sure while i was in Germany but I've got to know something new  new things to eat here yeah it's it's a fruit found only in the valley in Zambia I find it in  the Zambezi valley as well as the Luangwa valley and it's a very sour plant and that fruit has  been used in as a just an ordinary beverage but at times when we have famines when there's no  food there's scarcity of food it has played a very big role to sustain us and people think because  it's we are so used to this sour food our tempers can be on edge very short-circuited kind of  people you have to bring back one next time yeah I have some we have some here yes  oh we have to today we will try it I usually keep these uh traditional foods yeah  I come with these traditional foods yeah so those are some of the stereotypes you would find  and of course there's this famous smoking pipe called Incherwa you might have seen some some  old women smoking it's a god with a pipe and it's a nice innovation yes it's a nice innovation  they put their tobacco there.", "I like it like a like a ballish kind of structure, and when they  inhale, the smoke passes through the water and

has dried so you can imagine all the nicotine and whatever other elements are trapped in  there, so the tobacco is very very strong yeah so to smoke it directly you need  to be a very strong person so the men and younger women who smoke smoke it directly  but for the old women they invented that pipe Investigating about the culture of the  people did you do some uh field research in addition to you growing up there in  certain areas like I don't know funeral reads I think I've heard your colleague talk about  that yeah yeah my main interest has been in the in two things one was the marriage marriage  practices of the stronger people the validity people and then the the funeral rights okay in  marriage I wanted to find out the various ways and realized or discovered that there were  actually several methods people would marry and some of them developed out of  the influence of westernization and the cash economy because  people we are required to pay taxes and to pay tax you you have to pay in money  monetary reform and you could only get that money from regular employment and the employer they are  the common employer then where the funds on the plateau in the on the Zambian side and the mines in  Zimbabwe especially Hwange and some came to do to work as far as Bulawayo others went as  far as Johannesburg and South Africa is it now the oldest practice or the favorite  practice in marriage was childhood betrothal where if your family is expecting and my family  already has a son who would approach your family if we are you know if we belong to clans that  marry each other we would approach your family and say in case it's a baby girl you you one of your  members is coming could that be our son's wife and if it turns out that when the baby is  born it's a girl that is the beginning of their relationship and these two that's an early  start to dating yeah yeah but they don't know that the two would not know except they'll be made  to you know they'll be the boy would be sent to run errands for the girl's family  so that he gets so used to that family and the girl also be seeing him so often  and think he's just one of the family you want me to tell you a folktale it depends  how long it is maybe a short piece of it maybe a very short one is that which  involves hey which is the shortest now ah okay, there's one one one factor of a  young man who was a very good hunter Muvimwi a hunter is going to move  in and was very proud of his skill but then this one time he went into the  bush to hunt and failed to catch any animal and so he didn't he wasn't too sure I was going  to be received back home if he went empty-handed, but as he was coming back, he came across one of  the sacred animals and decided to kill that one fine he killed it and put it on his shoulders and  walked home very happily at least with a kill but when he arrived in the village everyone just  looked at him no one was excited he was shocked what's wrong with these people I've brought  them a kill, and they don't seem to be excited, and so he went to where his the elderly men  were seated and he in anger he hanged up a tree and came to join them asked why no one  seemed to be interested in what he had killed, and they told him look that is not the kind of  animal we kill here that is a sacred animal you offended the ancestors now he wasn't amused with  that, and so he decided to leave the village, and he went away for a very long time now  we don't know how long very long time was, but when he came back after that  very long absence when he came back he found his animal the carcass still where  it was intact and still dripping with blood and the elderly man reminded him to say a  crime you commit or never rot or fade away yeah and there's a proverb to  that effect which says molandu tuboli molandu is a crime or  an offensive case if a wallet yes, meaning a case will never rot or decay now what that simply means is when a  crime or an affair has been committed, you should be bold enough to sit and discuss  it you don't walk away or run away and think people forget about that case, and so that story  was actually used to illustrate the proverb the meaning of sacred animals  you said now I know that in Zimbabwe and also in Zambia there is the  concept of totems yes so what is your totem?", "I am of the goat clan.", "Of the goat clan?", "Yes.", "I know  your colleague is from the elephant clan uh Khama yes yes yes this is from the  elephant clan and also the head of department yes it's also an elephant and my  my officemate is of the Leopard can you tell us a bit about that concept?", "Yeah, as for us, the Tonga, we are matrilineal we shall claim to belong to the clan over our  mothers different like with the Shona.", "Yeah the Shona and the Ndebele are patrilineal they talk more of their paternal clans, okay,  so in my case my my brothers anyone who is of the goat clan is actually my brother and anyone  of the goat clan is my sister, so it could be brother nephew but not cousin because for us the  concept of cousin involves one born of my uncle which means my uncle is married to another  person another woman who is not of the same clan so I don't share the clan with my uncle's  children and those are the ones that call cousins but my mother's sister and her children yes my mother's  sister is my mother her children are my brothers and sisters yes because  you share the same plan yes I understand that's how it operates and wherever you go you  will people usually ask you what is your totem the whole idea is to link you to a family in  that area of the same totem so that you don't feel lost So this was the first episode  of Zim love my podcast about Zimbabwe, and I hope you already had a little of an insight
