Cheers! Bucharest isn't just the capital of Romania. It's a city that offers so much. Known for its grand architecture and creative energy, it's also the place  that shaped who I am and where I'm heading. I'm Maria. I'm 18 years old and in my last year  of high school here in Bucharest. Today I will show you my  version of this beautiful city. Bună dimineaţa. Good morning. Come on in. This is my house, and I was just  in the middle of making breakfast. Come meet my mom. Hi, welcome. We are preparing fried eggs for me, my mom and my father because my  brother doesn't want to eat with us. Hello. I live with my parents and my little brother here. We've lived here for as long as I can remember. Of course, I would love to  have my own place one day, but most young people in Romania don't  move out until they're around 28 years old. Perfect! Now I'm going to go to my room. Come with me. So, this is my room, my safe space. Honestly, I spend the most time here. When I'm at home, my favorite place in the world  is either my bed because I like to sleep a lot. And I have a lot of plushies to keep me company. My bookcase, it's my pride and joy. I have both books in English and Romanian, and I have one book in French. I very much like sci-fi books and fantasy books, and one of them is about  superheroes fighting on earth, not in space. We live in the suburbs, about  20 minutes from the city center. It's quieter here, which I like very much,  but I spend a lot of time in the city, especially on weekends and  when I have to go to school. And I'm ready to head out. Almost every morning my parents  drive me to the subway station. I could take the bus, but it  takes too long because the buses don't come that often in my area. Seeing that it is outside of Bucharest. In Romania, once you turn 18, you  can apply for the driver's license. I want to have that opportunity to be more  independent and drive myself around so that I do not have to wait for my  parents or deal with the bus. Thankfully though, public transportation is  nearly free for students, which is amazing, especially with how much I use it. We are at Terasa Obor, the best  place to eat mici in Bucharest, and we are very lucky because today  the queue is actually very small. Usually, me and my father wait around an hour  in line to get some meat for me and my family. Romanian is a really interesting language.  It's closely related to Italian and Spanish and actually is the only Romance language  to have developed in this part of Europe. One mic is five Lei which is around one euro,  and we usually eat them with mustard and bread. Noroc! That means cheers in Romanian. Some other Romanian  phrases you should know are of course, hello, which is Buna or Buna ziua. Bye bye. La revedere. Or just ... Pa Pa! And also, because Romanian culture is very  big on food that you should learn how to say bon appetit which is Poftă bună. In Romanian superstition it's said that  if something happens on a rainy day, for example I was born on a rainy day,  that the rain would bring fortune and luck into the person's life or situation. So, fingers crossed this is a lucky day. This is Mihai National College. It is my fourth and last year studying here. Sadly, we cannot get into the high school because  we were supposed to have elections this weekend. Romania's history makes elections feel important. The Romanian revolution of 1989 led to the overthrow of the communist regime. And even though that happened before I was born, the history and its significance  is still very much felt today. I was not very curious about politics before,  but this year, because I had the power to express my opinion and because when I was  little, I saw my parents doing that, they took us when they voted every time. I was very intrigued and I'm very excited to start my learning experience with  politics in Romania and abroad, of course. Usually, we have theater  rehearsals here every Saturday. But because the high school is  closed due to the elections, we are going to go to a local  theater and rehearse. Come along. I'd love to study theater in the university. It's something I'm really passionate about and I've made a lot of friends here. I'd like to stay here in Bucharest for my theater studies. I think it's a great city to be creative in. Though many of my friends plan to study  outside of the city and even go abroad. In fact, about half of young people between the  ages of 14 and 29 say they plan to leave Romania. I've known Maria for a couple of years. We met through theater. Film has always been my my passion. I would imagine myself working abroad. London  or New York, they offer a broader film industry. Oh my gosh, it's still raining. OK, now we're heading to one of my favorite spots in Bucharest. It is a Gelato shop. This is Vanessa. Hi. And this is Maria. Hi. As Romanians usually eat anything, everything, whenever we want, it's not unusual  for us to eat ice cream in winter. Romania has been an EU member since 2007,  and in 2025 it will be part of Schengen, which makes it pretty easy to move through Europe. I love Europe and I think it's such  a unique thing to travel throughout Europe because we have our own cultures. Depending on the country you are travelling. I've traveled a lot with my family in Europe. I wish to see after high school, I wish to see more of my own country because I  feel that I haven't traveled enough, but I've been to other places and  not every city feels like home. This city feels like home to me. Like I know places. I know nooks and crannies. I know the streets, I know the people. Remember what I taught you earlier?  To say goodbye in Romanian?
