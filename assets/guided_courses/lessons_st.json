section on the previous upload where I section on the previous upload where I section on the previous upload where I was doing a lesson someone asked for was doing a lesson someone asked for was doing a lesson someone asked for sentence structure I didn't know how to sentence structure I didn't know how to sentence structure I didn't know how to go about doing that so what I have go about doing that so what I have go about doing that so what I have decided to do is Google sentence decided to do is Google sentence decided to do is Google sentence structure and then just interpret I'll structure and then just interpret I'll structure and then just interpret I'll just start from page one I've got like just start from page one I've got like just start from page one I've got like three pages where I just wrote the three pages where I just wrote the three pages where I just wrote the English part I should have just gotten English part I should have just gotten English part I should have just gotten my laptop out read the English part and my laptop out read the English part and my laptop out read the English part and I should have written down the cisu part I should have written
