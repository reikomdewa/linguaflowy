interact say intra say interact hey same track Sentra intra say interact hey same track Sentra intra say interact hey same track Sentra say this say is interested so if you put say this say is interested so if you put say this say is interested so if you put say before anything you are saying say before anything you are saying say before anything you are saying whatever comes after the say s or was whatever comes after the say s or was whatever comes after the say s or was the case but you didn't know before so the case but you didn't know before so the case but you didn't know before so it's like saying in English not knowing it's like saying in English not knowing it's like saying in English not knowing it is something like that so for example it is something like that so for example it is something like that so for example if I am expecting say well qu and if I am expecting say well qu and if I am expecting say well qu and somebody knocks and I go to open somebody knocks

Nigerian alright so that is say and then Nigerian alright so that is say and then we have interact or in T so in T is the we have interact or in T so in T is the we have interact or in T so in T is the short form and then we have interest as short form and then we have interest as short form and then we have interest as a long form a long form a long form and if you put intra or inti after a and if you put intra or inti after a and if you put intra or inti after a word or a group of words you are saying word or a group of words you are saying word or a group of words you are saying because of the reference of the word because of the reference of the word because of the reference of the word that came before or the group of words that came before or the group of words that came before or the group of words that came before all right so if you say that came before all right so if you say that came before all right so if you say for example who fit in T you are saying for example who fit in T you are saying for example who fit in T you are saying because of coffee okay as you say a because of coffee okay as you say a because of coffee okay as you say a mantra you are saying because of Emma mantra you are saying because of Emma mantra you are saying because of Emma okay so whatever word or group of words okay so whatever word or group of words okay so whatever word or group of words that you put before intra or in C you that you put before intra or in C you that you put before intra or in C you are saying because of the reference or are saying because of the reference or are saying because of the reference or reference of that word or group of words reference of that word or group of words reference of that word or group of words so in our case we have to say intra so so in our case we have to say intra so so in our case we have to say intra so it's like you suddenly got to know about it's like you suddenly got to know about it's like you suddenly got to know about something that you didn't know before something that you didn't know before something that you didn't know before and that explains it okay it explains or and that explains it okay it explains or and that explains it okay it explains or it is because of that that something it is because of that that something it is because of that that something else had been the way it was okay so for else had been the way it was okay so for else had been the way it was okay so for example a position that you held before example a position that you held before example a position that you held before this what you just got to know about this what you just got to know about this what you just got to know about explains that so we have Sandra Sandra explains that so we have Sandra Sandra

mommy Seema Associa mommy Seema Seema mommy Seema Associa mommy Seema Kwami mommy Seema add your mommy Seema Kwami mommy Seema add your mommy Seema Kwami mommy Seema add your mommy Seema all right so we have math which as a two all right so we have math which as a two all right so we have math which as a two letter word you should know that it letter word you should know that it letter word you should know that it comes with several V means but within comes with several V means but within comes with several V means but within this context mat means to give there to this context mat means to give there to this context mat means to give there to give and then we have the object pronoun give and then we have the object pronoun give and then we have the object pronoun make me alright and then we have Seema make me alright and then we have Seema make me alright and then we have Seema which is a minute which is a minute which is a minute so mommy Seema means give me a minute so mommy Seema means give me a minute so mommy Seema means give me a minute so in English you tend to use give me a so in English you tend to use give me a so in English you tend to use give me a second but we use mommy Seema gave me a second but we use mommy Seema gave me a second but we use mommy Seema gave me a minute minute minute people spend a minute or more anyway people spend a minute or more anyway people spend a minute or more anyway when they ask for a second when they ask for a second when they ask for a second so we use mommy Seema give me a minute so we use mommy Seema give me a minute so we use mommy Seema give me a minute mommy Seema mommy Seema and finally we mommy Seema mommy Seema and finally we mommy Seema mommy Seema and finally we have wood deep bro woody bro have wood deep bro
