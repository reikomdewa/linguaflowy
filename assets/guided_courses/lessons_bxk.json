Luna I'm going to do. Luna I'm going to do. Luna Lun is today we are going to study. Lun is today we are going to study. Lun is today we are going to study. So study it can be can be to read like So study it can be can be to read like So study it can be can be to read like to read. I'm reading something which can to read. I'm reading something which can to read. I'm reading something which can be studying like I'm going to school to be studying like I'm going to school to be studying like I'm going to school to study you know um so the two ways study you know um so the two ways study you know um so the two ways studying and reading you can still use studying and reading you can still use studying and reading you can still use the same word the same word the same word and when you're going what do you need to have when you're what do you need to have when you're what do you need to have when you're going to study okay that's a question going to study okay that's a question going to study okay that's a question I've just asked you I've just asked you I've just asked you what are you supposed to have when what are you supposed to have when what are you supposed to have when you're going to study the first thing you're going to study the first thing you're going to study the first thing The first thing The first thing The first thing is the first thing you're supposed to have the first thing you're supposed to have the first thing you're supposed to have a book. a book. a book. A book. I'll be writing for you. Check A book. I'll be writing for you. Check A book. I'll be writing for you. Check the subtitles that you can see how to the subtitles that you can see how to the subtitles that you can see how to write it because the pronunciation is a write it because the pronunciation is a write it because the pronunciation is a little bit different from the way you little bit different from the way you little bit different from the way you write it. But the first thing you need write it. But the first thing you need write it. But the first thing you need of course is a book. Whether it's a book of course is a book. Whether it's a book of course is a book. Whether it's a book to write, to write, to write, a book for writing, a book for writing, a book for writing, another thing you need to write is when when when you're supposed to have you're supposed to have you're supposed to have actually also Now, you need to have a pen and a book.

So notice that I'm trying to give you So notice that I'm trying to give you So notice that I'm trying to give you English and because I'd like you to English and because I'd like you to English and because I'd like you to relate it and it will be easier for you relate it and it will be easier for you relate it and it will be easier for you to learn because most likely you already to learn because most likely you already to learn because most likely you already know Swahili if you're coming from know Swahili if you're coming from know Swahili if you're coming from Kenya. So you can be able to kind of Kenya. So you can be able to kind of Kenya. So you can be able to kind of relate this and then you know figure out relate this and then you know figure out relate this and then you know figure out how to to to make them to bring them to how to to to make them to bring them to how to to to make them to bring them to the lua or to bring them to the Bukusu the lua or to bring them to the Bukusu the lua or to bring them to the Bukusu version of it all. Okay. So, so far version of it all. Okay. So, so far version of it all. Okay. So, so far we've learned about we've learned about we've learned about a book a book a book a paper a paper a paper a pen. Okay. So, when you are studying, a pen. Okay. So, when you are studying, a pen. Okay. So, when you are studying, we don't only just write. Sometimes we we don't only just write. Sometimes we we don't only just write. Sometimes we read. Okay. Sometimes we read and you read. Okay. Sometimes we read and you read. Okay. Sometimes we read and you can be reading a text book. So, when you can be reading a text book.

Or you can say you know I'm going to study English is you know I'm going to study English is you know I'm going to study English is English is mathematics. Okay. So I think we now is mathematics. Okay. So I think we now is mathematics. Okay. So I think we now have some of the basic vocabul you can have some of the basic vocabul you can have some of the basic vocabul you can use to construct a sentence. But then use to construct a sentence. But then use to construct a sentence. But then where do you usually go to study? You where do you usually go to study? You where do you usually go to study? You know, do you go to study in a lake? Do know, do you go to study in a lake? Do know, do you go to study in a lake? Do you go to study in a field? Or do you go you go to study in a field? Or do you go you go to study in a field? Or do you go to study in a school? Definitely you go to study in a school? Definitely you go to study in a school? Definitely you go to study in a school. to study in a school. to study in a school. A school is a school. So you can say I will go to school. I will go to school. I will go to school. Tomorrow I will go to school. So it's Tomorrow I will go to school. So it's Tomorrow I will go to school. So it's good to know tomorrow, today, yesterday, good to know tomorrow, today, yesterday, good to know tomorrow, today, yesterday, you know that vocabulary in because it you know that vocabulary in because it you know that vocabulary in because it can help you to come up with a sentence can help you to come up with a sentence can help you to come up with a sentence or talk about whether it's school or any or talk about whether it's school or any or talk about whether it's school or any other thing you're trying to talk about. other thing you're trying to talk about. other thing you're trying to talk about. You can use such vocabulary to bring You can use such vocabulary to bring You can use such vocabulary to bring your sentences together. A teacher, your sentences together. A teacher, your sentences together. A teacher, another vocabulary is a teacher. another vocabulary is a teacher. another vocabulary is a teacher. If you know again, If you know again, If you know again, so the pronunciation is what is so the pronunciation is what is so the pronunciation is what is different. different. different. My teacher My teacher My teacher many teachers many teachers many teachers these teachers are many. Okay. So, so this is just singular plural. so this is just singular plural. so this is just singular plural. Singular plural. Now that we know Singular plural. Now that we know Singular plural. Now that we know teachers, let's talk about the students. teachers, let's talk about the students. teachers, let's talk about the students. Osi is a student, a pupil, someone who Osi is a student, a pupil, someone who Osi is a student, a pupil, someone who is studying something is studying something is studying something and in plural it's and in plural it's and in plural it's okay. okay. okay. So So So this students or these people who are this students or these people who are this students or these people who are studying there are very many students or studying there are very many students or studying there are very many students or pupils there are many you know it means pupils there are many you know it means pupils there are many you know it means many or a lot. So like I said I'm taking many or a lot. So like I said I'm taking many or a lot. So like I said I'm taking you with me as I study. Of course, it you with me as I study. Of course, it you with me as I study. Of course, it will be boring if you just watch me, you will be boring if you just watch me, you will be boring if you just watch me, you know, studying and not doing anything. know, studying and not doing anything. know, studying and not doing anything.
