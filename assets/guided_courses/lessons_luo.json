"let's go Hello, My name is Niquee Agina and welcome back to the Luo English Dictionary channel. Today I am going to be the student and my Dad is going to be the teacher Good thank you. My name is Agina  and the intent of this channel is to teach your kids or your spouse or anyone that you know that understands Luo and you don't understand Luo, the intent is that you learn together so this morning or this evening wherever you are you'd like to learn a few words and we want to do this as a challenge we want to do a 52-week challenge whereby every week we shall post out a video and then we expect you or someone else to learn through the video and practice remember in language learning you must practice every day so you can hear what we say and then you practice so today we are going to learn about two things Greetings and Counting so we shall do Greetings first and then move on to counting in Luo greetings is divided into four parts morning greetings day time greetings evening greetings and night greetings that is the good night part so I'll start with the morning in the morning you say when you wake up you say OYAORE what do you say OYAORE again OYAORE  when you say OYAORE I'll say BER AHINYA what do I say BER AHINYA so I'll say I'll give you the greeting and then you have to give it back alright,  OYAORE , BER AHINYA  your turn OYAORE, BER AHINYA during the day you can say IRIYO NADE what you say IRIYO NADE and then i'll say ARIYO MABER, ARIYO MABER what ARIYO MABER. IRIYO NADE? ARIYO MABER IRIYO NADE? ARIYO MABER. Alright in the evening with the Sun is setting you say OIMORE what OIMORE  OIMORE when I say OIMORE you say OIMORE AHINYA OIMORE, OIMORE AHINYA your turn OIMORE OIMORE AHINYA. OIMORE! thank you. At night when you're going to sleep at night to say good night you say ININD MABER you say ININD MABER. ININD MABER what ININD MABER so that just yeah that's like saying good night and when I say ININD MABER she also says ININD MABER good night good night ININD MABER, ININD MABER alright so these are the four greetings OYAORE, OYAORE AHINYA IRIYO NADE, ARIYO MABER. OIMORE, OIMORE AHINYA ININD MABER, ININD MABER do you get it ? OYAORE IRYO NADE? OIMORE? ININD MABER ININD MABER those are the four greetings simple right okay second thing is we want to count so you want to count from one to ten and the good thing is our counting is all the letters begin with an A apart from nine so I just wrote them down for her so you tell me the letter and the word in the number in English and I'll give you the number in the Luo and then after that you come together and then you count by yourself all right so lets start ONE - ACHIEL TWO - ARIYO THREE - ADEK  FOUR - ANG'WEN FIVE - ABICH, SIX - AUCHIEL SEVEN - ABIRIYO EIGHT - ABORO NINE - OCHIKO TEN - APAR so let's count together  Achiel, Ariyo, Adek, Ang'wen, Abich Auchiel, Abiriyo Aboro, Ochiko Apar. count by yourself Achiel Ariyo Adek  Ang'wen Abich Auchiel Abiriyo Aboro Ochiko Apar that's how you count now we've done a video earlier on counting and actually done counting 1 through 100 so you can look through our channel and see whether that makes sense you can leave comments suggestions how to improve this remember we're just doing this for fun and we want to learn our language and be proud of it all right you have anything to say now Yes I do. I would also like you to comment down below if you practice along with us and you also practice this every day. there's one more thing. I was doing some research and I saw that the Luo language is shared with the Anuak tribe of Ethiopia in the Lou of South Sudan and I noticed that even though we have similar intonation and how we pronounce things but here they are wanting might be off so if you feel that this is not the Luo that you know then probably you you among the people of the Anuak of the Ethiopian people or the South Sudanese all the Ugandan there is a Luo language the Acholi people that I think they speak some bit of Luo which is that's their own but I mean this is universal we can debate this, we can talk about this and good thing is you can comment down below and let's see you next week okay see you bye bye", "sentences": ["let's go Hello, My name is Niquee Agina and welcome back to the Luo English Dictionary channel.", "Today I am going to be the student and my Dad is going to be the teacher Good thank you.", "My name is Agina  and the intent of this channel is to teach your kids or your spouse or anyone that you know that understands Luo and you don't understand Luo, the intent is that you learn together so this morning or this evening wherever you are you'd like to learn a few words and we want to do this as a challenge we want to do a 52-week challenge whereby every week we shall post out a video and then we expect you or someone else to learn through the video and practice remember in language learning you must practice every day so you can hear what we say and then you practice so today we are going to learn about two things Greetings and Counting so we shall do Greetings first and then move on to counting in Luo greetings is divided into four parts morning greetings day time greetings evening greetings and night greetings that is the good night part so I'll start with the morning in the morning you say when you wake up you say OYAORE what do you say OYAORE again OYAORE  when you say OYAORE I'll say BER AHINYA what do I say BER AHINYA so I'll say I'll give you the greeting and then you have to give it back alright,  OYAORE , BER AHINYA  your turn OYAORE, BER AHINYA during the day you can say IRIYO NADE what you say IRIYO NADE and then i'll say ARIYO MABER, ARIYO MABER what ARIYO MABER.", "IRIYO NADE?", "ARIYO MABER IRIYO NADE?", "ARIYO MABER.", "Alright in the evening with the Sun is setting you say OIMORE what OIMORE  OIMORE when I say OIMORE you say OIMORE AHINYA OIMORE, OIMORE AHINYA your turn OIMORE OIMORE AHINYA.", "OIMORE!", "thank you.", "At night when you're going to sleep at night to say good night you say ININD MABER you say ININD MABER.", "ININD MABER what ININD MABER so that just yeah that's like saying good night and when I say ININD MABER she also says ININD MABER good night good night ININD MABER, ININD MABER alright so these are the four greetings OYAORE, OYAORE AHINYA IRIYO NADE, ARIYO MABER.", "OIMORE, OIMORE AHINYA ININD MABER, ININD MABER do you get it ?", "OYAORE IRYO NADE?", "OIMORE?", "ININD MABER ININD MABER those are the four greetings simple right okay second thing is we want to count so you want to count from one to ten and the good thing is our counting is all the letters begin with an A apart from nine so I just wrote them down for her so you tell me the letter and the word in the number in English and I'll give you the number in the Luo and then after that you come together and then you count by yourself all right so lets start ONE -
