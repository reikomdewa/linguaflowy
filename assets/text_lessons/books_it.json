The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci\r\n\r\nVolume 1\r\n\r\nTranslated by Jean Paul Richter\r\n\r\n1888\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE. A singular fatality has ruled the destiny of nearly all the most\r\nfamous of Leonardo da Vinci's works. Two of the three most important\r\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\r\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\r\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\r\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\r\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\r\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\r\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\r\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description. Vasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, \"that he laboured\r\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed\", and the biographer\r\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\r\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\r\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\r\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\r\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\r\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\r\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\r\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\r\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript. That, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\r\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\r\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them. The handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\r\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\r\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\r\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\r\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: \"he wrote backwards,\r\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\r\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them\". The aid of a\r\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\r\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\r\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\r\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\r\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo's handwriting runs\r\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\r\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\r\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\r\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\r\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\r\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\r\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\r\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\r\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\r\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\r\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\r\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\r\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\r\nhave failed. Leonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\r\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\r\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\r\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\r\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\r\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\r\nthem.", "sentences": ["This eBook was produced by Charles Aldarondo and the Distributed\r\nProofreaders team.", "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci\r\n\r\nVolume 1\r\n\r\nTranslated by Jean Paul Richter\r\n\r\n1888\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.", "A singular fatality has ruled the destiny of nearly all the most\r\nfamous of Leonardo da Vinci's works.", "Two of the three most important\r\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\r\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\r\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\r\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\r\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\r\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\r\ncenturies.", "Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\r\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.", "Vasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, \"that he laboured\r\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed\", and the biographer\r\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\r\nhave been preserved to this day.", "To us, now, it seems almost\r\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\r\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten.", "It\r\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\r\nexceptional value was highly appreciated.", "This is proved not merely\r\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\r\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\r\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.", "That, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\r\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\r\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.", "The handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\r\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\r\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\r\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole.", "Vasari\r\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: \"he wrote backwards,\r\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\r\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them\".", "The aid of a\r\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\r\nfor a first experimental reading.", "Speaking from my own experience,\r\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\r\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\r\nto be deciphered.", "And as, after all, Leonardo's handwriting runs\r\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\r\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\r\nwriting is not insuperable.", "This obvious peculiarity in the writing\r\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\r\nmastering the text.", "Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\r\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\r\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\r\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\r\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\r\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\r\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\r\ndesperate one to a beginner.", "It is therefore not surprising that the\r\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\r\nhave failed.", "Leonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\r\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\r\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\r\nand dissertations.", "The vast structure of his scientific theories is\r\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\r\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\r\nthem."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_2", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 2)", "language": "it", "content": "His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\r\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\r\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\r\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\r\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\r\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\r\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\r\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\r\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\r\nof poetry to painting; and so forth. Leonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\r\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\r\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\r\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\r\ncould not have done it. Added to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\r\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\r\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\r\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\r\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\r\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\r\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\r\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\r\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\r\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\r\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\r\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\r\nnumbered pages, the written observations: \"turn over\", \"This is the\r\ncontinuation of the previous page\", and the like. Is not this\r\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\r\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\r\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\r\nwritings? What this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\r\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\r\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\r\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\r\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\r\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\r\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\r\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\r\nexecution of this responsible task. The beginning of Leonardo's literary labours dates from about his\r\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\r\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\r\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\r\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\r\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\r\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\r\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\r\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\r\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\r\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\r\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\r\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\r\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\r\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\r\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\r\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\r\nliterary works now extant.", "sentences": ["His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\r\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\r\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\r\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\r\nwithout any connection.", "A page, for instance, will begin with some\r\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\r\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour.", "Another page\r\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\r\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\r\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.", "Leonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\r\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\r\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions.", "No\r\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\r\ncould not have done it.", "Added to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\r\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\r\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\r\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\r\nmore or less extent.", "Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\r\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\r\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\r\nindifference to him.", "The only point he seems to have kept in view,\r\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\r\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun.", "The\r\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\r\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\r\nnumbered pages, the written observations: \"turn over\", \"This is the\r\ncontinuation of the previous page\", and the like.", "Is not this\r\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\r\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\r\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\r\nwritings?", "What this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\r\nindicated with considerable completeness.", "In other cases this\r\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\r\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\r\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\r\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\r\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\r\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\r\nexecution of this responsible task.", "The beginning of Leonardo's literary labours dates from about his\r\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\r\nany serious interruption till his death.", "Thus the Manuscripts that\r\nremain represent a period of about thirty years.", "Within this space\r\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\r\njudge from it of the date of any particular text.", "The exact dates,\r\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\r\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\r\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them.", "The assistance these\r\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\r\ngenerally self evident.", "By this clue I have assigned to the original\r\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\r\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\r\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\r\nobservations were made and registered.", "For this purpose the\r\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol.", "II, may be\r\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\r\nliterary works now extant."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_3", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 3)", "language": "it", "content": "The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\r\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\r\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\r\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\r\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\r\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\r\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\r\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\r\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\r\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\r\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\r\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\r\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\r\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\r\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\r\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\r\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\r\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\r\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\r\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes. In 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\r\nfrom Leonardo's writings on painting, and this treatise became so\r\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\r\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\r\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\r\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo's text had been more\r\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\r\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo's essays and precepts on\r\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\r\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\r\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\r\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\r\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\r\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\r\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\r\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\r\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\r\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\r\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\r\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\r\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\r\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\r\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\r\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\r\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\r\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\r\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\r\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\r\norder--or rather disorder. I, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\r\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\r\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\r\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\r\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\r\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\r\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\r\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\r\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato.", "sentences": ["The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\r\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\r\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\r\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\r\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\r\nis to be found.", "Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\r\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\r\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\r\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\r\nwhere it stood in the original document.", "Thus, too, by following the\r\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\r\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\r\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\r\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\r\nthis work.", "It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\r\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\r\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\r\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\r\nwith by specialists.", "I have given as complete a review of these\r\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.", "In 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\r\nfrom Leonardo's writings on painting, and this treatise became so\r\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\r\nand in six different languages.", "But none of these editions were\r\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\r\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo's text had been more\r\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary.", "The oldest and on\r\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo's essays and precepts on\r\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\r\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882.", "Still,\r\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\r\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\r\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\r\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\r\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\r\noriginal Manuscript extant.", "These copies, at any rate neither give\r\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\r\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\r\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\r\nsatisfactory reading.", "The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\r\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\r\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\r\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\r\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\r\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme.", "Under the\r\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\r\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\r\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\r\norder--or rather disorder.", "I, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\r\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\r\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\r\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\r\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\r\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place.", "Though this discovery was of a fragment\r\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\r\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\r\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_4", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 4)", "language": "it", "content": "The extensive\r\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\r\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\r\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\r\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\r\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\r\nthe process of \"photogravure\". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\r\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\r\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\r\nAdministrative de l'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\r\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\r\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\r\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\r\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\r\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\r\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\r\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\r\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo's; as also by the\r\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\r\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\r\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\r\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\r\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\r\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\r\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\r\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\r\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.

Morelli,\r\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\r\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\r\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\r\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\r\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\r\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\r\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\r\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets. The notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\r\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris. I may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\r\nnegatives for the production of the \"photo-gravures\" by Monsieur\r\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals. It is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\r\nreproduced in facsimile have never been published before. As I am\r\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years' duration, in a\r\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\r\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\r\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\r\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\r\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\r\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist.

Seeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\r\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\r\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\r\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\r\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\r\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\r\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\r\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\r\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\r\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\r\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this 'Proemio' a covert\r\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\r\nrivals and opponents more closely.

[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\r\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\r\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\r\nwriting of the two passages.]\r\n\r\n16. THE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING. Perspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\r\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\r\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\r\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\r\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\r\nthe objects at various distances. 17. ON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING. The first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\r\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\r\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\r\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\r\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\r\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour. And of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\r\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\r\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\r\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\r\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\r\nbrothers, &c. [Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\r\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\r\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\r\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\r\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\r\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\r\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\r\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\r\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\r\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\r\n\r\nThe use of the book on Painting. 18. These rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\r\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\r\nthem not, cannot amend them. But you, knowing your errors, will\r\ncorrect your works and where you find mistakes amend them, and\r\nremember never to fall into them again. But if you try to apply\r\nthese rules in composition you will never make an end, and will\r\nproduce confusion in your works. These rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment; since\r\ngood judgment is born of clear understanding, and a clear\r\nunderstanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules, and sound\r\nrules are the issue of sound experience--the common mother of all\r\nthe sciences and arts. Hence, bearing in mind the precepts of my\r\nrules, you will be able, merely by your amended judgment, to\r\ncriticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a\r\nwork, whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing\r\nelse.

Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the\r\nsailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never\r\ncan be certain whether he is going.

The function of the eye (21-23). 21. INTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE. Behold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our\r\nforefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and\r\nLife are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at\r\nany time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for\r\nmany ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we\r\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\r\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\r\nby experience, that it is quite another. [Footnote 13: Compare the\r\nnote to No. 70.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study\r\nof Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions\r\nof the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his\r\nastronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b '_Ordine del\r\nprovare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l'occhio'_,\r\n&c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical\r\nperspective.]\r\n\r\n22. Here [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every\r\npart of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is\r\nso marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by\r\nthy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of\r\nits cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;... In so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole\r\nexpanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between\r\nthe diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from\r\nthem of the crystalline lens. 23. OF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING. Painting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which\r\nare:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,\r\nDistance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine\r\nwill be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the\r\npainter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to\r\nimitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world. 24. ON PAINTING. Variability of the eye. 1st. The pupil of the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase\r\nof light which is reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands\r\nin proportion to the diminution in the day light, or any other\r\nlight, that is reflected in it. 3rd. [Footnote: 8. The subject of\r\nthis third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The\r\neye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater\r\nintensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and\r\nthis can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,\r\nand certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies\r\nin a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in\r\nthe light. 4th. The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\r\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\r\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\r\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\r\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\r\nhue. 25. OF THE EYE. Focus of sight. If the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\r\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\r\ntip of his nose.

The motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\r\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\r\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest. ON PAINTING. Objects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\r\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\r\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\r\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\r\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects. 29. Let the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\r\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\r\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\r\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\r\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\r\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\r\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\r\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\r\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\r\nsame conditions of light and shade? [Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\r\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\r\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\r\nto the spectator.]\r\n\r\n30. The comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\r\n(30-39). The eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\r\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\r\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\r\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\r\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\r\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\r\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image. 31. Every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\r\nand larger in the morning than at midday. This happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\r\nthan at any other time. 32. The pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\r\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\r\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\r\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\r\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\r\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\r\nwould exercise its function. [Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\r\n\r\n33. When the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\r\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\r\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\r\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\r\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\r\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\r\nit is farther from the eye. 34. Why when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\r\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\r\nhalf light look very bright? 35. ON PAINTING. If the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\r\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is. This happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\r\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\r\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\r\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\r\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.", "sentences": ["Objects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\r\nsometimes small.", "28.", "The motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\r\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\r\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.", "ON PAINTING.", "Objects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\r\nlook like a perfect picture.", "If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\r\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\r\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_.", "A\r\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.", "29.", "Let the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\r\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\r\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\r\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\r\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\r\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_.", "Why will not a picture\r\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\r\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\r\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\r\nsame conditions of light and shade?", "[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\r\nwhile the text reverses this lettering.", "We must therefore suppose\r\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\r\nto the spectator.]\r\n\r\n30.", "The comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\r\n(30-39).", "The eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\r\nbetter than that of a shaded object.", "The reason is that the eye is\r\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\r\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\r\nbe seen or recognised by the eye.", "Light is totally contrary and\r\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\r\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.", "31.", "Every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\r\nand larger in the morning than at midday.", "This happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\r\nthan at any other time.", "32.", "The pupil which is largest will see objects the largest.", "This is\r\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\r\nin the sky.", "When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\r\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\r\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\r\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\r\nwould exercise its function.", "[Footnote: 9.", "_buso_ in the Lomb.", "dialect is the same as _buco_.]\r\n\r\n33.", "When the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\r\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\r\nit.", "The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\r\nseen with two eyes than with only one.", "A luminous object will appear\r\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening.", "A\r\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\r\nit is farther from the eye.", "34.", "Why when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\r\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\r\nhalf light look very bright?", "35.", "ON PAINTING.", "If the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\r\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.", "This happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\r\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\r\nluminous.", "And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\r\nobjects appear that it sees.", "But as soon as the eye enters into a\r\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_15", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 15)", "language": "it", "content": "This occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\r\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\r\ndarkness seem less.

The eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\r\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark. And this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\r\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\r\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\r\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\r\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\r\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\r\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\r\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\r\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\r\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\r\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\r\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\r\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\r\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\r\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\r\neye, and from that I learnt it. 37. Experiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\r\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\r\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\r\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\r\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\r\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\r\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\r\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\r\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\r\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\r\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it. [Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\r\naccompanying diagram.]\r\n\r\n38. The pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\r\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\r\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\r\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\r\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\r\nmay look at. 39. The eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\r\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\r\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\r\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\r\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\r\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light. _II. Linear Perspective. We see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\r\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\r\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\r\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\r\nsection 50 the theory of the \"Pyramid of Sight\" is distinctly and\r\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\r\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\r\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\r\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\r\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\r\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point. Leon Battista Alberti treats of the \"Pyramid of Sight\" at some\r\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\r\nwidely from Leonardo's in the details.", "sentences": ["This occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\r\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\r\ndarkness seem less.", "[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_.", "_Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\r\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C.", "A.", "84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\r\nother places.]\r\n\r\n36.", "ON PERSPECTIVE.", "The eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\r\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.", "And this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\r\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\r\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\r\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\r\nare also deficient in [seeing] power.", "Though you might say to me: A\r\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\r\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black!", "To this\r\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\r\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\r\nof sight and to nothing else.", "Or--to return--this pupil in Man\r\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\r\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\r\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\r\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\r\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\r\neye, and from that I learnt it.", "37.", "Experiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\r\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries.", "In proportion as\r\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\r\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\r\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\r\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\r\nthe eye and the luminous body.", "Let the experiment be made, by\r\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\r\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\r\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\r\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.", "[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\r\naccompanying diagram.]\r\n\r\n38.", "The pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\r\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\r\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\r\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\r\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\r\nmay look at.", "39.", "The eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\r\nsome time.", "This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\r\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it.", "After\r\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\r\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\r\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.", "_II.", "Linear Perspective.", "We see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\r\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\r\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\r\nart of Painting.", "They are therefore here placed at the beginning.", "In\r\nsection 50 the theory of the \"Pyramid of Sight\" is distinctly and\r\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\r\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully.", "This theory of\r\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity.", "Such\r\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\r\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\r\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.", "Leon Battista Alberti treats of the \"Pyramid of Sight\" at some\r\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\r\nwidely from Leonardo's in the details."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_16", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 16)", "language": "it", "content": "Leonardo, like Alberti, may\r\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\r\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\r\napplication in a perfectly original manner. The axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\r\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\r\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\r\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\r\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\r\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\r\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist's point of\r\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility. According to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\r\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\r\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\r\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\r\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\r\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\r\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays \"just as a magnet\r\nattracts iron\". In connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\r\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\r\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\r\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\r\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\r\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82). _From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\r\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\r\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\r\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\r\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\r\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89). _Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\r\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\r\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109). General remarks on perspective (40-41). 40. ON PAINTING. Perspective is the best guide to the art of Painting. [Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\r\n\r\n41. The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\r\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat. The elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46). 42. All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\r\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\r\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\r\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\r\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space. The line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\r\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\r\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\r\nthe junction of two lines in a point. 43. A point is not part of a line. 44. OF THE NATURAL POINT.

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\r\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\r\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first. 48. OF DRAWING OUTLINE. Consider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\r\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\r\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\r\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities. 49. The nature of the outline. The boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\r\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\r\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\r\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\r\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\r\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\r\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\r\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\r\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\r\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\r\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance. 50. Definition of Perspective. [Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\r\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye.

IN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT. The perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye. Supposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\r\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\r\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\r\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\r\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\r\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\r\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\r\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_. And you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\r\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\r\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\r\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\r\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\r\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\r\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\r\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\r\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\r\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\r\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\r\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above. [Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\r\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\r\n\r\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55). 52. Perspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\r\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\r\nlines. By a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\r\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\r\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\r\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\r\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\r\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\r\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\r\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\r\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\r\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\r\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\r\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\r\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\r\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\r\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\r\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\r\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\r\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\r\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\r\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\r\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\r\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below. Let _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\r\nmentioned.", "sentences": ["By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\r\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\r\nmeet in a single point.", "A point is said to be that which [having no\r\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\r\nreceives all the points of the cone.", "[Footnote: 50.", "1-5.", "Compare with this the Proem.", "No.", "21.", "The\r\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\r\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\r\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\r\n\r\n51.", "IN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.", "The perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.", "Supposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\r\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\r\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\r\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\r\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\r\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light.", "And the pupil\r\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\r\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.", "And you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\r\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\r\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\r\nthe line _b c_.", "For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\r\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\r\ncoincide with the line _a b_.", "And the proof is this: If the eye,\r\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\r\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\r\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\r\nthe line _a c_.", "All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\r\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\r\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.", "[Footnote: 51.", "In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\r\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\r\n\r\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).", "52.", "Perspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\r\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\r\nlines.", "By a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\r\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\r\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\r\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\r\nobjects.", "By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\r\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\r\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\r\nthis point.", "This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\r\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid.", "And if\r\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\r\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\r\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\r\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\r\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\r\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\r\nseen in the diagram below.", "Let _a_.", "be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\r\nlines which reach the eye.", "Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\r\nthese lines.", "You plainly see that these will never diminish by\r\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\r\nit.", "Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\r\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\r\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.", "Let _a_.", "_b_.", "be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\r\nmentioned."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_19", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 19)", "language": "it", "content": "If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\r\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\r\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\r\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid. 53. PERSPECTIVE. Perspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\r\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\r\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\r\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\r\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\r\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\r\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\r\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\r\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\r\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\r\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\r\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\r\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\r\npainting. 54. TO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE. If you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\r\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time. This is evidence that images enter into the eye. The relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56). 55. ELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE. All objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\r\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\r\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\r\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_. Compare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\r\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\r\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\r\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\r\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\r\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\r\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\r\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement. Leonardo's mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\r\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\r\nin the plane _a n_. The eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\r\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\r\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\r\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\r\nobject you are looking at. And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\r\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\r\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\r\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\r\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\r\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\r\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\r\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\r\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\r\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\r\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\r\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\r\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\r\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\r\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane.", "sentences": ["If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\r\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\r\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\r\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.", "53.", "PERSPECTIVE.", "Perspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\r\nobjects which diminish.", "The eye can never be a true judge for\r\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\r\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\r\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\r\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective.", "Let\r\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned.", "Let _a b c\r\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other;

because objects placed upon the level on which\r\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\r\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\r\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\r\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye.

As regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\r\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\r\nown image.

And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\r\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\r\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\r\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\r\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\r\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\r\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\r\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\r\no_. Then [again] bring it closer to the eye and you will see the rod\r\nproject far beyond the image of the tower from _a_ to _b_ and from\r\n_t_ to _b_, and so you will discern that, a little farther within,\r\nthe lines must converge in a point.

These intersect and cross\r\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\r\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\r\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\r\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\r\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\r\nthe object that produces it. Proof by experiment (65-66). 65. PERSPECTIVE. The air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\r\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\r\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\r\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\r\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\r\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\r\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\r\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\r\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\r\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\r\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\r\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\r\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\r\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\r\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\r\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\r\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\r\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\r\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\r\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\r\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\r\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly. When one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\r\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\r\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\r\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\r\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\r\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\r\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\r\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\r\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\r\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\r\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\r\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\r\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\r\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\r\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\r\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\r\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\r\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\r\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\r\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part. 66. The images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\r\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\r\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\r\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\r\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\r\nplane as the number of the said holes. 67.

As is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other. 68. That the contrary is impossible. It is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\r\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\r\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\r\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\r\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\r\nmonth's time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\r\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\r\nremain in a continuous line from the eye to the sun and should\r\nalways diverge in such a way as to form between the sun and the eye\r\nthe base and the apex of a pyramid. This being the case, if the eye\r\nconsisted of a million worlds, it would not prevent its being\r\nconsumed in the projection of its virtue; and if this virtue would\r\nhave to travel through the air as perfumes do, the winds would bent\r\nit and carry it into another place. But we do [in fact] see the mass\r\nof the sun with the same rapidity as [an object] at the distance of\r\na braccio, and the power of sight is not disturbed by the blowing of\r\nthe winds nor by any other accident.

Therefore we may\r\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\r\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\r\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\r\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\r\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\r\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\r\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\r\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\r\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\r\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\r\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to\r\ncontain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images\r\nprojected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that\r\nit is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the\r\nobjects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a\r\nloadstone, being placed between them.

Hence the\r\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\r\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\r\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\r\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\r\nbodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays\r\nforming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will\r\nthe representations be on the wall. [Footnote: 70. 15--23.

This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\r\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\r\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\r\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\r\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect. [Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\r\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\r\n\r\n78. Necessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\r\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\r\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\r\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\r\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\r\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\r\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\r\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\r\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\r\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\r\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\r\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\r\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\r\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\r\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\r\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\r\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\r\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\r\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye. 79. OF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE. Only one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\r\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\r\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\r\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions. According to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\r\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\r\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\r\nbodies that surround it. 80. AS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\r\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING. It is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\r\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\r\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\r\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\r\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\r\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\r\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\r\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\r\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\r\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by\r\nthe movement of the line _a f_ to _a b_ and of the line _e b_ to _e\r\nf_, which are the sides of the surface _a f e b_. But if you move\r\nthe line _a b_ and the line _e f_, with the frontends _a e_, to the\r\nspot _c_, you will have moved the opposite ends _f b_ towards each\r\nother at the point _d_. And from the two lines you will have drawn\r\nthe straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of\r\nthese two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you\r\nimagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by\r\nthis motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal\r\nwith it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_.

But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\r\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\r\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance. Read the marginal text on the other side. In proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\r\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\r\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\r\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\r\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\r\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\r\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\r\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\r\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\r\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\r\nthan the object in shade.

But this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\r\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_. It is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\r\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\r\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\r\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly. When the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\r\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone.

Now, the first includes the [visible]\r\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\r\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\r\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\r\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\r\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\r\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\r\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\r\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first. 90. SIMPLE PERSPECTIVE. Simple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\r\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\r\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\r\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye. 91. PERSPECTIVE. No surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\r\nnot equally remote from all its edges. 92. WHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\r\nINDISTINCT. When an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\r\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\r\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\r\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\r\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\r\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\r\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\r\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\r\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\r\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\r\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\r\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\r\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\r\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\r\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\r\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\r\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\r\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up. Hence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\r\nconfused outlines. The relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\r\neye (93-98). 93. PERSPECTIVE. Small objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\r\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size. 94. PERSPECTIVE. There is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\r\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near. 95. Among objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\r\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\r\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\r\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108. The same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\r\n_Infra le cose d'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\r\nche sara più distante dall' ochio_.--]\r\n\r\n96. Why an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\r\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\r\nfar off [as the case may be]. 97. PERSPECTIVE. Among objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\r\nwill look the smallest. 98. PERSPECTIVE.

If you place the vertical plane at one braccio from the eye, the\r\nfirst object, being at a distance of 4 braccia from your eye will\r\ndiminish to 3/4 of its height at that plane; and if it is 8 braccia\r\nfrom the eye, to 7/8; and if it is 16 braccia off, it will diminish\r\nto 15/16 of its height and so on by degrees, as the space doubles\r\nthe diminution will double. 101. Begin from the line _m f_ with the eye below; then go up and do the\r\nsame with the line _n f_, then with the eye above and close to the 2\r\ngauges on the ground look at _m n_; then as _c m_ is to _m n_ so\r\nwill _n m_ be to _n s_. If _a n_ goes 3 times into _f b, m p_ will do the same into _p g_. Then go backwards so far as that _c d_ goes twice into _a n_ and _p\r\ng_ will be equal to _g h_. And _m p_ will go into _h p_ as often as\r\n_d c_ into _o p_. [Footnote: The first three lines are unfortunately very obscure.]\r\n\r\n102.

The differences in the diminution of objects of equal size in\r\nconsequence of their various remoteness from the eye will bear among\r\nthemselves the same proportions as those of the spaces between the\r\neye and the different objects.

The eye cannot judge where an object high up ought to descend. 106. PERSPECTIVE. If two similar and equal objects are placed one beyond the other at\r\na given distance the difference in their size will appear greater in\r\nproportion as they are nearer to the eye that sees them. And\r\nconversely there will seem to be less difference in their size in\r\nproportion as they are remote from the eve. This is proved by the proportions of their distances among\r\nthemselves; for, if the first of these two objects were as far from\r\nthe eye, as the 2nd from the first this would be called the second\r\nproportion: since, if the first is at 1 braccia from the eye and the\r\n2nd at two braccia, two being twice as much as one, the first object\r\nwill look twice as large as the second. But if you place the first\r\nat a hundred braccia from you and the second at a hundred and one,\r\nyou will find that the first is only so much larger than the second\r\nas 100 is less than 101; and the converse is equally true. And\r\nagain, the same thing is proved by the 4th of this book which shows\r\nthat among objects that are equal, there is the same proportion in\r\nthe diminution of the size as in the increase in the distance from\r\nthe eye of the spectator. On natural perspective (107--109). 107. OF EQUAL OBJECTS THE MOST REMOTE LOOK THE SMALLEST. The practice of perspective may be divided into ... parts [Footnote\r\n4: _in_ ... _parte_. The space for the number is left blank in the\r\noriginal.], of which the first treats of objects seen by the eye at\r\nany distance; and it shows all these objects just as the eye sees\r\nthem diminished, without obliging a man to stand in one place rather\r\nthan another so long as the plane does not produce a second\r\nforeshortening. But the second practice is a combination of perspective derived\r\npartly from art and partly from nature and the work done by its\r\nrules is in every portion of it, influenced by natural perspective\r\nand artificial perspective. By natural perspective I mean that the\r\nplane on which this perspective is represented is a flat surface,\r\nand this plane, although it is parallel both in length and height,\r\nis forced to diminish in its remoter parts more than in its nearer\r\nones. And this is proved by the first of what has been said above,\r\nand its diminution is natural. But artificial perspective, that is\r\nthat which is devised by art, does the contrary; for objects equal\r\nin size increase on the plane where it is foreshortened in\r\nproportion as the eye is more natural and nearer to the plane, and\r\nas the part of the plane on which it is figured is farther from the\r\neye. And let this plane be _d e_ on which are seen 3 equal circles which\r\nare beyond this plane _d e_, that is the circles _a b c_. Now you\r\nsee that the eye _h_ sees on the vertical plane the sections of the\r\nimages, largest of those that are farthest and smallest of the\r\nnearest. 108. Here follows what is wanting in the margin at the foot on the other\r\nside of this page. Natural perspective acts in a contrary way; for, at greater\r\ndistances the object seen appears smaller, and at a smaller distance\r\nthe object appears larger.

It is well\r\ntherefore to avoid such complex perspective and hold to simple\r\nperspective which does not regard planes as foreshortened, but as\r\nmuch as possible in their proper form. This simple perspective, in\r\nwhich the plane intersects the pyramids by which the images are\r\nconveyed to the eye at an equal distance from the eye is our\r\nconstant experience, from the curved form of the pupil of the eye on\r\nwhich the pyramids are intersected at an equal distance from the\r\nvisual virtue.

OF A MIXTURE OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL PERSPECTIVE. This diagram distinguishes natural from artificial perspective. But\r\nbefore proceeding any farther I will define what is natural and what\r\nis artificial perspective. Natural perspective says that the more\r\nremote of a series of objects of equal size will look the smaller,\r\nand conversely, the nearer will look the larger and the apparent\r\nsize will diminish in proportion to the distance. But in artificial\r\nperspective when objects of unequal size are placed at various\r\ndistances, the smallest is nearer to the eye than the largest and\r\nthe greatest distance looks as though it were the least of all; and\r\nthe cause of this is the plane on which the objects are represented;\r\nand which is at unequal distances from the eye throughout its\r\nlength. And this diminution of the plane is natural, but the\r\nperspective shown upon it is artificial since it nowhere agrees with\r\nthe true diminution of the said plane. Whence it follows, that when\r\nthe eye is somewhat removed from the [station point of the]\r\nperspective that it has been gazing at, all the objects represented\r\nlook monstrous, and this does not occur in natural perspective,\r\nwhich has been defined above. Let us say then, that the square _a b\r\nc d_ figured above is foreshortened being seen by the eye situated\r\nin the centre of the side which is in front. But a mixture of\r\nartificial and natural perspective will be seen in this tetragon\r\ncalled _el main_ [Footnote 20: _el main_ is quite legibly written in\r\nthe original; the meaning and derivation of the word are equally\r\ndoubtful.], that is to say _e f g h_ which must appear to the eye of\r\nthe spectator to be equal to _a b c d_ so long as the eye remains in\r\nits first position between _c_ and _d_. And this will be seen to\r\nhave a good effect, because the natural perspective of the plane\r\nwill conceal the defects which would [otherwise] seem monstrous. _III._\r\n\r\n_Six books on Light and Shade._\r\n\r\n_Linear Perspective cannot be immediately followed by either the_\r\n\"prospettiva de' perdimenti\" _or the_ \"prospettiva de' colori\" _or\r\nthe aerial perspective; since these branches of the subject\r\npresuppose a knowledge of the principles of Light and Shade.

Scheme of the books on Light and shade. 111. INTRODUCTION. [Having already treated of the nature of shadows and the way in\r\nwhich they are cast [Footnote 2: _Avendo io tractato._--We may\r\nsuppose that he here refers to some particular MS., possibly Paris\r\nC.], I will now consider the places on which they fall; and their\r\ncurvature, obliquity, flatness or, in short, any character I may be\r\nable to detect in them.]\r\n\r\nShadow is the obstruction of light. Shadows appear to me to be of\r\nsupreme importance in perspective, because, without them opaque and\r\nsolid bodies will be ill defined; that which is contained within\r\ntheir outlines and their boundaries themselves will be\r\nill-understood unless they are shown against a background of a\r\ndifferent tone from themselves. And therefore in my first\r\nproposition concerning shadow I state that every opaque body is\r\nsurrounded and its whole surface enveloped in shadow and light. And\r\non this proposition I build up the first Book. Besides this, shadows\r\nhave in themselves various degrees of darkness, because they are\r\ncaused by the absence of a variable amount of the luminous rays; and\r\nthese I call Primary shadows because they are the first, and\r\ninseparable from the object to which they belong. And on this I will\r\nfound my second Book. From these primary shadows there result\r\ncertain shaded rays which are diffused through the atmosphere and\r\nthese vary in character according to that of the primary shadows\r\nwhence they are derived. I shall therefore call these shadows\r\nDerived shadows because they are produced by other shadows; and the\r\nthird Book will treat of these. Again these derived shadows, where\r\nthey are intercepted by various objects, produce effects as various\r\nas the places where they are cast and of this I will treat in the\r\nfourth Book. And since all round the derived shadows, where the\r\nderived shadows are intercepted, there is always a space where the\r\nlight falls and by reflected dispersion is thrown back towards its\r\ncause, it meets the original shadow and mingles with it and modifies\r\nit somewhat in its nature; and on this I will compose my fifth Book. Besides this, in the sixth Book I will investigate the many and\r\nvarious diversities of reflections resulting from these rays which\r\nwill modify the original [shadow] by [imparting] some of the various\r\ncolours from the different objects whence these reflected rays are\r\nderived.", "sentences": ["It\r\nis also evident that he here investigates the subject from the point\r\nof view of the Physicist rather than from that of the Painter._\r\n\r\n_The plan of a scheme of arrangement suggested in No._ III _and\r\nadopted by me has been strictly adhered to for the first four Books.", "For the three last, however, few materials have come down to us; and\r\nit must be admitted that these three Books would find a far more\r\nappropriate place in a work on Physics than in a treatise on\r\nPainting.", "For this reason I have collected in Book V all the\r\nchapters on Reflections, and in Book VI I have put together and\r\narranged all the sections of MS._ C _that belong to the book on\r\nPainting, so far as they relate to Light and Shade, while the\r\nsections of the same MS.", "which treat of the_ \"Prospettiva de'\r\nperdimenti\" _have, of course, been excluded from the series on Light\r\nand Shade._\r\n\r\n[Footnote III: This text has already been published with some slight\r\nvariations in Dozio's pamphlet _Degli scritti e disegni di Leonardo\r\nda Vinci_, Milan 1871, pp.", "30--31.", "Dozio did not transcribe it from\r\nthe original MS.", "which seems to have remained unknown to him, but\r\nfrom an old copy (MS.", "H.", "227 in the Ambrosian Library).]\r\n\r\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION.", "Prolegomena.", "110.", "You must first explain the theory and then the practice.", "First you\r\nmust describe the shadows and lights on opaque objects, and then on\r\ntransparent bodies.", "Scheme of the books on Light and shade.", "111.", "INTRODUCTION.", "[Having already treated of the nature of shadows and the way in\r\nwhich they are cast [Footnote 2: _Avendo io tractato._--We may\r\nsuppose that he here refers to some particular MS., possibly Paris\r\nC.], I will now consider the places on which they fall; and their\r\ncurvature, obliquity, flatness or, in short, any character I may be\r\nable to detect in them.]\r\n\r\nShadow is the obstruction of light.", "Shadows appear to me to be of\r\nsupreme importance in perspective, because, without them opaque and\r\nsolid bodies will be ill defined; that which is contained within\r\ntheir outlines and their boundaries themselves will be\r\nill-understood unless they are shown against a background of a\r\ndifferent tone from themselves.", "And therefore in my first\r\nproposition concerning shadow I state that every opaque body is\r\nsurrounded and its whole surface enveloped in shadow and light.", "And\r\non this proposition I build up the first Book.", "Besides this, shadows\r\nhave in themselves various degrees of darkness, because they are\r\ncaused by the absence of a variable amount of the luminous rays; and\r\nthese I call Primary shadows because they are the first, and\r\ninseparable from the object to which they belong.", "And on this I will\r\nfound my second Book.", "From these primary shadows there result\r\ncertain shaded rays which are diffused through the atmosphere and\r\nthese vary in character according to that of the primary shadows\r\nwhence they are derived.", "I shall therefore call these shadows\r\nDerived shadows because they are produced by other shadows; and the\r\nthird Book will treat of these.", "Again these derived shadows, where\r\nthey are intercepted by various objects, produce effects as various\r\nas the places where they are cast and of this I will treat in the\r\nfourth Book.", "And since all round the derived shadows, where the\r\nderived shadows are intercepted, there is always a space where the\r\nlight falls and by reflected dispersion is thrown back towards its\r\ncause, it meets the original shadow and mingles with it and modifies\r\nit somewhat in its nature; and on this I will compose my fifth Book.", "Besides this, in the sixth Book I will investigate the many and\r\nvarious diversities of reflections resulting from these rays which\r\nwill modify the original [shadow] by [imparting] some of the various\r\ncolours from the different objects whence these reflected rays are\r\nderived."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_34", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 34)", "language": "it", "content": "Again, the seventh Book will treat of the various distances\r\nthat may exist between the spot where the reflected rays fall and\r\nthat where they originate, and the various shades of colour which\r\nthey will acquire in falling on opaque bodies.

First I will treat of light falling through windows which I will\r\ncall Restricted [Light] and then I will treat of light in the open\r\ncountry, to which I will give the name of diffused Light. Then I\r\nwill treat of the light of luminous bodies. 113. OF PAINTING. The conditions of shadow and light [as seen] by the eye are 3. Of\r\nthese the first is when the eye and the light are on the same side\r\nof the object seen; the 2nd is when the eye is in front of the\r\nobject and the light is behind it. The 3rd is when the eye is in\r\nfront of the object and the light is on one side, in such a way as\r\nthat a line drawn from the object to the eye and one from the object\r\nto the light should form a right angle where they meet. 114. OF PAINTING. This is another section: that is, of the nature of a reflection\r\n(from) an object placed between the eye and the light under various\r\naspects. 115. OF PAINTING. As regards all visible objects 3 things must be considered. These\r\nare the position of the eye which sees: that of the object seen\r\n[with regard] to the light, and the position of the light which\r\nilluminates the object, _b_ is the eye, _a_ the object seen, _c_ the\r\nlight, _a_ is the eye, _b_ the illuminating body, _c_ is the\r\nilluminated object. 116. Let _a_ be the light, _b_ the eye, _c_ the object seen by the eye\r\nand in the light. These show, first, the eye between the light and\r\nthe body; the 2nd, the light between the eye and the body; the 3rd\r\nthe body between the eye and the light, _a_ is the eye, _b_ the\r\nilluminated object, _c_ the light. 117. OF PAINTING. OF THE THREE KINDS OF LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATE OPAQUE BODIES. The first kind of Light which may illuminate opaque bodies is called\r\nDirect light--as that of the sun or any other light from a window or\r\nflame. The second is Diffused [universal] light, such as we see in\r\ncloudy weather or in mist and the like. The 3rd is Subdued light,\r\nthat is when the sun is entirely below the horizon, either in the\r\nevening or morning. 118. OF LIGHT. The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These\r\nare: diffused light as that of the atmosphere, within our horizon. And Direct, as that of the sun, or of a window or door or other\r\nopening. The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is\r\nthat which passes through [semi] transparent bodies, as linen or\r\npaper or the like, but not transparent like glass, or crystal, or\r\nother diaphanous bodies, which produce the same effect as though\r\nnothing intervened between the shaded object and the light that\r\nfalls upon it; and this we will discuss fully in our discourse. Definition of the nature of shadows (119--122). 119. WHAT LIGHT AND SHADOW ARE. Shadow is the absence of light, merely the obstruction of the\r\nluminous rays by an opaque body. Shadow is of the nature of\r\ndarkness. Light [on an object] is of the nature of a luminous body;\r\none conceals and the other reveals. They are always associated and\r\ninseparable from all objects. But shadow is a more powerful agent\r\nthan light, for it can impede and entirely deprive bodies of their\r\nlight, while light can never entirely expel shadow from a body, that\r\nis from an opaque body. 120. Shadow is the diminution of light by the intervention of an opaque\r\nbody. Shadow is the counterpart of the luminous rays which are cut\r\noff by an opaque body. This is proved because the shadow cast is the same in shape and size\r\nas the luminous rays were which are transformed into a shadow. 121. Shadow is the diminution alike of light and of darkness, and stands\r\nbetween darkness and light. A shadow may be infinitely dark, and also of infinite degrees of\r\nabsence of darkness.", "sentences": ["Again, the seventh Book will treat of the various distances\r\nthat may exist between the spot where the reflected rays fall and\r\nthat where they originate, and the various shades of colour which\r\nthey will acquire in falling on opaque bodies.", "Different principles and plans of treatment (112--116).", "112.", "First I will treat of light falling through windows which I will\r\ncall Restricted [Light] and then I will treat of light in the open\r\ncountry, to which I will give the name of diffused Light.", "Then I\r\nwill treat of the light of luminous bodies.", "113.", "OF PAINTING.", "The conditions of shadow and light [as seen] by the eye are 3.", "Of\r\nthese the first is when the eye and the light are on the same side\r\nof the object seen; the 2nd is when the eye is in front of the\r\nobject and the light is behind it.", "The 3rd is when the eye is in\r\nfront of the object and the light is on one side, in such a way as\r\nthat a line drawn from the object to the eye and one from the object\r\nto the light should form a right angle where they meet.", "114.", "OF PAINTING.", "This is another section: that is, of the nature of a reflection\r\n(from) an object placed between the eye and the light under various\r\naspects.", "115.", "OF PAINTING.", "As regards all visible objects 3 things must be considered.", "These\r\nare the position of the eye which sees: that of the object seen\r\n[with regard] to the light, and the position of the light which\r\nilluminates the object, _b_ is the eye, _a_ the object seen, _c_ the\r\nlight, _a_ is the eye, _b_ the illuminating body, _c_ is the\r\nilluminated object.", "116.", "Let _a_ be the light, _b_ the eye, _c_ the object seen by the eye\r\nand in the light.", "These show, first, the eye between the light and\r\nthe body; the 2nd, the light between the eye and the body; the 3rd\r\nthe body between the eye and the light, _a_ is the eye, _b_ the\r\nilluminated object, _c_ the light.", "117.", "OF PAINTING.", "OF THE THREE KINDS OF LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATE OPAQUE BODIES.", "The first kind of Light which may illuminate opaque bodies is called\r\nDirect light--as that of the sun or any other light from a window or\r\nflame.", "The second is Diffused [universal] light, such as we see in\r\ncloudy weather or in mist and the like.", "The 3rd is Subdued light,\r\nthat is when the sun is entirely below the horizon, either in the\r\nevening or morning.", "118.", "OF LIGHT.", "The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds.", "These\r\nare: diffused light as that of the atmosphere, within our horizon.", "And Direct, as that of the sun, or of a window or door or other\r\nopening.", "The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is\r\nthat which passes through [semi] transparent bodies, as linen or\r\npaper or the like, but not transparent like glass, or crystal, or\r\nother diaphanous bodies, which produce the same effect as though\r\nnothing intervened between the shaded object and the light that\r\nfalls upon it; and this we will discuss fully in our discourse.", "Definition of the nature of shadows (119--122).", "119.", "WHAT LIGHT AND SHADOW ARE.", "Shadow is the absence of light, merely the obstruction of the\r\nluminous rays by an opaque body.", "Shadow is of the nature of\r\ndarkness.", "Light [on an object] is of the nature of a luminous body;\r\none conceals and the other reveals.", "They are always associated and\r\ninseparable from all objects.", "But shadow is a more powerful agent\r\nthan light, for it can impede and entirely deprive bodies of their\r\nlight, while light can never entirely expel shadow from a body, that\r\nis from an opaque body.", "120.", "Shadow is the diminution of light by the intervention of an opaque\r\nbody.", "Shadow is the counterpart of the luminous rays which are cut\r\noff by an opaque body.", "This is proved because the shadow cast is the same in shape and size\r\nas the luminous rays were which are transformed into a shadow.", "121.", "Shadow is the diminution alike of light and of darkness, and stands\r\nbetween darkness and light.", "A shadow may be infinitely dark, and also of infinite degrees of\r\nabsence of darkness."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_35", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 35)", "language": "it", "content": "The beginnings and ends of shadow lie between the light and darkness\r\nand may be infinitely diminished and infinitely increased. Shadow is\r\nthe means by which bodies display their form. The forms of bodies could not be understood in detail but for\r\nshadow. 122. OF THE NATURE OF SHADOW. Shadow partakes of the nature of universal matter. All such matters\r\nare more powerful in their beginning and grow weaker towards the\r\nend, I say at the beginning, whatever their form or condition may be\r\nand whether visible or invisible. And it is not from small\r\nbeginnings that they grow to a great size in time; as it might be a\r\ngreat oak which has a feeble beginning from a small acorn. Yet I may\r\nsay that the oak is most powerful at its beginning, that is where it\r\nsprings from the earth, which is where it is largest (To return:)\r\nDarkness, then, is the strongest degree of shadow and light is its\r\nleast. Therefore, O Painter, make your shadow darkest close to the\r\nobject that casts it, and make the end of it fading into light,\r\nseeming to have no end. Of the various kinds of shadows. (123-125). 123. Darkness is absence of light. Shadow is diminution of light. Primitive shadow is that which is inseparable from a body not in the\r\nlight. Derived shadow is that which is disengaged from a body in\r\nshadow and pervades the air. A cast transparent shadow is that which\r\nis surrounded by an illuminated surface. A simple shadow is one\r\nwhich receives no light from the luminous body which causes it. A\r\nsimple shadow begins within the line which starts from the edge of\r\nthe luminous body _a b_. 124. A simple shadow is one where no light at all interferes with it. A compound shadow is one which is somewhat illuminated by one or\r\nmore lights. 125. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHADOW THAT IS INSEPARABLE FROM A\r\nBODY AND A CAST SHADOW? An inseparable shadow is that which is never absent from the\r\nilluminated body. As, for instance a ball, which so long as it is in\r\nthe light always has one side in shadow which never leaves it for\r\nany movement or change of position in the ball. A separate shadow\r\nmay be and may not be produced by the body itself. Suppose the ball\r\nto be one braccia distant from a wall with a light on the opposite\r\nside of it; this light will throw upon the wall exactly as broad a\r\nshadow as is to be seen on the side of the ball that is turned\r\ntowards the wall. That portion of the cast shadow will not be\r\nvisible when the light is below the ball and the shadow is thrown up\r\ntowards the sky and finding no obstruction on its way is lost. 126. HOW THERE ARE 2 KINDS OF LIGHT, ONE SEPARABLE FROM, AND THE OTHER\r\nINSEPARABLE FROM BODIES. Of the various kinds of light (126, 127). Separate light is that which falls upon the body. Inseparable light\r\nis the side of the body that is illuminated by that light. One is\r\ncalled primary, the other derived. And, in the same way there are\r\ntwo kinds of shadow:--One primary and the other derived. The primary\r\nis that which is inseparable from the body, the derived is that\r\nwhich proceeds from the body conveying to the surface of the wall\r\nthe form of the body causing it. 127. How there are 2 different kinds of light; one being called diffused,\r\nthe other restricted. The diffused is that which freely illuminates\r\nobjects. The restricted is that which being admitted through an\r\nopening or window illuminates them on that side only. [Footnote: At the spot marked _A_ in the first diagram Leonardo\r\nwrote _lume costretto_ (restricted light).

MEMORANDUM OF THINGS I REQUIRE TO HAVE GRANTED [AS AXIOMS] IN MY\r\nEXPLANATION OF PERSPECTIVE. I ask to have this much granted me--to assert that every ray\r\npassing through air of equal density throughout, travels in a\r\nstraight line from its cause to the object or place it falls upon. FIRST BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE. On the nature of light (130. 131). 130. The reason by which we know that a light radiates from a single\r\ncentre is this: We plainly see that a large light is often much\r\nbroader than some small object which nevertheless--and although the\r\nrays [of the large light] are much more than twice the extent [of\r\nthe small body]--always has its shadow cast on the nearest surface\r\nvery visibly. Let _c f_ be a broad light and _n_ be the object in\r\nfront of it, casting a shadow on the plane, and let _a b_ be the\r\nplane. It is clear that it is not the broad light that will cast the\r\nshadow _n_ on the plane, but that the light has within it a centre\r\nis shown by this experiment. The shadow falls on the plane as is\r\nshown at _m o t r_. [Footnote 13: In the original MS. no explanatory text is placed\r\nafter this title-line; but a space is left for it and the text\r\nbeginning at line 15 comes next.] Why, to two [eyes] or in front of\r\ntwo eyes do 3 objects appear as two? Why, when you estimate the direction of an object with two sights\r\nthe nearer appears confused. I say that the eye projects an infinite\r\nnumber of lines which mingle or join those reaching it which come to\r\nit from the object looked at. And it is only the central and\r\nsensible line that can discern and discriminate colours and objects;\r\nall the others are false and illusory. And if you place 2 objects at\r\nhalf an arm's length apart if the nearer of the two is close to the\r\neye its form will remain far more confused than that of the second;\r\nthe reason is that the first is overcome by a greater number of\r\nfalse lines than the second and so is rendered vague. Light acts in the same manner, for in the effects of its lines\r\n(=rays), and particularly in perspective, it much resembles the eye;\r\nand its central rays are what cast the true shadow. When the object\r\nin front of it is too quickly overcome with dim rays it will cast a\r\nbroad and disproportionate shadow, ill defined; but when the object\r\nwhich is to cast the shadow and cuts off the rays near to the place\r\nwhere the shadow falls, then the shadow is distinct; and the more so\r\nin proportion as the light is far off, because at a long distance\r\nthe central ray is less overcome by false rays; because the lines\r\nfrom the eye and the solar and other luminous rays passing through\r\nthe atmosphere are obliged to travel in straight lines. Unless they\r\nare deflected by a denser or rarer air, when they will be bent at\r\nsome point, but so long as the air is free from grossness or\r\nmoisture they will preserve their direct course, always carrying the\r\nimage of the object that intercepts them back to their point of\r\norigin. And if this is the eye, the intercepting object will be seen\r\nby its colour, as well as by form and size. But if the intercepting\r\nplane has in it some small perforation opening into a darker\r\nchamber--not darker in colour, but by absence of light--you will see\r\nthe rays enter through this hole and transmitting to the plane\r\nbeyond all the details of the object they proceed from both as to\r\ncolour and form; only every thing will be upside down.", "sentences": ["The general distribution of shadow and light is that sum total of\r\nthe rays thrown off by a shaded or illuminated body passing through\r\nthe air without any interference and the spot which intercepts and\r\ncuts off the distribution of the dark and light rays.", "And the eye can best distinguish the forms of objects when it is\r\nplaced between the shaded and the illuminated parts.", "129.", "MEMORANDUM OF THINGS I REQUIRE TO HAVE GRANTED [AS AXIOMS] IN MY\r\nEXPLANATION OF PERSPECTIVE.", "I ask to have this much granted me--to assert that every ray\r\npassing through air of equal density throughout, travels in a\r\nstraight line from its cause to the object or place it falls upon.", "FIRST BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.", "On the nature of light (130.", "131).", "130.", "The reason by which we know that a light radiates from a single\r\ncentre is this: We plainly see that a large light is often much\r\nbroader than some small object which nevertheless--and although the\r\nrays [of the large light] are much more than twice the extent [of\r\nthe small body]--always has its shadow cast on the nearest surface\r\nvery visibly.", "Let _c f_ be a broad light and _n_ be the object in\r\nfront of it, casting a shadow on the plane, and let _a b_ be the\r\nplane.", "It is clear that it is not the broad light that will cast the\r\nshadow _n_ on the plane, but that the light has within it a centre\r\nis shown by this experiment.", "The shadow falls on the plane as is\r\nshown at _m o t r_.", "[Footnote 13: In the original MS.", "no explanatory text is placed\r\nafter this title-line; but a space is left for it and the text\r\nbeginning at line 15 comes next.] Why, to two [eyes] or in front of\r\ntwo eyes do 3 objects appear as two?", "Why, when you estimate the direction of an object with two sights\r\nthe nearer appears confused.", "I say that the eye projects an infinite\r\nnumber of lines which mingle or join those reaching it which come to\r\nit from the object looked at.", "And it is only the central and\r\nsensible line that can discern and discriminate colours and objects;\r\nall the others are false and illusory.", "And if you place 2 objects at\r\nhalf an arm's length apart if the nearer of the two is close to the\r\neye its form will remain far more confused than that of the second;\r\nthe reason is that the first is overcome by a greater number of\r\nfalse lines than the second and so is rendered vague.", "Light acts in the same manner, for in the effects of its lines\r\n(=rays), and particularly in perspective, it much resembles the eye;\r\nand its central rays are what cast the true shadow.", "When the object\r\nin front of it is too quickly overcome with dim rays it will cast a\r\nbroad and disproportionate shadow, ill defined; but when the object\r\nwhich is to cast the shadow and cuts off the rays near to the place\r\nwhere the shadow falls, then the shadow is distinct; and the more so\r\nin proportion as the light is far off, because at a long distance\r\nthe central ray is less overcome by false rays; because the lines\r\nfrom the eye and the solar and other luminous rays passing through\r\nthe atmosphere are obliged to travel in straight lines.", "Unless they\r\nare deflected by a denser or rarer air, when they will be bent at\r\nsome point, but so long as the air is free from grossness or\r\nmoisture they will preserve their direct course, always carrying the\r\nimage of the object that intercepts them back to their point of\r\norigin.", "And if this is the eye, the intercepting object will be seen\r\nby its colour, as well as by form and size.", "But if the intercepting\r\nplane has in it some small perforation opening into a darker\r\nchamber--not darker in colour, but by absence of light--you will see\r\nthe rays enter through this hole and transmitting to the plane\r\nbeyond all the details of the object they proceed from both as to\r\ncolour and form; only every thing will be upside down."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_37", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 37)", "language": "it", "content": "But the size\r\n[of the image] where the lines are reconstructed will be in\r\nproportion to the relative distance of the aperture from the plane\r\non which the lines fall [on one hand] and from their origin [on the\r\nother].

OF THE HIGHEST LIGHTS WHICH TURN AND MOVE AS THE EYE MOVES WHICH\r\nSEES THE OBJECT. Suppose the body to be the round object figured here and let the\r\nlight be at the point _a_, and let the illuminated side of the\r\nobject be _b c_ and the eye at the point _d_: I say that, as lustre\r\nis every where and complete in each part, if you stand at the point\r\n_d_ the lustre will appear at _c_, and in proportion as the eye\r\nmoves from _d_ to _a_, the lustre will move from _c_ to _n_. 134. OF PAINTING. Heigh light or lustre on any object is not situated [necessarily] in\r\nthe middle of an illuminated object, but moves as and where the eye\r\nmoves in looking at it. 135. OF LIGHT AND LUSTRE. What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on\r\nthe polished surface of opaque bodies? The lights which are produced from the polished surface of opaque\r\nbodies will be stationary on stationary objects even if the eye on\r\nwhich they strike moves. But reflected lights will, on those same\r\nobjects, appear in as many different places on the surface as\r\ndifferent positions are taken by the eye. WHAT BODIES HAVE LIGHT UPON THEM WITHOUT LUSTRE? Opaque bodies which have a hard and rough surface never display any\r\nlustre in any portion of the side on which the light falls. WHAT BODIES WILL DISPLAY LUSTRE BUT NOT LOOK ILLUMINATED? Those bodies which are opaque and hard with a hard surface reflect\r\nlight [lustre] from every spot on the illuminated side which is in a\r\nposition to receive light at the same angle of incidence as they\r\noccupy with regard to the eye; but, as the surface mirrors all the\r\nsurrounding objects, the illuminated [body] is not recognisable in\r\nthese portions of the illuminated body. 136.

SHOWS HOW LIGHT FROM ANY SIDE CONVERGES TO ONE POINT. Although the balls _a b c_ are lighted from one window,\r\nnevertheless, if you follow the lines of their shadows you will see\r\nthey intersect at a point forming the angle _n_. [Footnote: The diagram belonging to this passage is slightly\r\nsketched on Pl. XXXII; a square with three balls below it. The first\r\nthree lines of the text belonging to it are written above the sketch\r\nand the six others below it.]\r\n\r\n138. Every shadow cast by a body has a central line directed to a single\r\npoint produced by the intersection of luminous lines in the middle\r\nof the opening and thickness of the window. The proposition stated\r\nabove, is plainly seen by experiment. Thus if you draw a place with\r\na window looking northwards, and let this be _s f_, you will see a\r\nline starting from the horizon to the east, which, touching the 2\r\nangles of the window _o f_, reaches _d_; and from the horizon on the\r\nwest another line, touching the other 2 angles _r s_, and ending at\r\n_c_; and their intersection falls exactly in the middle of the\r\nopening and thickness of the window. Again, you can still better\r\nconfirm this proof by placing two sticks, as shown at _g h_; and you\r\nwill see the line drawn from the centre of the shadow directed to\r\nthe centre _m_ and prolonged to the horizon _n f_. [Footnote: _B_ here stands for _cerchio del' orizonte tramontano_ on\r\nthe original diagram (the circle of the horizon towards the North);\r\n_A_ for _levante_ (East) and _C_ for _ponete_ (West).]\r\n\r\n139. Every shadow with all its variations, which becomes larger as its\r\ndistance from the object is greater, has its external lines\r\nintersecting in the middle, between the light and the object. This\r\nproposition is very evident and is confirmed by experience. For, if\r\n_a b_ is a window without any object interposed, the luminous\r\natmosphere to the right hand at _a_ is seen to the left at _d_. And\r\nthe atmosphere at the left illuminates on the right at _c_, and the\r\nlines intersect at the point _m_. [Footnote: _A_ here stands for _levante_ (East), _B_ for _ponente_\r\n(West).]\r\n\r\n140. Every body in light and shade is situated between 2 pyramids one\r\ndark and the other luminous, one is visible the other is not. But\r\nthis only happens when the light enters by a window. Supposing _a b_\r\nto be the window and _r_ the body in light and shade, the light to\r\nthe right hand _z_ will pass the object to the left and go on to\r\n_p_; the light to the left at _k_ will pass to the right of the\r\nobject at _i_ and go on to _m_ and the two lines will intersect at\r\n_c_ and form a pyramid. Then again _a_ _b_ falls on the shaded body\r\nat _i_ _g_ and forms a pyramid _f_ _i_ _g_. _f_ will be dark because\r\nthe light _a_ _b_ can never fall there; _i_ _g_ _c_ will be\r\nilluminated because the light falls upon it. Light and shadow with regard to the position of the eye (141--145). 141.

Shadow is diminution of light. Darkness is absence of light. Shadow is divided into two kinds, of which the first is called\r\nprimary shadow, the second is derived shadow. The primary shadow is\r\nalways the basis of the derived shadow. The edges of the derived shadow are straight lines. [Footnote: The theory of the _ombra_ dirivativa_--a technical\r\nexpression for which there is no precise English equivalent is\r\nelaborately treated by Leonardo. But both text and diagrams (as Pl. IV, 1-3 and Pl. V) must at once convince the student that the\r\ndistinction he makes between _ombra primitiva_ and _ombra\r\ndirivativa_ is not merely justifiable but scientific. _Ombra\r\ndirivativa_ is by no means a mere abstract idea. This is easily\r\nproved by repeating the experiment made by Leonardo, and by filling\r\nwith smoke the room in which the existence of the _ombra dirivativa_\r\nis investigated, when the shadow becomes visible. Nor is it\r\ndifficult to perceive how much of Leonardo's teaching depended on\r\nthis theory. The recognised, but extremely complicated science of\r\ncast shadows--_percussione dell' ombre dirivative_ as Leonardo\r\ncalls them--is thus rendered more intelligible if not actually\r\nsimpler, and we must assume this theory as our chief guide through\r\nthe investigations which follow.]\r\n\r\nThe darkness of the derived shadow diminishes in proportion as it is\r\nremote from the primary shadow. Different sorts of derived shadows (160-162). 160. SHADOW AND LIGHT. The forms of shadows are three: inasmuch as if the solid body which\r\ncasts the shadow is equal (in size) to the light, the shadow\r\nresembles a column without any termination (in length). If the body\r\nis larger than the light the shadow resembles a truncated and\r\ninverted pyramid, and its length has also no defined termination. But if the body is smaller than the light, the shadow will resemble\r\na pyramid and come to an end, as is seen in eclipses of the moon. 161. OF SIMPLE DERIVED SHADOWS. The simple derived shadow is of two kinds: one kind which has its\r\nlength defined, and two kinds which are undefined; and the defined\r\nshadow is pyramidal. Of the two undefined, one is a column and the\r\nother spreads out; and all three have rectilinear outlines. But the\r\nconverging, that is the pyramidal, shadow proceeds from a body that\r\nis smaller than the light, and the columnar from a body equal in\r\nsize to the light, and the spreading shadow from a body larger than\r\nthe light; &c. OF COMPOUND DERIVED SHADOWS. Compound derived shadows are of two kinds; that is columnar and\r\nspreading. 162. OF SHADOW. Derived shadows are of three kinds of which one is spreading, the\r\nsecond columnar, the third converging to the point where the two\r\nsides meet and intersect, and beyond this intersection the sides are\r\ninfinitely prolonged or straight lines. And if you say, this shadow\r\nmust terminate at the angle where the sides meet and extend no\r\nfarther, I deny this, because above in the first on shadow I have\r\nproved: that a thing is completely terminated when no portion of it\r\ngoes beyond its terminating lines. Now here, in this shadow, we see\r\nthe converse of this, in as much as where this derived shadow\r\noriginates we obviously have the figures of two pyramids of shadow\r\nwhich meet at their angles. Hence, if, as [my] opponent says, the\r\nfirst pyramid of shadow terminates the derivative shadow at the\r\nangle whence it starts, then the second pyramid of shadow--so says\r\nthe adversary--must be caused by the angle and not from the body in\r\nshadow;

Of different shadows of equal strength that which is nearest the eye\r\nwill seem the least strong. Why is the shadow _e a b_ in the first grade of strength, _b c_ in\r\nthe second; _c d_ in the third? The reason is that as from _e a b_\r\nthe sky is nowhere visible, it gets no light whatever from the sky,\r\nand so has no direct [primary] light. _b c_ faces the portion of the\r\nsky _f g_ and is illuminated by it. _c d_ faces the sky at _h k_. _c\r\nd_, being exposed to a larger extent of sky than _b c_, it is\r\nreasonable that it should be more lighted. And thus, up to a certain\r\ndistance, the wall _a d_ will grow lighter for the reasons here\r\ngiven, until the darkness of the room overpowers the light from the\r\nwindow. 172. When the light of the atmosphere is restricted [by an opening] and\r\nilluminates bodies which cast shadows, these bodies being equally\r\ndistant from the centre of the window, that which is most obliquely\r\nplaced will cast the largest shadow beyond it. 173.

Among the shadows cast by\r\nbodies of equal mass but at unequal distances from the opening by\r\nwhich they are illuminated, that shadow will be the longest of the\r\nbody which is least in the light. And in proportion as one body is\r\nbetter illuminated than another its shadow will be shorter than\r\nanother. The proportion _n m_ and _e v k_ bear to _r t_ and _v x_\r\ncorresponds with that of the shadow _x_ to 4 and _y_. The reason why those bodies which are placed most in front of the\r\nmiddle of the window throw shorter shadows than those obliquely\r\nsituated is:--That the window appears in its proper form and to the\r\nobliquely placed ones it appears foreshortened; to those in the\r\nmiddle, the window shows its full size, to the oblique ones it\r\nappears smaller; the one in the middle faces the whole hemisphere\r\nthat is _e f_ and those on the side have only a strip; that is _q r_\r\nfaces _a b_; and _m n_ faces _c d_; the body in the middle having a\r\nlarger quantity of light than those at the sides is lighted from a\r\npoint much below its centre, and thus the shadow is shorter.

Let the light _a b_, be a window, and let\r\nthe dark wall in which this window is, be _b s_, that is, one of the\r\nsides of the wall. Then we may say that the line _p h_ is darker than any other part of\r\nthe space _o p c h_, because this line faces the whole surface in\r\nshadow of [Footnote: In the original the diagram is placed between\r\nlines 27 and 28.] the wall _b s_.

Why, at the intersections _a_, _b_ of the two compound shadows _e f_\r\nand _m e_, is a simple shadow pfoduced as at _e h_ and _m g_, while\r\nno such simple shadow is produced at the other two intersections _c\r\nd_ made by the very same compound shadows? ANSWER. Compound shadow are a mixture of light and shade and simple shadows\r\nare simply darkness. Hence, of the two lights _n_ and _o_, one falls\r\non the compound shadow from one side, and the other on the compound\r\nshadow from the other side, but where they intersect no light falls,\r\nas at _a b_; therefore it is a simple shadow. Where there is a\r\ncompound shadow one light or the other falls; and here a difficulty\r\narises for my adversary since he says that, where the compound\r\nshadows intersect, both the lights which produce the shadows must of\r\nnecessity fall and therefore these shadows ought to be neutralised;\r\ninasmuch as the two lights do not fall there, we say that the shadow\r\nis a simple one and where only one of the two lights falls, we say\r\nthe shadow is compound, and where both the lights fall the shadow is\r\nneutralised; for where both lights fall, no shadow of any kind is\r\nproduced, but only a light background limiting the shadow. Here I\r\nshall say that what my adversary said was true: but he only mentions\r\nsuch truths as are in his favour; and if we go on to the rest he\r\nmust conclude that my proposition is true. And that is: That if both\r\nlights fell on the point of intersection, the shadows would be\r\nneutralised. This I confess to be true if [neither of] the two\r\nshadows fell in the same spot; because, where a shadow and a light\r\nfall, a compound shadow is produced, and wherever two shadows or two\r\nequal lights fall, the shadow cannot vary in any part of it, the\r\nshadows and the lights both being equal. And this is proved in the\r\neighth [proposition] on proportion where it is said that if a given\r\nquantity has a single unit of force and resistance, a double\r\nquantity will have double force and double resistance. DEFINITION. The intersection _n_ is produced by the shadows caused by the light\r\n_b_, because this light _b_ produces the shadow _x b_, and the\r\nshadow _s b_, but the intersection _m_ is produced by the light _a_\r\nwhich causes the shadow _s a_, and the shadow _x a_. But if you uncover both the lights _a b_, then you get the two\r\nshadows _n m_ both at once, and besides these, two other, simple\r\nshadows are produced at _r o_ where neither of the two lights falls\r\nat all. The grades of depth in compound shadows are fewer in\r\nproportion as the lights falling on, and crossing them are less\r\nnumerous. 186. Why the intersections at _n_ being composed of two compound derived\r\nshadows, forms a compound shadow and not a simple one, as happens\r\nwith other intersections of compound shadows. This occurs, according\r\nto the 2nd [diagram] of this [prop.] which says:--The intersection\r\nof derived shadows when produced by the intersection of columnar\r\nshadows caused by a single light does not produce a simple shadow. And this is the corollary of the 1st [prop.] which says:--The\r\nintersection of simple derived shadows never results in a deeper\r\nshadow, because the deepest shadows all added together cannot be\r\ndarker than one by itself. Since, if many deepest shadows increased\r\nin depth by their duplication, they could not be called the\r\n_deepest_ shadows, but only part-shadows.", "sentences": ["The fifth is less deep in shadow than either of the others because\r\nit is always entirely exposed to one of the lights and to the whole\r\nor part of the other; and it is less deep in proportion as it is\r\nnearer to the two lights, and in proportion as it is turned towards\r\nthe outer side _x t_; because it is more exposed to the second light\r\n_a b_.", "[Footnote: The diagram to this section is given on Pl.", "V.", "To the\r\nleft is the facsimile of the beginning of the text belonging to it.]\r\n\r\n184.", "OF SIMPLE SHADOWS.", "Why, at the intersections _a_, _b_ of the two compound shadows _e f_\r\nand _m e_, is a simple shadow pfoduced as at _e h_ and _m g_, while\r\nno such simple shadow is produced at the other two intersections _c\r\nd_ made by the very same compound shadows?", "ANSWER.", "Compound shadow are a mixture of light and shade and simple shadows\r\nare simply darkness.", "Hence, of the two lights _n_ and _o_, one falls\r\non the compound shadow from one side, and the other on the compound\r\nshadow from the other side, but where they intersect no light falls,\r\nas at _a b_; therefore it is a simple shadow.", "Where there is a\r\ncompound shadow one light or the other falls; and here a difficulty\r\narises for my adversary since he says that, where the compound\r\nshadows intersect, both the lights which produce the shadows must of\r\nnecessity fall and therefore these shadows ought to be neutralised;\r\ninasmuch as the two lights do not fall there, we say that the shadow\r\nis a simple one and where only one of the two lights falls, we say\r\nthe shadow is compound, and where both the lights fall the shadow is\r\nneutralised; for where both lights fall, no shadow of any kind is\r\nproduced, but only a light background limiting the shadow.", "Here I\r\nshall say that what my adversary said was true: but he only mentions\r\nsuch truths as are in his favour; and if we go on to the rest he\r\nmust conclude that my proposition is true.", "And that is: That if both\r\nlights fell on the point of intersection, the shadows would be\r\nneutralised.", "This I confess to be true if [neither of] the two\r\nshadows fell in the same spot; because, where a shadow and a light\r\nfall, a compound shadow is produced, and wherever two shadows or two\r\nequal lights fall, the shadow cannot vary in any part of it, the\r\nshadows and the lights both being equal.", "And this is proved in the\r\neighth [proposition] on proportion where it is said that if a given\r\nquantity has a single unit of force and resistance, a double\r\nquantity will have double force and double resistance.", "DEFINITION.", "The intersection _n_ is produced by the shadows caused by the light\r\n_b_, because this light _b_ produces the shadow _x b_, and the\r\nshadow _s b_, but the intersection _m_ is produced by the light _a_\r\nwhich causes the shadow _s a_, and the shadow _x a_.", "But if you uncover both the lights _a b_, then you get the two\r\nshadows _n m_ both at once, and besides these, two other, simple\r\nshadows are produced at _r o_ where neither of the two lights falls\r\nat all.", "The grades of depth in compound shadows are fewer in\r\nproportion as the lights falling on, and crossing them are less\r\nnumerous.", "186.", "Why the intersections at _n_ being composed of two compound derived\r\nshadows, forms a compound shadow and not a simple one, as happens\r\nwith other intersections of compound shadows.", "This occurs, according\r\nto the 2nd [diagram] of this [prop.] which says:--The intersection\r\nof derived shadows when produced by the intersection of columnar\r\nshadows caused by a single light does not produce a simple shadow.", "And this is the corollary of the 1st [prop.] which says:--The\r\nintersection of simple derived shadows never results in a deeper\r\nshadow, because the deepest shadows all added together cannot be\r\ndarker than one by itself.", "Since, if many deepest shadows increased\r\nin depth by their duplication, they could not be called the\r\n_deepest_ shadows, but only part-shadows."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_47", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 47)", "language": "it", "content": "But if such intersections\r\nare illuminated by a second light placed between the eye and the\r\nintersecting bodies, then those shadows would become compound\r\nshadows and be uniformly dark just as much at the intersection as\r\nthroughout the rest.

HOW AND WHEN THE SURROUNDINGS IN SHADOW MINGLE THEIR DERIVED SHADOW\r\nWITH THE LIGHT DERIVED FROM THE LUMINOUS BODY. The derived shadow of the dark walls on each side of the bright\r\nlight of the window are what mingle their various degrees of shade\r\nwith the light derived from the window; and these various depths of\r\nshade modify every portion of the light, except where it is\r\nstrongest, at _c_. To prove this let _d a_ be the primary shadow\r\nwhich is turned towards the point _e_, and darkens it by its derived\r\nshadow; as may be seen by the triangle _a e d_, in which the\r\nangle _e_ faces the darkened base _d a e_; the point _v_ faces the\r\ndark shadow _a s_ which is part of _a d_, and as the whole is\r\ngreater than a part, _e_ which faces the whole base [of the\r\ntriangle], will be in deeper shadow than _v_ which only faces part\r\nof it. In consequence of the conclusion [shown] in the above\r\ndiagram, _t_ will be less darkened than _v_, because the base of the\r\n_t_ is part of the base of the _v_; and in the same way it follows\r\nthat _p_ is less in shadow than _t_, because the base of the _p_ is\r\npart of the base of the _t_. And _c_ is the terminal point of the\r\nderived shadow and the chief beginning of the highest light. [Footnote: The diagram on Pl. IV, No. 5 belongs to this passage; but\r\nit must be noted that the text explains only the figure on the\r\nright-hand side.]\r\n\r\nFOURTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE. On the shape of the cast shadows (188-191). 188. The form of the shadow cast by any body of uniform density can never\r\nbe the same as that of the body producing it. [Footnote: Comp. the\r\ndrawing on PI. XXVIII, No. 5.]\r\n\r\n189. No cast shadow can produce the true image of the body which casts it\r\non a vertical plane unless the centre of the light is equally\r\ndistant from all the edges of that body. 190. If a window _a b_ admits the sunlight into a room, the sunlight will\r\nmagnify the size of the window and diminish the shadow of a man in\r\nsuch a way as that when the man makes that dim shadow of himself,\r\napproach to that which defines the real size of the window, he will\r\nsee the shadows where they come into contact, dim and confused from\r\nthe strength of the light, shutting off and not allowing the solar\r\nrays to pass; the effect of the shadow of the man cast by this\r\ncontact will be exactly that figured above. [Footnote: It is scarcely possible to render the meaning of this\r\nsentence with strict accuracy; mainly because the grammatical\r\nconstruction is defective in the most important part--line 4. In the\r\nvery slight original sketch the shadow touches the upper arch of the\r\nwindow and the correction, here given is perhaps not justified.]\r\n\r\n191. A shadow is never seen as of uniform depth on the surface which\r\nintercepts it unless every portion of that surface is equidistant\r\nfrom the luminous body.

If an object placed in front of a single light is very close to it\r\nyou will see that it casts a very large shadow on the opposite wall,\r\nand the farther you remove the object from the light the smaller\r\nwill the image of the shadow become. WHY A SHADOW LARGER THAN THE BODY THAT PRODUCES IT BECOMES OUT OF\r\nPROPORTION. The disproportion of a shadow which is larger than the body\r\nproducing it, results from the light being smaller than the body, so\r\nthat it cannot be at an equal distance from the edges of the body\r\n[Footnote 11: H. LUDWIG in his edition of the old copies, in the\r\nVatican library--in which this chapter is included under Nos. 612,\r\n613 and 614 alters this passage as follows: _quella parte ch'e piu\r\npropinqua piu cresce che le distanti_, although the Vatican copy\r\nagrees with the original MS. in having _distante_ in the former and\r\n_propinque_ in the latter place. This supposed amendment seems to me\r\nto invert the facts. Supposing for instance, that on Pl. XXXI No. 3. _f_ is the spot where the light is that illuminates the figure there\r\nrepresented, and that the line behind the figure represents a wall\r\non which the shadow of the figure is thrown. It is evident, that in\r\nthat case the nearest portion, in this case the under part of the\r\nthigh, is very little magnified in the shadow, and the remoter\r\nparts, for instance the head, are more magnified.]; and the portions\r\nwhich are most remote are made larger than the nearer portions for\r\nthis reason [Footnote 12: See Footnote 11]. WHY A SHADOW WHICH IS LARGER THAN THE BODY CAUSING IT HAS\r\nILL-DEFINED OUTLINES. The atmosphere which surrounds a light is almost like light itself\r\nfor brightness and colour; but the farther off it is the more it\r\nloses this resemblance. An object which casts a large shadow and is\r\nnear to the light, is illuminated both by that light by the luminous\r\natmosphere; hence this diffused light gives the shadow ill-defined\r\nedges. 197. A luminous body which is long and narrow in shape gives more\r\nconfused outlines to the derived shadow than a spherical light, and\r\nthis contradicts the proposition next following: A shadow will have\r\nits outlines more clearly defined in proportion as it is nearer to\r\nthe primary shadow or, I should say, the body casting the shadow;\r\n[Footnote 14: The lettering refers to the lower diagram, Pl.

OF THE OPINION OF SOME THAT A TRIANGLE CASTS NO SHADOW ON A PLANE\r\nSURFACE. Certain mathematicians have maintained that a triangle, of which the\r\nbase is turned to the light, casts no shadow on a plane; and this\r\nthey prove by saying [5] that no spherical body smaller than the\r\nlight can reach the middle with the shadow. The lines of radiant\r\nlight are straight lines [6]; therefore, suppose the light to be _g\r\nh_ and the triangle _l m n_, and let the plane be _i k_; they say\r\nthe light _g_ falls on the side of the triangle _l n_, and the\r\nportion of the plane _i q_. Thus again _h_ like _g_ falls on the\r\nside _l m_, and then on _m n_ and the plane _p k_; and if the whole\r\nplane thus faces the lights _g h_, it is evident that the triangle\r\nhas no shadow; and that which has no shadow can cast none. This, in\r\nthis case appears credible. But if the triangle _n p g_ were not\r\nilluminated by the two lights _g_ and _h_, but by _i p_ and _g_ and\r\n_k_ neither side is lighted by more than one single light: that is\r\n_i p_ is invisible to _h g_ and _k_ will never be lighted by _g_;\r\nhence _p q_ will be twice as light as the two visible portions that\r\nare in shadow.

A spot is most in the shade when a large number of darkened rays\r\nfall upon it. The spot which receives the rays at the widest angle\r\nand by darkened rays will be most in the dark; a will be twice as\r\ndark as b, because it originates from twice as large a base at an\r\nequal distance. A spot is most illuminated when a large number of\r\nluminous rays fall upon it. d is the beginning of the shadow _d f_,\r\nand tinges _c_ but _a_ little; _d e_ is half of the shadow _d f_ and\r\ngives a deeper tone where it is cast at _b_ than at _f_. And the\r\nwhole shaded space _e_ gives its tone to the spot _a_. [Footnote:\r\nThe diagram here referred to is on Pl. XLI, No. 2.]\r\n\r\n201. _A n_ will be darker than _c r_ in proportion to the number of times\r\nthat _a b_ goes into _c d_. 202. The shadow cast by an object on a plane will be smaller in\r\nproportion as that object is lighted by feebler rays. Let _d e_ be\r\nthe object and _d c_ the plane surface; the number of times that _d\r\ne_ will go into _f g_ gives the proportion of light at _f h_ to _d\r\nc_. The ray of light will be weaker in proportion to its distance\r\nfrom the hole through which it falls. FIFTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE. Principles of reflection (203. 204). 203. OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE SHADOWS CAST BY OBJECTS OUGHT TO BE DEFINED. If the object is the mountain here figured, and the light is at the\r\npoint _a_, I say that from _b d_ and also from _c f_ there will be\r\nno light but from reflected rays. And this results from the fact\r\nthat rays of light can only act in straight lines; and the same is\r\nthe case with the secondary or reflected rays. 204.

Borrowed\r\nlight will be reflected light; but to return to the promised\r\ndefinition: I say that this luminous reverberation is not produced\r\nby those portions of a body which are turned towards darkened\r\nobjects, such as shaded spots, fields with grass of various height,\r\nwoods whether green or bare; in which, though that side of each\r\nbranch which is turned towards the original light has a share of\r\nthat light, nevertheless the shadows cast by each branch separately\r\nare so numerous, as well as those cast by one branch on the others,\r\nthat finally so much shadow is the result that the light counts for\r\nnothing.

The shadow or object mirrored in water in motion, that is to say in\r\nsmall wavelets, will always be larger than the external object\r\nproducing it. 207. It is impossible that an object mirrored on water should correspond\r\nin form to the object mirrored, since the centre of the eye is above\r\nthe surface of the water. This is made plain in the figure here given, which demonstrates that\r\nthe eye sees the surface _a b_, and cannot see it at _l f_, and at\r\n_r t_; it sees the surface of the image at _r t_, and does not see\r\nit in the real object _c d_. Hence it is impossible to see it, as\r\nhas been said above unless the eye itself is situated on the surface\r\nof the water as is shown below [13]. [Footnote: _A_ stands for _ochio_ [eye], _B_ for _aria_ [air], _C_\r\nfor _acqua_ [water], _D_ for _cateto_ [cathetus].--In the original\r\nMS. the second diagram is placed below line 13.]\r\n\r\nExperiments with the mirror (208-210). 208. THE MIRROR. If the illuminated object is of the same size as the luminous body\r\nand as that in which the light is reflected, the amount of the\r\nreflected light will bear the same proportion to the intermediate\r\nlight as this second light will bear to the first, if both bodies\r\nare smooth and white. 209. Describe how it is that no object has its limitation in the mirror\r\nbut in the eye which sees it in the mirror. For if you look at your\r\nface in the mirror, the part resembles the whole in as much as the\r\npart is everywhere in the mirror, and the whole is in every part of\r\nthe same mirror; and the same is true of the whole image of any\r\nobject placed opposite to this mirror, &c. 210. No man can see the image of another man in a mirror in its proper\r\nplace with regard to the objects; because every object falls on [the\r\nsurface of] the mirror at equal angles. And if the one man, who sees\r\nthe other in the mirror, is not in a direct line with the image he\r\nwill not see it in the place where it really falls; and if he gets\r\ninto the line, he covers the other man and puts himself in the place\r\noccupied by his image. Let _n o_ be the mirror, _b_ the eye of your\r\nfriend and _d_ your own eye.

When two bodies casting shadows, and one in front of the other, are\r\nbetween a window and the wall with some space between them, the\r\nshadow of the body which is nearest to the plane of the wall will\r\nmove if the body nearest to the window is put in transverse motion\r\nacross the window.", "sentences": ["All dense bodies have their surfaces occupied by various degrees of\r\nlight and shade.", "The lights are of two kinds, one called original,\r\nthe other borrowed.", "Original light is that which is inherent in the\r\nflame of fire or the light of the sun or of the atmosphere.", "Borrowed\r\nlight will be reflected light; but to return to the promised\r\ndefinition: I say that this luminous reverberation is not produced\r\nby those portions of a body which are turned towards darkened\r\nobjects, such as shaded spots, fields with grass of various height,\r\nwoods whether green or bare; in which, though that side of each\r\nbranch which is turned towards the original light has a share of\r\nthat light, nevertheless the shadows cast by each branch separately\r\nare so numerous, as well as those cast by one branch on the others,\r\nthat finally so much shadow is the result that the light counts for\r\nnothing.", "Hence objects of this kind cannot throw any reflected light\r\non opposite objects.", "Reflection on water (206.", "207).", "206.", "PERSPECTIVE.", "The shadow or object mirrored in water in motion, that is to say in\r\nsmall wavelets, will always be larger than the external object\r\nproducing it.", "207.", "It is impossible that an object mirrored on water should correspond\r\nin form to the object mirrored, since the centre of the eye is above\r\nthe surface of the water.", "This is made plain in the figure here given, which demonstrates that\r\nthe eye sees the surface _a b_, and cannot see it at _l f_, and at\r\n_r t_; it sees the surface of the image at _r t_, and does not see\r\nit in the real object _c d_.", "Hence it is impossible to see it, as\r\nhas been said above unless the eye itself is situated on the surface\r\nof the water as is shown below [13].", "[Footnote: _A_ stands for _ochio_ [eye], _B_ for _aria_ [air], _C_\r\nfor _acqua_ [water], _D_ for _cateto_ [cathetus].--In the original\r\nMS.", "the second diagram is placed below line 13.]\r\n\r\nExperiments with the mirror (208-210).", "208.", "THE MIRROR.", "If the illuminated object is of the same size as the luminous body\r\nand as that in which the light is reflected, the amount of the\r\nreflected light will bear the same proportion to the intermediate\r\nlight as this second light will bear to the first, if both bodies\r\nare smooth and white.", "209.", "Describe how it is that no object has its limitation in the mirror\r\nbut in the eye which sees it in the mirror.", "For if you look at your\r\nface in the mirror, the part resembles the whole in as much as the\r\npart is everywhere in the mirror, and the whole is in every part of\r\nthe same mirror; and the same is true of the whole image of any\r\nobject placed opposite to this mirror, &c.", "210.", "No man can see the image of another man in a mirror in its proper\r\nplace with regard to the objects; because every object falls on [the\r\nsurface of] the mirror at equal angles.", "And if the one man, who sees\r\nthe other in the mirror, is not in a direct line with the image he\r\nwill not see it in the place where it really falls; and if he gets\r\ninto the line, he covers the other man and puts himself in the place\r\noccupied by his image.", "Let _n o_ be the mirror, _b_ the eye of your\r\nfriend and _d_ your own eye.", "Your friend's eye will appear to you at\r\n_a_, and to him it will seem that yours is at _c_, and the\r\nintersection of the visual rays will occur at _m_, so that either of\r\nyou touching _m_ will touch the eye of the other man which shall be\r\nopen.", "And if you touch the eye of the other man in the mirror it\r\nwill seem to him that you are touching your own.", "Appendix:--On shadows in movement (211.", "212).", "211.", "OF THE SHADOW AND ITS MOTION.", "When two bodies casting shadows, and one in front of the other, are\r\nbetween a window and the wall with some space between them, the\r\nshadow of the body which is nearest to the plane of the wall will\r\nmove if the body nearest to the window is put in transverse motion\r\nacross the window."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_51", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 51)", "language": "it", "content": "To prove this let _a_ and _b_ be two bodies\r\nplaced between the window _n m_ and the plane surface _o p_ with\r\nsufficient space between them as shown by the space _a b_.

The motion of a shadow is always more rapid than that of the body\r\nwhich produces it if the light is stationary. To prove this let _a_\r\nbe the luminous body, and _b_ the body casting the shadow, and _d_\r\nthe shadow. Then I say that in the time while the solid body moves\r\nfrom _b_ to _c_, the shadow _d_ will move to _e_; and this\r\nproportion in the rapidity of the movements made in the same space\r\nof time, is equal to that in the length of the space moved over. Thus, given the proportion of the space moved over by the body _b_\r\nto _c_, to that moved over by the shadow _d_ to _e_, the proportion\r\nin the rapidity of their movements will be the same. But if the luminous body is also in movement with a velocity equal\r\nto that of the solid body, then the shadow and the body that casts\r\nit will move with equal speed. And if the luminous body moves more\r\nrapidly than the solid body, the motion of the shadow will be slower\r\nthan that of the body casting it. But if the luminous body moves more slowly than the solid body, then\r\nthe shadow will move more rapidly than that body. SIXTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE. The effect of rays passing through holes (213. 214). 213. PERSPECTIVE. If you transmit the rays of the sun through a hole in the shape of a\r\nstar you will see a beautiful effect of perspective in the spot\r\nwhere the sun's rays fall. [Footnote: In this and the following chapters of MS. C the order of\r\nthe original paging has been adhered to, and is shown in\r\nparenthesis. Leonardo himself has but rarely worked out the subject\r\nof these propositions. The space left for the purpose has\r\noccasionally been made use of for quite different matter. Even the\r\nnumerous diagrams, most of them very delicately sketched, lettered\r\nand numbered, which occur on these pages, are hardly ever explained,\r\nwith the exception of those few which are here given.]\r\n\r\n214. No small hole can so modify the convergence of rays of light as to\r\nprevent, at a long distance, the transmission of the true form of\r\nthe luminous body causing them. It is impossible that rays of light\r\npassing through a parallel [slit], should not display the form of\r\nthe body causing them, since all the effects produced by a luminous\r\nbody are [in fact] the reflection of that body: The moon, shaped\r\nlike a boat, if transmitted through a hole is figured in the surface\r\n[it falls on] as a boatshaped object.

Although the breadth and length of lights and shadow will be\r\nnarrower and shorter in foreshortening, the quality and quantity of\r\nthe light and shade is not increased nor diminished. [3]The function of shade and light when diminished by\r\nforeshortening, will be to give shadow and to illuminate an object\r\nopposite, according to the quality and quantity in which they fall\r\non the body. [5]In proportion as a derived shadow is nearer to its penultimate\r\nextremities the deeper it will appear, _g z_ beyond the intersection\r\nfaces only the part of the shadow [marked] _y z_; this by\r\nintersection takes the shadow from _m n_ but by direct line it takes\r\nthe shadow _a m_ hence it is twice as deep as _g z_.", "sentences": ["To prove this let _a_ and _b_ be two bodies\r\nplaced between the window _n m_ and the plane surface _o p_ with\r\nsufficient space between them as shown by the space _a b_.", "I say\r\nthat if the body _a_ is moved towards _s_ the shadow of the body _b_\r\nwhich is at _c_ will move towards _d_.", "212.", "OF THE MOTION OF SHADOWS.", "The motion of a shadow is always more rapid than that of the body\r\nwhich produces it if the light is stationary.", "To prove this let _a_\r\nbe the luminous body, and _b_ the body casting the shadow, and _d_\r\nthe shadow.", "Then I say that in the time while the solid body moves\r\nfrom _b_ to _c_, the shadow _d_ will move to _e_; and this\r\nproportion in the rapidity of the movements made in the same space\r\nof time, is equal to that in the length of the space moved over.", "Thus, given the proportion of the space moved over by the body _b_\r\nto _c_, to that moved over by the shadow _d_ to _e_, the proportion\r\nin the rapidity of their movements will be the same.", "But if the luminous body is also in movement with a velocity equal\r\nto that of the solid body, then the shadow and the body that casts\r\nit will move with equal speed.", "And if the luminous body moves more\r\nrapidly than the solid body, the motion of the shadow will be slower\r\nthan that of the body casting it.", "But if the luminous body moves more slowly than the solid body, then\r\nthe shadow will move more rapidly than that body.", "SIXTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.", "The effect of rays passing through holes (213.", "214).", "213.", "PERSPECTIVE.", "If you transmit the rays of the sun through a hole in the shape of a\r\nstar you will see a beautiful effect of perspective in the spot\r\nwhere the sun's rays fall.", "[Footnote: In this and the following chapters of MS.", "C the order of\r\nthe original paging has been adhered to, and is shown in\r\nparenthesis.", "Leonardo himself has but rarely worked out the subject\r\nof these propositions.", "The space left for the purpose has\r\noccasionally been made use of for quite different matter.", "Even the\r\nnumerous diagrams, most of them very delicately sketched, lettered\r\nand numbered, which occur on these pages, are hardly ever explained,\r\nwith the exception of those few which are here given.]\r\n\r\n214.", "No small hole can so modify the convergence of rays of light as to\r\nprevent, at a long distance, the transmission of the true form of\r\nthe luminous body causing them.", "It is impossible that rays of light\r\npassing through a parallel [slit], should not display the form of\r\nthe body causing them, since all the effects produced by a luminous\r\nbody are [in fact] the reflection of that body: The moon, shaped\r\nlike a boat, if transmitted through a hole is figured in the surface\r\n[it falls on] as a boatshaped object.", "[Footnote 8: In the MS.", "a\r\nblank space is left after this question.] Why the eye sees bodies at\r\na distance, larger than they measure on the vertical plane?.", "[Footnote: This chapter, taken from another MS.", "may, as an\r\nexception, be placed here, as it refers to the same subject as the\r\npreceding section.]\r\n\r\nOn gradation of shadows (215.", "216).", "215.", "Although the breadth and length of lights and shadow will be\r\nnarrower and shorter in foreshortening, the quality and quantity of\r\nthe light and shade is not increased nor diminished.", "[3]The function of shade and light when diminished by\r\nforeshortening, will be to give shadow and to illuminate an object\r\nopposite, according to the quality and quantity in which they fall\r\non the body.", "[5]In proportion as a derived shadow is nearer to its penultimate\r\nextremities the deeper it will appear, _g z_ beyond the intersection\r\nfaces only the part of the shadow [marked] _y z_;

Compare also line 4 of No. 270.]\r\n\r\nOn relative proportion of light and shadows (216--221). 216. That part of the surface of a body on which the images [reflection]\r\nfrom other bodies placed opposite fall at the largest angle will\r\nassume their hue most strongly. In the diagram below, 8 is a larger\r\nangle than 4, since its base _a n_ is larger than _e n_ the base of\r\n4. This diagram below should end at _a n_ 4 8. [4]That portion of\r\nthe illuminated surface on which a shadow is cast will be brightest\r\nwhich lies contiguous to the cast shadow. Just as an object which is\r\nlighted up by a greater quantity of luminous rays becomes brighter,\r\nso one on which a greater quantity of shadow falls, will be darker. Let 4 be the side of an illuminated surface 4 8, surrounding the\r\ncast shadow _g e_ 4. And this spot 4 will be lighter than 8, because\r\nless shadow falls on it than on 8. Since 4 faces only the shadow _i\r\nn_; and 8 faces and receives the shadow _a e_ as well as _i n_ which\r\nmakes it twice as dark. And the same thing happens when you put the\r\natmosphere and the sun in the place of shade and light. [12] The distribution of shadow, originating in, and limited by,\r\nplane surfaces placed near to each other, equal in tone and directly\r\nopposite, will be darker at the ends than at the beginning, which\r\nwill be determined by the incidence of the luminous rays. You will\r\nfind the same proportion in the depth of the derived shadows _a n_\r\nas in the nearness of the luminous bodies _m b_, which cause them;\r\nand if the luminous bodies were of equal size you would still\r\nfarther find the same proportion in the light cast by the luminous\r\ncircles and their shadows as in the distance of the said luminous\r\nbodies.

THAT PART OF THE REFLECTION WILL BE BRIGHTEST WHERE THE REFLECTED\r\nRAYS ARE SHORTEST. [2] The darkness occasioned by the casting of combined shadows will\r\nbe in conformity with its cause, which will originate and terminate\r\nbetween two plane surfaces near together, alike in tone and directly\r\nopposite each other. [4] In proportion as the source of light is larger, the luminous and\r\nshadow rays will be more mixed together. This result is produced\r\nbecause wherever there is a larger quantity of luminous rays, there\r\nis most light, but where there are fewer there is least light,\r\nconsequently the shadow rays come in and mingle with them.

If the object is\r\nlowly moved across the luminous body, and the shadow is intercepted\r\nat some distance from the object, there will be the same relative\r\nproportion between the motion of the derived shadow and the motion\r\nof the primary shadow, as between the distance from the object to\r\nthe light, and that from the object to the spot where the shadow is\r\nintercepted; so that though the object is moved slowly the shadow\r\nmoves fast.

A luminous body will appear less brilliant when surrounded by a\r\nbright background. [2] I have found that the stars which are nearest to the horizon\r\nlook larger than the others because light falls upon them from a\r\nlarger proportion of the solar body than when they are above us; and\r\nhaving more light from the sun they give more light, and the bodies\r\nwhich are most luminous appear the largest. As may be seen by the\r\nsun through a mist, and overhead; it appears larger where there is\r\nno mist and diminished through mist. No portion of the luminous body\r\nis ever visible from any spot within the pyramid of pure derived\r\nshadow. [Footnote: Between lines 1 and 2 there is in the original a large\r\ndiagram which does not refer to this text. ]\r\n\r\n220. A body on which the solar rays fall between the thin branches of\r\ntrees far apart will cast but a single shadow. [2] If an opaque body and a luminous one are (both) spherical the\r\nbase of the pyramid of rays will bear the same proportion to the\r\nluminous body as the base of the pyramid of shade to the opaque\r\nbody. [4] When the transmitted shadow is intercepted by a plane surface\r\nplaced opposite to it and farther away from the luminous body than\r\nfrom the object [which casts it] it will appear proportionately\r\ndarker and the edges more distinct. [Footnote: The diagram which, in the original, is placed above line\r\n2, is similar to the one, here given on page 73 (section 120).--The\r\ndiagram here given in the margin stands, in the original, between\r\nlines 3 and 4.]\r\n\r\n221. A body illuminated by the solar rays passing between the thick\r\nbranches of trees will produce as many shadows as there are branches\r\nbetween the sun and itself. Where the shadow-rays from an opaque pyramidal body are intercepted\r\nthey will cast a shadow of bifurcate outline and various depth at\r\nthe points. A light which is broader than the apex but narrower than\r\nthe base of an opaque pyramidal body placed in front of it, will\r\ncause that pyramid to cast a shadow of bifurcate form and various\r\ndegrees of depth.

Definition (222. 223). 222. OF THE DIMINISHED DISTINCTNESS OF THE OUTLINES OF OPAQUE BODIES. If the real outlines of opaque bodies are indistinguishable at even\r\na very short distance, they will be more so at long distances; and,\r\nsince it is by its outlines that we are able to know the real form\r\nof any opaque body, when by its remoteness we fail to discern it as\r\na whole, much more must we fail to discern its parts and outlines. 223. OF THE DIMINUTION IN PERSPECTIVE OF OPAQUE OBJECTS. Among opaque objects of equal size the apparent diminution of size\r\nwill be in proportion to their distance from the eye of the\r\nspectator; but it is an inverse proportion, since, where the\r\ndistance is greater, the opaque body will appear smaller, and the\r\nless the distance the larger will the object appear. And this is the\r\nfundamental principle of linear perspective and it\r\nfollows:--[11]every object as it becomes more remote loses first\r\nthose parts which are smallest. Thus of a horse, we should lose the\r\nlegs before the head, because the legs are thinner than the head;\r\nand the neck before the body for the same reason. Hence it follows\r\nthat the last part of the horse which would be discernible by the\r\neye would be the mass of the body in an oval form, or rather in a\r\ncylindrical form and this would lose its apparent thickness before\r\nits length--according to the 2nd rule given above, &c. [Footnote 23:\r\nCompare line 11.]. If the eye remains stationary the perspective terminates in the\r\ndistance in a point. But if the eye moves in a straight [horizontal]\r\nline the perspective terminates in a line and the reason is that\r\nthis line is generated by the motion of the point and our sight;\r\ntherefore it follows that as we move our sight [eye], the point\r\nmoves, and as we move the point, the line is generated, &c. An illustration by experiment. 224. Every visible body, in so far as it affects the eye, includes three\r\nattributes; that is to say: mass, form and colour; and the mass is\r\nrecognisable at a greater distance from the place of its actual\r\nexistence than either colour or form. Again, colour is discernible\r\nat a greater distance than form, but this law does not apply to\r\nluminous bodies. The above proposition is plainly shown and proved by experiment;\r\nbecause: if you see a man close to you, you discern the exact\r\nappearance of the mass and of the form and also of the colouring; if\r\nhe goes to some distance you will not recognise who he is, because\r\nthe character of the details will disappear, if he goes still\r\nfarther you will not be able to distinguish his colouring, but he\r\nwill appear as a dark object, and still farther he will appear as a\r\nvery small dark rounded object. It appears rounded because distance\r\nso greatly diminishes the various details that nothing remains\r\nvisible but the larger mass.", "sentences": ["_It is in the\r\nvery nature of the case that the farther explanations given in the\r\nsubsequent chapters must be limited to general rules.", "The sections\r\ngiven as_ 227--231 _\"On indistinctness at short distances\" have, it\r\nis true, only an indirect bearing on the subject; but on the other\r\nhand, the following chapters,_ 232--234, _\"On indistinctness at\r\ngreat distances,\" go fully into the matter, and in chapters_\r\n235--239, _which treat \"Of the importance of light and shade in the\r\nPerspective of Disappearance\", the practical issues are distinctly\r\ninsisted on in their relation to the theory.", "This is naturally\r\nfollowed by the statements as to \"the effect of light or dark\r\nbackgrounds on the apparent size of bodies\"_ (_Nos._ 240--250).", "_At\r\nthe end I have placed, in the order of the original, those sections\r\nfrom the MS._ C _which treat of the \"Perspective of Disappearance\"\r\nand serve to some extent to complete the treatment of the subject_\r\n(251--262).", "Definition (222.", "223).", "222.", "OF THE DIMINISHED DISTINCTNESS OF THE OUTLINES OF OPAQUE BODIES.", "If the real outlines of opaque bodies are indistinguishable at even\r\na very short distance, they will be more so at long distances; and,\r\nsince it is by its outlines that we are able to know the real form\r\nof any opaque body, when by its remoteness we fail to discern it as\r\na whole, much more must we fail to discern its parts and outlines.", "223.", "OF THE DIMINUTION IN PERSPECTIVE OF OPAQUE OBJECTS.", "Among opaque objects of equal size the apparent diminution of size\r\nwill be in proportion to their distance from the eye of the\r\nspectator; but it is an inverse proportion, since, where the\r\ndistance is greater, the opaque body will appear smaller, and the\r\nless the distance the larger will the object appear.", "And this is the\r\nfundamental principle of linear perspective and it\r\nfollows:--[11]every object as it becomes more remote loses first\r\nthose parts which are smallest.", "Thus of a horse, we should lose the\r\nlegs before the head, because the legs are thinner than the head;\r\nand the neck before the body for the same reason.", "Hence it follows\r\nthat the last part of the horse which would be discernible by the\r\neye would be the mass of the body in an oval form, or rather in a\r\ncylindrical form and this would lose its apparent thickness before\r\nits length--according to the 2nd rule given above, &c.", "[Footnote 23:\r\nCompare line 11.].", "If the eye remains stationary the perspective terminates in the\r\ndistance in a point.", "But if the eye moves in a straight [horizontal]\r\nline the perspective terminates in a line and the reason is that\r\nthis line is generated by the motion of the point and our sight;\r\ntherefore it follows that as we move our sight [eye], the point\r\nmoves, and as we move the point, the line is generated, &c.", "An illustration by experiment.", "224.", "Every visible body, in so far as it affects the eye, includes three\r\nattributes; that is to say: mass, form and colour; and the mass is\r\nrecognisable at a greater distance from the place of its actual\r\nexistence than either colour or form.", "Again, colour is discernible\r\nat a greater distance than form, but this law does not apply to\r\nluminous bodies.", "The above proposition is plainly shown and proved by experiment;\r\nbecause: if you see a man close to you, you discern the exact\r\nappearance of the mass and of the form and also of the colouring; if\r\nhe goes to some distance you will not recognise who he is, because\r\nthe character of the details will disappear, if he goes still\r\nfarther you will not be able to distinguish his colouring, but he\r\nwill appear as a dark object, and still farther he will appear as a\r\nvery small dark rounded object.", "It appears rounded because distance\r\nso greatly diminishes the various details that nothing remains\r\nvisible but the larger mass."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_55", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 55)", "language": "it", "content": "And the reason is this: We know very\r\nwell that all the images of objects reach the senses by a small\r\naperture in the eye; hence, if the whole horizon _a d_ is admitted\r\nthrough such an aperture, the object _b c_ being but a very small\r\nfraction of this horizon what space can it fill in that minute image\r\nof so vast a hemisphere?

OF THE ATMOSPHERE THAT INTERPOSES BETWEEN THE EYE AND VISIBLE\r\nOBJECTS. An object will appear more or less distinct at the same distance, in\r\nproportion as the atmosphere existing between the eye and that\r\nobject is more or less clear. Hence, as I know that the greater or\r\nless quantity of the air that lies between the eye and the object\r\nmakes the outlines of that object more or less indistinct, you must\r\ndiminish the definiteness of outline of those objects in proportion\r\nto their increasing distance from the eye of the spectator. An experiment. 226. When I was once in a place on the sea, at an equal distance from the\r\nshore and the mountains, the distance from the shore looked much\r\ngreater than that from the mountains. On indistinctness at short distances (227-231). 227. If you place an opaque object in front of your eye at a distance of\r\nfour fingers' breadth, if it is smaller than the space between the\r\ntwo eyes it will not interfere with your seeing any thing that may\r\nbe beyond it. No object situated beyond another object seen by the\r\neye can be concealed by this [nearer] object if it is smaller than\r\nthe space from eye to eye. 228. The eye cannot take in a luminous angle which is too close to it. 229. That part of a surface will be better lighted on which the light\r\nfalls at the greater angle. And that part, on which the shadow falls\r\nat the greatest angle, will receive from those rays least of the\r\nbenefit of the light. 230. OF THE EYE. The edges of an object placed in front of the pupil of the eye will\r\nbe less distinct in proportion as they are closer to the eye. This\r\nis shown by the edge of the object _n_ placed in front of the pupil\r\n_d_; in looking at this edge the pupil also sees all the space _a c_\r\nwhich is beyond the edge; and the images the eye receives from that\r\nspace are mingled with the images of the edge, so that one image\r\nconfuses the other, and this confusion hinders the pupil from\r\ndistinguishing the edge. 231. The outlines of objects will be least clear when they are nearest to\r\nthe eye, and therefore remoter outlines will be clearer. Among\r\nobjects which are smaller than the pupil of the eye those will be\r\nless distinct which are nearer to the eye. On indistinctness at great distances (232-234). 232. Objects near to the eye will appear larger than those at a distance. Objects seen with two eyes will appear rounder than if they are seen\r\nwith only one. Objects seen between light and shadow will show the most relief. 233. OF PAINTING. Our true perception of an object diminishes in proportion as its\r\nsize is diminished by distance. 234. PERSPECTIVE. Why objects seen at a distance appear large to the eye and in the\r\nimage on the vertical plane they appear small. PERSPECTIVE. I ask how far away the eye can discern a non-luminous body, as, for\r\ninstance, a mountain. It will be very plainly visible if the sun is\r\nbehind it; and could be seen at a greater or less distance according\r\nto the sun's place in the sky.

Compare No. 535.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of light and shade in the perspective of\r\ndisappearance (235-239). 235. An opaque body seen in a line in which the light falls will reveal\r\nno prominences to the eye. For instance, let _a_ be the solid body\r\nand _c_ the light; _c m_ and _c n_ will be the lines of incidence of\r\nthe light, that is to say the lines which transmit the light to the\r\nobject _a_. The eye being at the point _b_, I say that since the\r\nlight _c_ falls on the whole part _m n_ the portions in relief on\r\nthat side will all be illuminated. Hence the eye placed at _c_\r\ncannot see any light and shade and, not seeing it, every portion\r\nwill appear of the same tone, therefore the relief in the prominent\r\nor rounded parts will not be visible. 236. OF PAINTING. When you represent in your work shadows which you can only discern\r\nwith difficulty, and of which you cannot distinguish the edges so\r\nthat you apprehend them confusedly, you must not make them sharp or\r\ndefinite lest your work should have a wooden effect. 237. OF PAINTING. You will observe in drawing that among the shadows some are of\r\nundistinguishable gradation and form, as is shown in the 3rd\r\n[proposition] which says: Rounded surfaces display as many degrees\r\nof light and shade as there are varieties of brightness and darkness\r\nreflected from the surrounding objects. 238. OF LIGHT AND SHADE. You who draw from nature, look (carefully) at the extent, the\r\ndegree, and the form of the lights and shadows on each muscle; and\r\nin their position lengthwise observe towards which muscle the axis\r\nof the central line is directed. 239. An object which is [so brilliantly illuminated as to be] almost as\r\nbright as light will be visible at a greater distance, and of larger\r\napparent size than is natural to objects so remote. The effect of light or dark backgrounds on the apparent size of\r\nobjects (240-250). 240. A shadow will appear dark in proportion to the brilliancy of the\r\nlight surrounding it and conversely it will be less conspicuous\r\nwhere it is seen against a darker background. 241. OF ORDINARY PERSPECTIVE. An object of equal breadth and colour throughout, seen against a\r\nbackground of various colours will appear unequal in breadth. And if an object of equal breadth throughout, but of various\r\ncolours, is seen against a background of uniform colour, that object\r\nwill appear of various breadth. And the more the colours of the\r\nbackground or of the object seen against the ground vary, the\r\ngreater will the apparent variations in the breadth be though the\r\nobjects seen against the ground be of equal breadth [throughout]. 242. A dark object seen against a bright background will appear smaller\r\nthan it is. A light object will look larger when it is seen against a background\r\ndarker than itself. 243. OF LIGHT. A luminous body when obscured by a dense atmosphere will appear\r\nsmaller; as may be seen by the moon or sun veiled by mists. OF LIGHT. Of several luminous bodies of equal size and brilliancy and at an\r\nequal distance, that will look the largest which is surrounded by\r\nthe darkest background. OF LIGHT. I find that any luminous body when seen through a dense and thick\r\nmist diminishes in proportion to its distance from the eye. Thus it\r\nis with the sun by day, as well as the moon and the other eternal\r\nlights by night. And when the air is clear, these luminaries appear\r\nlarger in proportion as they are farther from the eye. 244. That portion of a body of uniform breadth which is against a lighter\r\nbackground will look narrower [than the rest]. [4] _e_ is a given object, itself dark and of uniform breadth; _a b_\r\nand _c d_ are two backgrounds one darker than the other; _b c_ is a\r\nbright background, as it might be a spot lighted by the sun through\r\nan aperture in a dark room.", "sentences": ["Objects seen with both eyes appear\r\nsolid since they are seen from two distinct points of sight\r\nseparated by the distance between the eyes, but this solidity cannot\r\nbe represented in a flat drawing.", "Compare No.", "535.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of light and shade in the perspective of\r\ndisappearance (235-239).", "235.", "An opaque body seen in a line in which the light falls will reveal\r\nno prominences to the eye.", "For instance, let _a_ be the solid body\r\nand _c_ the light;

WHY BODIES IN LIGHT AND SHADE HAVE THEIR OUTLINES ALTERED BY THE\r\nCOLOUR AND BRIGHTNESS OF THE OBJECTS SERVING AS A BACKGROUND TO\r\nTHEM. If you look at a body of which the illuminated portion lies and ends\r\nagainst a dark background, that part of the light which will look\r\nbrightest will be that which lies against the dark [background] at\r\n_d_. But if this brighter part lies against a light background, the\r\nedge of the object, which is itself light, will be less distinct\r\nthan before, and the highest light will appear to be between the\r\nlimit of the background _m f_ and the shadow. The same thing is seen\r\nwith regard to the dark [side], inasmuch as that edge of the shaded\r\nportion of the object which lies against a light background, as at\r\n_l_, it looks much darker than the rest. But if this shadow lies\r\nagainst a dark background, the edge of the shaded part will appear\r\nlighter than before, and the deepest shade will appear between the\r\nedge and the light at the point _o_. [Footnote: In the original diagram _o_ is inside the shaded surface\r\nat the level of _d_.]\r\n\r\n246. An opaque body will appear smaller when it is surrounded by a highly\r\nluminous background, and a light body will appear larger when it is\r\nseen against a darker background. This may be seen in the height of\r\nbuildings at night, when lightning flashes behind them; it suddenly\r\nseems, when it lightens, as though the height of the building were\r\ndiminished. For the same reason such buildings look larger in a\r\nmist, or by night than when the atmosphere is clear and light. 247. ON LIGHT BETWEEN SHADOWS\r\n\r\nWhen you are drawing any object, remember, in comparing the grades\r\nof light in the illuminated portions, that the eye is often deceived\r\nby seeing things lighter than they are. And the reason lies in our\r\ncomparing those parts with the contiguous parts. Since if two\r\n[separate] parts are in different grades of light and if the less\r\nbright is conterminous with a dark portion and the brighter is\r\nconterminous with a light background--as the sky or something\r\nequally bright--, then that which is less light, or I should say\r\nless radiant, will look the brighter and the brighter will seem the\r\ndarker. 248. Of objects equally dark in themselves and situated at a considerable\r\nand equal distance, that will look the darkest which is farthest\r\nabove the earth. 249. TO PROVE HOW IT IS THAT LUMINOUS BODIES APPEAR LARGER, AT A\r\nDISTANCE, THAN THEY ARE. If you place two lighted candles side by side half a braccio apart,\r\nand go from them to a distance 200 braccia you will see that by the\r\nincreased size of each they will appear as a single luminous body\r\nwith the light of the two flames, one braccio wide. TO PROVE HOW YOU MAY SEE THE REAL SIZE OF LUMINOUS BODIES. If you wish to see the real size of these luminous bodies, take a\r\nvery thin board and make in it a hole no bigger than the tag of a\r\nlace and place it as close to your eye as possible, so that when you\r\nlook through this hole, at the said light, you can see a large space\r\nof air round it. Then by rapidly moving this board backwards and\r\nforwards before your eye you will see the light increase [and\r\ndiminish]. Propositions on perspective of disappearance from MS. C.

OF PAINTING. The hue of an illuminated object is affected by that of the luminous\r\nbody. 264. OF SHADOW. The surface of any opaque body is affected by the colour of\r\nsurrounding objects. 265. A shadow is always affected by the colour of the surface on which it\r\nis cast. 266. An image produced in a mirror is affected by the colour of the\r\nmirror. 267. OF LIGHT AND SHADE. Every portion of the surface of a body is varied [in hue] by the\r\n[reflected] colour of the object that may be opposite to it. EXAMPLE. If you place a spherical body between various objects that is to say\r\nwith [direct] sunlight on one side of it, and on the other a wall\r\nilluminated by the sun, which wall may be green or of any other\r\ncolour, while the surface on which it is placed may be red, and the\r\ntwo lateral sides are in shadow, you will see that the natural\r\ncolour of that body will assume something of the hue reflected from\r\nthose objects. The strongest will be [given by] the luminous body;\r\nthe second by the illuminated wall, the third by the shadows. There\r\nwill still be a portion which will take a tint from the colour of\r\nthe edges. 268. The surface of every opaque body is affected by the colour of the\r\nobjects surrounding it. But this effect will be strong or weak in\r\nproportion as those objects are more or less remote and more or less\r\nstrongly [coloured]. 269. OF PAINTING. The surface of every opaque body assumes the hues reflected from\r\nsurrounding objects. The surface of an opaque body assumes the hues of surrounding\r\nobjects more strongly in proportion as the rays that form the images\r\nof those objects strike the surface at more equal angles. And the surface of an opaque body assumes a stronger hue from the\r\nsurrounding objects in proportion as that surface is whiter and the\r\ncolour of the object brighter or more highly illuminated. 270. OF THE RAYS WHICH CONVEY THROUGH THE AIR THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS. All the minutest parts of the image intersect each other without\r\ninterfering with each other. To prove this let _r_ be one of the\r\nsides of the hole, opposite to which let _s_ be the eye which sees\r\nthe lower end _o_ of the line _n o_. The other extremity cannot\r\ntransmit its image to the eye _s_ as it has to strike the end _r_\r\nand it is the same with regard to _m_ at the middle of the line. The\r\ncase is the same with the upper extremity _n_ and the eye _u_.

OF THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE IMAGES IN THE PUPIL OF THE EYE. The intersections of the images as they enter the pupil do not\r\nmingle in confusion in the space where that intersection unites\r\nthem; as is evident, since, if the rays of the sun pass through two\r\npanes of glass in close contact, of which one is blue and the other\r\nyellow, the rays, in penetrating them, do not become blue or yellow\r\nbut a beautiful green.

ANY SHADOW CAST BY AN OPAQUE BODY SMALLER THAN THE LIGHT CAUSING THE\r\nSHADOW WILL THROW A DERIVED SHADOW WHICH IS TINGED BY THE COLOUR OF\r\nTHE LIGHT. Let _n_ be the source of the shadow _e f_; it will assume its hue.

The third grade of shadow is _h e_, where two thirds\r\nof the light from the window is visible. The last grade of shadow is\r\n_b d e f_, because the highest grade of light from the window falls\r\nat _f_. [Footnote: The diagram Pl. III, No. 1 belongs to this chapter as\r\nwell as the text given in No. 148.

OF THE COLOURS OF SIMPLE DERIVED SHADOWS. The colour of derived shadows is always affected by that of the body\r\ntowards which they are cast. To prove this: let an opaque body be\r\nplaced between the plane _s c t d_ and the blue light _d e_ and the\r\nred light _a b_, then I say that _d e_, the blue light, will fall on\r\nthe whole surface _s c t d_ excepting at _o p_ which is covered by\r\nthe shadow of the body _q r_, as is shown by the straight lines _d q\r\no e r p_. And the same occurs with the light _a b_ which falls on\r\nthe whole surface _s c t d_ excepting at the spot obscured by the\r\nshadow _q r_; as is shown by the lines _d q o_, and _e r p_. Hence\r\nwe may conclude that the shadow _n m_ is exposed to the blue light\r\n_d e_; but, as the red light _a b_ cannot fall there, _n m_ will\r\nappear as a blue shadow on a red background tinted with blue,\r\nbecause on the surface _s c t d_ both lights can fall. But in the\r\nshadows only one single light falls; for this reason these shadows\r\nare of medium depth, since, if no light whatever mingled with the\r\nshadow, it would be of the first degree of darkness &c. But in the\r\nshadow at _o p_ the blue light does not fall, because the body _q r_\r\ninterposes and intercepts it there. Only the red light _a b_ falls\r\nthere and tinges the shadow of a red hue and so a ruddy shadow\r\nappears on the background of mingled red and blue. The shadow of _q r_ at _o p_ is red, being caused by the blue light\r\n_d e_; and the shadow of _q r_ at _o' p'_ is blue being caused by\r\nthe red light _a b_. Hence we say that the blue light in this\r\ninstance causes a red derived shadow from the opaque body _q' r'_,\r\nwhile the red light causes the same body to cast a blue derived\r\nshadow; but the primary shadow [on the dark side of the body itself]\r\nis not of either of those hues, but a mixture of red and blue. The derived shadows will be equal in depth if they are produced by\r\nlights of equal strength and at an equal distance; this is proved.", "sentences": ["And this is proved by the 4th\r\n[proposition], on the colour of bodies, which says: The surface of\r\nevery opaque body is affected by the colour of surrounding objects;\r\nhence we may conclude that the spot which, by means of the rays\r\nwhich convey the image, faces--and is faced by the cause of the\r\nimage, assumes the colour of that object.", "On the colours of derived shadows (275.", "276).", "275.", "ANY SHADOW CAST BY AN OPAQUE BODY SMALLER THAN THE LIGHT CAUSING THE\r\nSHADOW WILL THROW A DERIVED SHADOW WHICH IS TINGED BY THE COLOUR OF\r\nTHE LIGHT.", "Let _n_ be the source of the shadow _e f_; it will assume its hue.", "Let _o_ be the source of _h e_ which will in the same way be tinged\r\nby its hue and so also the colour of _v h_ will be affected by _p_\r\nwhich causes it; and the shadow of the triangle _z k y_ will be\r\naffected by the colour of _q_, because it is produced by it.", "[7] In\r\nproportion as _c d_ goes into _a d_, will _n r s_ be darker than\r\n_m_; and the rest of the space will be shadowless [11].", "_f g_ is\r\nthe highest light, because here the whole light of the window _a d_\r\nfalls; and thus on the opaque body _m e_ is in equally high light;\r\n_z k y_ is a triangle which includes the deepest shadow, because the\r\nlight _a d_ cannot reach any part of it.", "_x h_ is the 2nd grade of\r\nshadow, because it receives only 1/3 of the light from the window,\r\nthat is _c d_.", "The third grade of shadow is _h e_, where two thirds\r\nof the light from the window is visible.", "The last grade of shadow is\r\n_b d e f_, because the highest grade of light from the window falls\r\nat _f_.", "[Footnote: The diagram Pl.", "III, No.", "1 belongs to this chapter as\r\nwell as the text given in No.", "148.", "Lines 7-11 (compare lines 8-12 of\r\nNo.", "148) which are written within the diagram, evidently apply to\r\nboth sections and have therefore been inserted in both.]\r\n\r\n276.", "OF THE COLOURS OF SIMPLE DERIVED SHADOWS.", "The colour of derived shadows is always affected by that of the body\r\ntowards which they are cast.", "To prove this: let an opaque body be\r\nplaced between the plane _s c t d_ and the blue light _d e_ and the\r\nred light _a b_, then I say that _d e_, the blue light, will fall on\r\nthe whole surface _s c t d_ excepting at _o p_ which is covered by\r\nthe shadow of the body _q r_, as is shown by the straight lines _d q\r\no e r p_.", "And the same occurs with the light _a b_ which falls on\r\nthe whole surface _s c t d_ excepting at the spot obscured by the\r\nshadow _q r_; as is shown by the lines _d q o_, and _e r p_.", "Hence\r\nwe may conclude that the shadow _n m_ is exposed to the blue light\r\n_d e_; but, as the red light _a b_ cannot fall there, _n m_ will\r\nappear as a blue shadow on a red background tinted with blue,\r\nbecause on the surface _s c t d_ both lights can fall.", "But in the\r\nshadows only one single light falls; for this reason these shadows\r\nare of medium depth, since, if no light whatever mingled with the\r\nshadow, it would be of the first degree of darkness &c.", "But in the\r\nshadow at _o p_ the blue light does not fall, because the body _q r_\r\ninterposes and intercepts it there.", "Only the red light _a b_ falls\r\nthere and tinges the shadow of a red hue and so a ruddy shadow\r\nappears on the background of mingled red and blue.", "The shadow of _q r_ at _o p_ is red, being caused by the blue light\r\n_d e_; and the shadow of _q r_ at _o' p'_ is blue being caused by\r\nthe red light _a b_.", "Hence we say that the blue light in this\r\ninstance causes a red derived shadow from the opaque body _q' r'_,\r\nwhile the red light causes the same body to cast a blue derived\r\nshadow; but the primary shadow [on the dark side of the body itself]\r\nis not of either of those hues, but a mixture of red and blue.", "The derived shadows will be equal in depth if they are produced by\r\nlights of equal strength and at an equal distance; this is proved."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_62", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 62)", "language": "it", "content": "[Footnote 53: The text is unfinished in the original.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: In the original diagram Leonardo has written within the\r\ncircle _q r corpo obroso_ (body in shadow); at the spot marked _A,\r\nluminoso azzurro_ (blue luminous body); at _B, luminoso rosso_ (red\r\nluminous body).

OF PAINTING. [Footnote 2: See Footnote 3] Since white is not a colour but the\r\nneutral recipient of every colour [Footnote 3: _il bianco non e\r\ncolore ma e inpotentia ricettiva d'ogni colore_ (white is not a\r\ncolour, but the neutral recipient of every colour). LEON BATT. ALBERTI \"_Della pittura_\" libro I, asserts on the contrary: \"_Il\r\nbianco e'l nero non sono veri colori, ma sono alteratione delli\r\naltri colori_\" (ed. JANITSCHEK, p. 67; Vienna 1877).], when it is\r\nseen in the open air and high up, all its shadows are bluish; and\r\nthis is caused, according to the 4th [prop.], which says: the\r\nsurface of every opaque body assumes the hue of the surrounding\r\nobjects. Now this white [body] being deprived of the light of the\r\nsun by the interposition of some body between the sun and itself,\r\nall that portion of it which is exposed to the sun and atmosphere\r\nassumes the colour of the sun and atmosphere; the side on which the\r\nsun does not fall remains in shadow and assumes the hue of the\r\natmosphere. And if this white object did not reflect the green of\r\nthe fields all the way to the horizon nor get the brightness of the\r\nhorizon itself, it would certainly appear simply of the same hue as\r\nthe atmosphere. On gradations in the depth of colours (279. 280). 279. Since black, when painted next to white, looks no blacker than when\r\nnext to black; and white when next to black looks no whiter than\r\nwhite, as is seen by the images transmitted through a small hole or\r\nby the edges of any opaque screen ... 280. OF COLOURS. Of several colours, all equally white, that will look whitest which\r\nis against the darkest background. And black will look intensest\r\nagainst the whitest background. And red will look most vivid against the yellowest background; and\r\nthe same is the case with all colours when surrounded by their\r\nstrongest contrasts. On the reflection of colours (281-283). 281. PERSPECTIVE. Every object devoid of colour in itself is more or less tinged by\r\nthe colour [of the object] placed opposite. This may be seen by\r\nexperience, inasmuch as any object which mirrors another assumes the\r\ncolour of the object mirrored in it. And if the surface thus\r\npartially coloured is white the portion which has a red reflection\r\nwill appear red, or any other colour, whether bright or dark. PERSPECTIVE. Every opaque and colourless body assumes the hue of the colour\r\nreflected on it; as happens with a white wall. 282. PERSPECTIVE. That side of an object in light and shade which is towards the light\r\ntransmits the images of its details more distinctly and immediately\r\nto the eye than the side which is in shadow. PERSPECTIVE. The solar rays reflected on a square mirror will be thrown back to\r\ndistant objects in a circular form. PERSPECTIVE. Any white and opaque surface will be partially coloured by\r\nreflections from surrounding objects.

On the use of dark and light colours in painting (284--286). 284. WHY BEAUTIFUL COLOURS MUST BE IN THE [HIGHEST] LIGHT. Since we see that the quality of colour is known [only] by means of\r\nlight, it is to be supposed that where there is most light the true\r\ncharacter of a colour in light will be best seen; and where there is\r\nmost shadow the colour will be affected by the tone of that. Hence,\r\nO Painter! remember to show the true quality of colours in bright\r\nlights. 285. An object represented in white and black will display stronger\r\nrelief than in any other way; hence I would remind you O Painter! to\r\ndress your figures in the lightest colours you can, since, if you\r\nput them in dark colours, they will be in too slight relief and\r\ninconspicuous from a distance. And the reason is that the shadows of\r\nall objects are dark. And if you make a dress dark there is little\r\nvariety in the lights and shadows, while in light colours there are\r\nmany grades. 286. OF PAINTING. Colours seen in shadow will display more or less of their natural\r\nbrilliancy in proportion as they are in fainter or deeper shadow. But if these same colours are situated in a well-lighted place, they\r\nwill appear brighter in proportion as the light is more brilliant. THE ADVERSARY. The variety of colours in shadow must be as great as that of the\r\ncolours in the objects in that shadow. THE ANSWER. Colours seen in shadow will display less variety in proportion as\r\nthe shadows in which they lie are deeper. And evidence of this is to\r\nbe had by looking from an open space into the doorways of dark and\r\nshadowy churches, where the pictures which are painted in various\r\ncolours all look of uniform darkness. Hence at a considerable distance all the shadows of different\r\ncolours will appear of the same darkness. It is the light side of an object in light and shade which shows the\r\ntrue colour. On the colours of the rainbow (287. 288). 287. Treat of the rainbow in the last book on Painting, but first write\r\nthe book on colours produced by the mixture of other colours, so as\r\nto be able to prove by those painters' colours how the colours of\r\nthe rainbow are produced. 288. WHETHER THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW ARE PRODUCED BY THE SUN. The colours of the rainbow are not produced by the sun, for they\r\noccur in many ways without the sunshine; as may be seen by holding a\r\nglass of water up to the eye; when, in the glass--where there are\r\nthose minute bubbles always seen in coarse glass--each bubble, even\r\nthough the sun does not fall on it, will produce on one side all the\r\ncolours of the rainbow; as you may see by placing the glass between\r\nthe day light and your eye in such a way as that it is close to the\r\neye, while on one side the glass admits the [diffused] light of the\r\natmosphere, and on the other side the shadow of the wall on one side\r\nof the window; either left or right, it matters not which. Then, by\r\nturning the glass round you will see these colours all round the\r\nbubbles in the glass &c. And the rest shall be said in its place. THAT THE EYE HAS NO PART IN PRODUCING THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW. In the experiment just described, the eye would seem to have some\r\nshare in the colours of the rainbow, since these bubbles in the\r\nglass do not display the colours except through the medium of the\r\neye.", "sentences": ["If _a_ is the light, and _b_ illuminated by it in a direct line,\r\n_c_, on which the light cannot fall, is lighted only by reflection\r\nfrom _b_ which, let us say, is red.", "Hence the light reflected from\r\nit, will be affected by the hue of the surface causing it and will\r\ntinge the surface _c_ with red.", "And if _c_ is also red you will see\r\nit much more intense than _b_; and if it were yellow you would see\r\nthere a colour between yellow and red.", "On the use of dark and light colours in painting (284--286).", "284.", "WHY BEAUTIFUL COLOURS MUST BE IN THE [HIGHEST] LIGHT.", "Since we see that the quality of colour is known [only] by means of\r\nlight, it is to be supposed that where there is most light the true\r\ncharacter of a colour in light will be best seen; and where there is\r\nmost shadow the colour will be affected by the tone of that.", "Hence,\r\nO Painter!", "remember to show the true quality of colours in bright\r\nlights.", "285.", "An object represented in white and black will display stronger\r\nrelief than in any other way; hence I would remind you O Painter!", "to\r\ndress your figures in the lightest colours you can, since, if you\r\nput them in dark colours, they will be in too slight relief and\r\ninconspicuous from a distance.", "And the reason is that the shadows of\r\nall objects are dark.", "And if you make a dress dark there is little\r\nvariety in the lights and shadows, while in light colours there are\r\nmany grades.", "286.", "OF PAINTING.", "Colours seen in shadow will display more or less of their natural\r\nbrilliancy in proportion as they are in fainter or deeper shadow.", "But if these same colours are situated in a well-lighted place, they\r\nwill appear brighter in proportion as the light is more brilliant.", "THE ADVERSARY.", "The variety of colours in shadow must be as great as that of the\r\ncolours in the objects in that shadow.", "THE ANSWER.", "Colours seen in shadow will display less variety in proportion as\r\nthe shadows in which they lie are deeper.", "And evidence of this is to\r\nbe had by looking from an open space into the doorways of dark and\r\nshadowy churches, where the pictures which are painted in various\r\ncolours all look of uniform darkness.", "Hence at a considerable distance all the shadows of different\r\ncolours will appear of the same darkness.", "It is the light side of an object in light and shade which shows the\r\ntrue colour.", "On the colours of the rainbow (287.", "288).", "287.", "Treat of the rainbow in the last book on Painting, but first write\r\nthe book on colours produced by the mixture of other colours, so as\r\nto be able to prove by those painters' colours how the colours of\r\nthe rainbow are produced.", "288.", "WHETHER THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW ARE PRODUCED BY THE SUN.", "The colours of the rainbow are not produced by the sun, for they\r\noccur in many ways without the sunshine; as may be seen by holding a\r\nglass of water up to the eye; when, in the glass--where there are\r\nthose minute bubbles always seen in coarse glass--each bubble, even\r\nthough the sun does not fall on it, will produce on one side all the\r\ncolours of the rainbow; as you may see by placing the glass between\r\nthe day light and your eye in such a way as that it is close to the\r\neye, while on one side the glass admits the [diffused] light of the\r\natmosphere, and on the other side the shadow of the wall on one side\r\nof the window; either left or right, it matters not which.", "Then, by\r\nturning the glass round you will see these colours all round the\r\nbubbles in the glass &c.", "And the rest shall be said in its place.", "THAT THE EYE HAS NO PART IN PRODUCING THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW.", "In the experiment just described, the eye would seem to have some\r\nshare in the colours of the rainbow, since these bubbles in the\r\nglass do not display the colours except through the medium of the\r\neye."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_64", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 64)", "language": "it", "content": "But, if you place the glass full of water on the window sill,\r\nin such a position as that the outer side is exposed to the sun's\r\nrays, you will see the same colours produced in the spot of light\r\nthrown through the glass and upon the floor, in a dark place, below\r\nthe window; and as the eye is not here concerned in it, we may\r\nevidently, and with certainty pronounce that the eye has no share in\r\nproducing them. OF THE COLOURS IN THE FEATHERS OF CERTAIN BIRDS. There are many birds in various regions of the world on whose\r\nfeathers we see the most splendid colours produced as they move, as\r\nwe see in our own country in the feathers of peacocks or on the\r\nnecks of ducks or pigeons, &c. Again, on the surface of antique glass found underground and on the\r\nroots of turnips kept for some time at the bottom of wells or other\r\nstagnant waters [we see] that each root displays colours similar to\r\nthose of the real rainbow.

Indeed the\r\nauthor enters into it so fully that we cannot escape the conviction\r\nthat he must have dwelt with particular pleasure on this part of his\r\nsubject, and that he attached great importance to giving it a\r\ncharacter of general applicability._\r\n\r\nGeneral rules (289--291). 289. The variety of colour in objects cannot be discerned at a great\r\ndistance, excepting in those parts which are directly lighted up by\r\nthe solar rays. 290. As to the colours of objects: at long distances no difference is\r\nperceptible in the parts in shadow. 291. OF THE VISIBILITY OF COLOURS. Which colour strikes most? An object at a distance is most\r\nconspicuous, when it is lightest, and the darkest is least visible. An exceptional case. 292. Of the edges [outlines] of shadows. Some have misty and ill defined\r\nedges, others distinct ones. No opaque body can be devoid of light and shade, except it is in a\r\nmist, on ground covered with snow, or when snow is falling on the\r\nopen country which has no light on it and is surrounded with\r\ndarkness. And this occurs [only] in spherical bodies, because in other bodies\r\nwhich have limbs and parts, those sides of limbs which face each\r\nother reflect on each other the accidental [hue and tone] of their\r\nsurface. An experiment. 293. ALL COLOURS ARE AT A DISTANCE UNDISTINGUISHABLE AND UNDISCERNIBLE. All colours at a distance are undistinguishable in shadow, because\r\nan object which is not in the highest light is incapable of\r\ntransmitting its image to the eye through an atmosphere more\r\nluminous than itself; since the lesser brightness must be absorbed\r\nby the greater. For instance: We, in a house, can see that all the\r\ncolours on the surface of the walls are clearly and instantly\r\nvisible when the windows of the house are open; but if we were to go\r\nout of the house and look in at the windows from a little distance\r\nto see the paintings on those walls, instead of the paintings we\r\nshould see an uniform deep and colourless shadow.", "sentences": ["But, if you place the glass full of water on the window sill,\r\nin such a position as that the outer side is exposed to the sun's\r\nrays, you will see the same colours produced in the spot of light\r\nthrown through the glass and upon the floor, in a dark place, below\r\nthe window; and as the eye is not here concerned in it, we may\r\nevidently, and with certainty pronounce that the eye has no share in\r\nproducing them.", "OF THE COLOURS IN THE FEATHERS OF CERTAIN BIRDS.", "There are many birds in various regions of the world on whose\r\nfeathers we see the most splendid colours produced as they move, as\r\nwe see in our own country in the feathers of peacocks or on the\r\nnecks of ducks or pigeons, &c.", "Again, on the surface of antique glass found underground and on the\r\nroots of turnips kept for some time at the bottom of wells or other\r\nstagnant waters [we see] that each root displays colours similar to\r\nthose of the real rainbow.", "They may also be seen when oil has been\r\nplaced on the top of water and in the solar rays reflected from the\r\nsurface of a diamond or beryl; again, through the angular facet of a\r\nberyl every dark object against a background of the atmosphere or\r\nany thing else equally pale-coloured is surrounded by these rainbow\r\ncolours between the atmosphere and the dark body; and in many other\r\ncircumstances which I will not mention, as these suffice for my\r\npurpose.", "_VI._\r\n\r\n_'Prospettiva de' colri' (Perspective of Colour)_\r\n\r\n_and_\r\n\r\n_'Prospettiva aerea' (Aerial Perspective)._\r\n\r\n_Leonardo distinctly separates these branches of his subject, as may\r\nbe seen in the beginning of No._ 295.", "_Attempts have been made to\r\ncast doubts on the results which Leonardo arrived at by experiment\r\non the perspective of colour, but not with justice, as may be seen\r\nfrom the original text of section_ 294.", "_The question as to the composition of the atmosphere, which is\r\ninseparable from a discussion on Aerial Perspective, forms a\r\nseparate theory which is treated at considerable length.", "Indeed the\r\nauthor enters into it so fully that we cannot escape the conviction\r\nthat he must have dwelt with particular pleasure on this part of his\r\nsubject, and that he attached great importance to giving it a\r\ncharacter of general applicability._\r\n\r\nGeneral rules (289--291).", "289.", "The variety of colour in objects cannot be discerned at a great\r\ndistance, excepting in those parts which are directly lighted up by\r\nthe solar rays.", "290.", "As to the colours of objects: at long distances no difference is\r\nperceptible in the parts in shadow.", "291.", "OF THE VISIBILITY OF COLOURS.", "Which colour strikes most?", "An object at a distance is most\r\nconspicuous, when it is lightest, and the darkest is least visible.", "An exceptional case.", "292.", "Of the edges [outlines] of shadows.", "Some have misty and ill defined\r\nedges, others distinct ones.", "No opaque body can be devoid of light and shade, except it is in a\r\nmist, on ground covered with snow, or when snow is falling on the\r\nopen country which has no light on it and is surrounded with\r\ndarkness.", "And this occurs [only] in spherical bodies, because in other bodies\r\nwhich have limbs and parts, those sides of limbs which face each\r\nother reflect on each other the accidental [hue and tone] of their\r\nsurface.", "An experiment.", "293.", "ALL COLOURS ARE AT A DISTANCE UNDISTINGUISHABLE AND UNDISCERNIBLE.", "All colours at a distance are undistinguishable in shadow, because\r\nan object which is not in the highest light is incapable of\r\ntransmitting its image to the eye through an atmosphere more\r\nluminous than itself; since the lesser brightness must be absorbed\r\nby the greater.", "For instance: We, in a house, can see that all the\r\ncolours on the surface of the walls are clearly and instantly\r\nvisible when the windows of the house are open; but if we were to go\r\nout of the house and look in at the windows from a little distance\r\nto see the paintings on those walls, instead of the paintings we\r\nshould see an uniform deep and colourless shadow."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_65", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 65)", "language": "it", "content": "The practice of the prospettiva de colori. 294. HOW A PAINTER SHOULD CARRY OUT THE PERSPECTIVE OF COLOUR IN\r\nPRACTICE. In order to put into practice this perspective of the variation and\r\nloss or diminution of the essential character of colours, observe at\r\nevery hundred braccia some objects standing in the landscape, such\r\nas trees, houses, men and particular places. Then in front of the\r\nfirst tree have a very steady plate of glass and keep your eye very\r\nsteady, and then, on this plate of glass, draw a tree, tracing it\r\nover the form of that tree. Then move it on one side so far as that\r\nthe real tree is close by the side of the tree you have drawn; then\r\ncolour your drawing in such a way as that in colour and form the two\r\nmay be alike, and that both, if you close one eye, seem to be\r\npainted on the glass and at the same distance. Then, by the same\r\nmethod, represent a second tree, and a third, with a distance of a\r\nhundred braccia between each. And these will serve as a standard and\r\nguide whenever you work on your own pictures, wherever they may\r\napply, and will enable you to give due distance in those works. [14]\r\nBut I have found that as a rule the second is 4/5 of the first when\r\nit is 20 braccia beyond it. [Footnote: This chapter is one of those copied in the Manuscript of\r\nthe Vatican library Urbinas 1270, and the original text is rendered\r\nhere with no other alterations, but in the orthography. H. LUDWIG,\r\nin his edition of this copy translates lines 14 and 15 thus: \"_Ich\r\nfinde aber als Regel, dass der zweite um vier Funftel des ersten\r\nabnimmt, wenn er namlich zwanzig Ellen vom ersten entfernt ist\r\n(?)\"_. He adds in his commentary: \"_Das Ende der Nummer ist wohl\r\njedenfalls verstummelt_\". However the translation given above shows\r\nthat it admits of a different rendering.]\r\n\r\nThe rules of aerial perspective (295--297). 295. OF AERIAL PERSPECTIVE. There is another kind of perspective which I call Aerial\r\nPerspective, because by the atmosphere we are able to distinguish\r\nthe variations in distance of different buildings, which appear\r\nplaced on a single line; as, for instance, when we see several\r\nbuildings beyond a wall, all of which, as they appear above the top\r\nof the wall, look of the same size, while you wish to represent them\r\nin a picture as more remote one than another and to give the effect\r\nof a somewhat dense atmosphere. You know that in an atmosphere of\r\nequal density the remotest objects seen through it, as mountains, in\r\nconsequence of the great quantity of atmosphere between your eye and\r\nthem--appear blue and almost of the same hue as the atmosphere\r\nitself [Footnote 10: _quado il sole e per leuante_ (when the sun is\r\nin the East). Apparently the author refers here to morning light in\r\ngeneral. H. LUDWIG however translates this passage from the Vatican\r\ncopy \"_wenn namlich die Sonne (dahinter) im Osten steht_\".] when the\r\nsun is in the East [Footnote 11: See Footnote 10]. Hence you must\r\nmake the nearest building above the wall of its real colour, but the\r\nmore distant ones make less defined and bluer. Those you wish should\r\nlook farthest away you must make proportionately bluer; thus, if one\r\nis to be five times as distant, make it five times bluer.

On the relative density of the atmosphere (298--290). 298. WHY THE ATMOSPHERE MUST BE REPRESENTED AS PALER TOWARDS THE LOWER\r\nPORTION. Because the atmosphere is dense near the earth, and the higher it is\r\nthe rarer it becomes. When the sun is in the East if you look\r\ntowards the West and a little way to the South and North, you will\r\nsee that this dense atmosphere receives more light from the sun than\r\nthe rarer; because the rays meet with greater resistance. And if the\r\nsky, as you see it, ends on a low plain, that lowest portion of the\r\nsky will be seen through a denser and whiter atmosphere, which will\r\nweaken its true colour as seen through that medium, and there the\r\nsky will look whiter than it is above you, where the line of sight\r\ntravels through a smaller space of air charged with heavy vapour. And if you turn to the East, the atmosphere will appear darker as\r\nyou look lower down because the luminous rays pass less freely\r\nthrough the lower atmosphere. 299. OF THE MODE OF TREATING REMOTE OBJECTS IN PAINTING. It is easy to perceive that the atmosphere which lies closest to the\r\nlevel ground is denser than the rest, and that where it is higher\r\nup, it is rarer and more transparent. The lower portions of large\r\nand lofty objects which are at a distance are not much seen, because\r\nyou see them along a line which passes through a denser and thicker\r\nsection of the atmosphere. The summits of such heights are seen\r\nalong a line which, though it starts from your eye in a dense\r\natmosphere, still, as it ends at the top of those lofty objects,\r\nceases in a much rarer atmosphere than exists at their base; for\r\nthis reason the farther this line extends from your eye, from point\r\nto point the atmosphere becomes more and more rare. Hence, O\r\nPainter! when you represent mountains, see that from hill to hill\r\nthe bases are paler than the summits, and in proportion as they\r\nrecede beyond each other make the bases paler than the summits;\r\nwhile, the higher they are the more you must show of their true form\r\nand colour. On the colour of the atmosphere (300-307). 300. OF THE COLOUR OF THE ATMOSPHERE. I say that the blueness we see in the atmosphere is not intrinsic\r\ncolour, but is caused by warm vapour evaporated in minute and\r\ninsensible atoms on which the solar rays fall, rendering them\r\nluminous against the infinite darkness of the fiery sphere which\r\nlies beyond and includes it. And this may be seen, as I saw it by\r\nany one going up [Footnote 5: With regard to the place spoken of as\r\n_M'oboso_ (compare No. 301 line 20) its identity will be discussed\r\nunder Leonardo's Topographical notes in Vol. II.] Monboso, a peak of\r\nthe Alps which divide France from Italy. The base of this mountain\r\ngives birth to the four rivers which flow in four different\r\ndirections through the whole of Europe. And no mountain has its base\r\nat so great a height as this, which lifts itself almost above the\r\nclouds; and snow seldom falls there, but only hail in the summer,\r\nwhen the clouds are highest. And this hail lies [unmelted] there, so\r\nthat if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling\r\nclouds, which does not happen twice in an age, an enormous mass of\r\nice would be piled up there by the hail, and in the middle of July I\r\nfound it very considerable. There I saw above me the dark sky, and\r\nthe sun as it fell on the mountain was far brighter here than in the\r\nplains below, because a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the\r\nsummit of the mountain and the sun. Again as an illustration of the\r\ncolour of the atmosphere I will mention the smoke of old and dry\r\nwood, which, as it comes out of a chimney, appears to turn very\r\nblue, when seen between the eye and the dark distance.", "sentences": ["Take care that the perspective of colour does not disagree with the\r\nsize of your objects, hat is to say: that the colours diminish from\r\ntheir natural [vividness] in proportion as the objects at various\r\ndistances dimmish from their natural size.", "On the relative density of the atmosphere (298--290).", "298.", "WHY THE ATMOSPHERE MUST BE REPRESENTED AS PALER TOWARDS THE LOWER\r\nPORTION.", "Because the atmosphere is dense near the earth, and the higher it is\r\nthe rarer it becomes.", "When the sun is in the East if you look\r\ntowards the West and a little way to the South and North, you will\r\nsee that this dense atmosphere receives more light from the sun than\r\nthe rarer; because the rays meet with greater resistance.", "And if the\r\nsky, as you see it, ends on a low plain, that lowest portion of the\r\nsky will be seen through a denser and whiter atmosphere, which will\r\nweaken its true colour as seen through that medium, and there the\r\nsky will look whiter than it is above you, where the line of sight\r\ntravels through a smaller space of air charged with heavy vapour.", "And if you turn to the East, the atmosphere will appear darker as\r\nyou look lower down because the luminous rays pass less freely\r\nthrough the lower atmosphere.", "299.", "OF THE MODE OF TREATING REMOTE OBJECTS IN PAINTING.", "It is easy to perceive that the atmosphere which lies closest to the\r\nlevel ground is denser than the rest, and that where it is higher\r\nup, it is rarer and more transparent.", "The lower portions of large\r\nand lofty objects which are at a distance are not much seen, because\r\nyou see them along a line which passes through a denser and thicker\r\nsection of the atmosphere.", "The summits of such heights are seen\r\nalong a line which, though it starts from your eye in a dense\r\natmosphere, still, as it ends at the top of those lofty objects,\r\nceases in a much rarer atmosphere than exists at their base; for\r\nthis reason the farther this line extends from your eye, from point\r\nto point the atmosphere becomes more and more rare.", "Hence, O\r\nPainter!", "when you represent mountains, see that from hill to hill\r\nthe bases are paler than the summits, and in proportion as they\r\nrecede beyond each other make the bases paler than the summits;\r\nwhile, the higher they are the more you must show of their true form\r\nand colour.", "On the colour of the atmosphere (300-307).", "300.", "OF THE COLOUR OF THE ATMOSPHERE.", "I say that the blueness we see in the atmosphere is not intrinsic\r\ncolour, but is caused by warm vapour evaporated in minute and\r\ninsensible atoms on which the solar rays fall, rendering them\r\nluminous against the infinite darkness of the fiery sphere which\r\nlies beyond and includes it.", "And this may be seen, as I saw it by\r\nany one going up [Footnote 5: With regard to the place spoken of as\r\n_M'oboso_ (compare No.", "301 line 20) its identity will be discussed\r\nunder Leonardo's Topographical notes in Vol.", "II.] Monboso, a peak of\r\nthe Alps which divide France from Italy.", "The base of this mountain\r\ngives birth to the four rivers which flow in four different\r\ndirections through the whole of Europe.", "And no mountain has its base\r\nat so great a height as this, which lifts itself almost above the\r\nclouds; and snow seldom falls there, but only hail in the summer,\r\nwhen the clouds are highest.", "And this hail lies [unmelted] there, so\r\nthat if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling\r\nclouds, which does not happen twice in an age, an enormous mass of\r\nice would be piled up there by the hail, and in the middle of July I\r\nfound it very considerable.", "There I saw above me the dark sky, and\r\nthe sun as it fell on the mountain was far brighter here than in the\r\nplains below, because a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the\r\nsummit of the mountain and the sun.", "Again as an illustration of the\r\ncolour of the atmosphere I will mention the smoke of old and dry\r\nwood, which, as it comes out of a chimney, appears to turn very\r\nblue, when seen between the eye and the dark distance."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_67", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 67)", "language": "it", "content": "But as it\r\nrises, and comes between the eye and the bright atmosphere, it at\r\nonce shows of an ashy grey colour; and this happens because it no\r\nlonger has darkness beyond it, but this bright and luminous space. If the smoke is from young, green wood, it will not appear blue,\r\nbecause, not being transparent and being full of superabundant\r\nmoisture, it has the effect of condensed clouds which take distinct\r\nlights and shadows like a solid body. The same occurs with the\r\natmosphere, which, when overcharged with moisture appears white, and\r\nthe small amount of heated moisture makes it dark, of a dark blue\r\ncolour; and this will suffice us so far as concerns the colour of\r\nthe atmosphere; though it might be added that, if this transparent\r\nblue were the natural colour of the atmosphere, it would follow that\r\nwherever a larger mass air intervened between the eye and the\r\nelement of fire, the azure colour would be more intense; as we see\r\nin blue glass and in sapphires, which are darker in proportion as\r\nthey are larger. But the atmosphere in such circumstances behaves in\r\nan opposite manner, inasmuch as where a greater quantity of it lies\r\nbetween the eye and the sphere of fire, it is seen much whiter. This\r\noccurs towards the horizon. And the less the extent of atmosphere\r\nbetween the eye and the sphere of fire, the deeper is the blue\r\ncolour, as may be seen even on low plains. Hence it follows, as I\r\nsay, that the atmosphere assumes this azure hue by reason of the\r\nparticles of moisture which catch the rays of the sun. Again, we may\r\nnote the difference in particles of dust, or particles of smoke, in\r\nthe sun beams admitted through holes into a dark chamber, when the\r\nformer will look ash grey and the thin smoke will appear of a most\r\nbeautiful blue; and it may be seen again in in the dark shadows of\r\ndistant mountains when the air between the eye and those shadows\r\nwill look very blue, though the brightest parts of those mountains\r\nwill not differ much from their true colour. But if any one wishes\r\nfor a final proof let him paint a board with various colours, among\r\nthem an intense black; and over all let him lay a very thin and\r\ntransparent [coating of] white. He will then see that this\r\ntransparent white will nowhere show a more beautiful blue than over\r\nthe black--but it must be very thin and finely ground. [Footnote 7: _reta_ here has the sense of _malanno_.]\r\n\r\n301. Experience shows us that the air must have darkness beyond it and\r\nyet it appears blue. If you produce a small quantity of smoke from\r\ndry wood and the rays of the sun fall on this smoke, and if you then\r\nplace behind the smoke a piece of black velvet on which the sun does\r\nnot shine, you will see that all the smoke which is between the eye\r\nand the black stuff will appear of a beautiful blue colour. And if\r\ninstead of the velvet you place a white cloth smoke, that is too\r\nthick smoke, hinders, and too thin smoke does not produce, the\r\nperfection of this blue colour. Hence a moderate amount of smoke\r\nproduces the finest blue. Water violently ejected in a fine spray\r\nand in a dark chamber where the sun beams are admitted produces\r\nthese blue rays and the more vividly if it is distilled water, and\r\nthin smoke looks blue. This I mention in order to show that the\r\nblueness of the atmosphere is caused by the darkness beyond it, and\r\nthese instances are given for those who cannot confirm my experience\r\non Monboso. 302. When the smoke from dry wood is seen between the eye of the\r\nspectator and some dark space [or object], it will look blue. Thus\r\nthe sky looks blue by reason of the darkness beyond it. And if you\r\nlook towards the horizon of the sky, you will see the atmosphere is\r\nnot blue, and this is caused by its density. And thus at each\r\ndegree, as you raise your eyes above the horizon up to the sky over\r\nyour head, you will see the atmosphere look darker [blue] and this\r\nis because a smaller density of air lies between your eye and the\r\n[outer] darkness.", "sentences": ["But as it\r\nrises, and comes between the eye and the bright atmosphere, it at\r\nonce shows of an ashy grey colour;

Darkness affects every thing with its hue, and the more an object\r\ndiffers from darkness, the more we see its real and natural colour. The mountains will look few, because only those will be seen which\r\nare farthest apart; since, at such a distance, the density increases\r\nto such a degree that it causes a brightness by which the darkness\r\nof the hills becomes divided and vanishes indeed towards the top.

Luca Paciolo\r\nwould seem to have had these MSS. (which I have distinguished by the\r\ninitials W. P.) in his mind when he wrote the passage quoted above. Still, certain notes of a later date--such as Nos. 360, 362 and 363,\r\nfrom MS.

Or else he took the subject up again at a\r\nsubsequent period, since his former researches had been carried on\r\nat Milan between 1490 and 1500. Indeed it is highly probable that\r\nthe anatomical studies which he was pursuing zvith so much zeal\r\nbetween 1510--16 should have led him to reconsider the subject of\r\nProportion.

If a man 2 braccia high is too small, one of four is too tall, the\r\nmedium being what is admirable. Between 2 and 4 comes 3; therefore\r\ntake a man of 3 braccia in height and measure him by the rule I will\r\ngive you. If you tell me that I may be mistaken, and judge a man to\r\nbe well proportioned who does not conform to this division, I answer\r\nthat you must look at many men of 3 braccia, and out of the larger\r\nnumber who are alike in their limbs choose one of those who are most\r\ngraceful and take your measurements.

The waist, or narrower part above the hips\r\nwill be half way between the arm pits and the bottom of the buttock. [Footnote: The lower sketch Pl.

Vitruvius, the architect, says in his work on architecture that the\r\nmeasurements of the human body are distributed by Nature as follows:\r\nthat is that 4 fingers make 1 palm, and 4 palms make 1 foot, 6 palms\r\nmake 1 cubit; 4 cubits make a man's height. And 4 cubits make one\r\npace and 24 palms make a man; and these measures he used in his\r\nbuildings. If you open your legs so much as to decrease your height\r\n1/14 and spread and raise your arms till your middle fingers touch\r\nthe level of the top of your head you must know that the centre of\r\nthe outspread limbs will be in the navel and the space between the\r\nlegs will be an equilateral triangle. The length of a man's outspread arms is equal to his height. From the roots of the hair to the bottom of the chin is the tenth of\r\na man's height; from the bottom of the chin to the top of his head\r\nis one eighth of his height; from the top of the breast to the top\r\nof his head will be one sixth of a man. From the top of the breast\r\nto the roots of the hair will be the seventh part of the whole man. From the nipples to the top of the head will be the fourth part of a\r\nman. The greatest width of the shoulders contains in itself the\r\nfourth part of the man. From the elbow to the tip of the hand will\r\nbe the fifth part of a man; and from the elbow to the angle of the\r\narmpit will be the eighth part of the man. The whole hand will be\r\nthe tenth part of the man; the beginning of the genitals marks the\r\nmiddle of the man. The foot is the seventh part of the man. From the\r\nsole of the foot to below the knee will be the fourth part of the\r\nman. From below the knee to the beginning of the genitals will be\r\nthe fourth part of the man. The distance from the bottom of the chin\r\nto the nose and from the roots of the hair to the eyebrows is, in\r\neach case the same, and like the ear, a third of the face. [Footnote: See Pl. XVIII.

The greatest thickness of the arm\r\nbetween the shoulder and the elbow goes 4 times into _c m_, and is\r\nequal to _h n g_. The smallest thickness of the arm above the elbow\r\n_x y_ is not the base of a square, but is equal to half the space\r\n_h_ 3 which is found between the inner joint of the arm and the\r\nwrist joint. [11]The width of the wrist goes 12 times into the whole arm; that is\r\nfrom the tip of the fingers to the shoulder joint; that is 3 times\r\ninto the hand and 9 into the arm. The arm when bent is 4 heads. The arm from the shoulder to the elbow in bending increases in\r\nlength, that is in the length from the shoulder to the elbow, and\r\nthis increase is equal to the thickness of the arm at the wrist when\r\nseen in profile. And the space between the bottom of the chin and\r\nthe parting of the lips, is equal to the thickness of the 2 middle\r\nfingers, and to the width of the mouth and to the space between the\r\nroots of the hair on the forehead and the top of the head [Footnote:\r\n_Queste cose_. This passage seems to have been written on purpose to\r\nrectify the foregoing lines. The error is explained by the\r\naccompanying sketch of the bones of the arm.]. All these distances\r\nare equal to each other, but they are not equal to the\r\nabove-mentioned increase in the arm. The arm between the elbow and wrist never increases by being bent or\r\nextended. The arm, from the shoulder to the inner joint when extended. When the arm is extended, _p n_ is equal to _n a_. And when it is\r\nbent _n a_ diminishes 1/6 of its length and _p n_ does the same. The\r\nouter elbow joint increases 1/7 when bent; and thus by being bent it\r\nincreases to the length of 2 heads. And on the inner side, by\r\nbending, it is found that whereas the arm from where it joins the\r\nside to the wrist, was 2 heads and a half, in bending it loses the\r\nhalf head and measures only two: one from the [shoulder] joint to\r\nthe end [by the elbow], and the other to the hand. The arm when folded will measure 2 faces up to the shoulder from the\r\nelbow and 2 from the elbow to the insertion of the four fingers on\r\nthe palm of the hand. The length from the base of the fingers to the\r\nelbow never alters in any position of the arm.

In the innermost bend of the joints of every limb the reliefs are\r\nconverted into a hollow, and likewise every hollow of the innermost\r\nbends becomes a convexity when the limb is straightened to the\r\nutmost. And in this very great mistakes are often made by those who\r\nhave insufficient knowledge and trust to their own invention and do\r\nnot have recourse to the imitation of nature; and these variations\r\noccur more in the middle of the sides than in front, and more at the\r\nback than at the sides. 351. When the arm is bent at an angle at the elbow, it will produce some\r\nangle; the more acute the angle is, the more will the muscles within\r\nthe bend be shortened; while the muscles outside will become of\r\ngreater length than before. As is shown in the example; _d c e_ will\r\nshrink considerably; and _b n_ will be much extended. [Footnote: See Pl. XIX, No. 2.]\r\n\r\n352. OF PAINTING. The arm, as it turns, thrusts back its shoulder towards the middle\r\nof the back. 353. The principal movements of the hand are 10; that is forwards,\r\nbackwards, to right and to left, in a circular motion, up or down,\r\nto close and to open, and to spread the fingers or to press them\r\ntogether. 354. OF THE MOTIONS OF THE FINGERS. The movements of the fingers principally consist in extending and\r\nbending them.

OF THE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS OF BOYS AND MEN. There is a great difference in the length between the joints in men\r\nand boys for, in man, from the top of the shoulder [by the neck] to\r\nthe elbow, and from the elbow to the tip of the thumb and from one\r\nshoulder to the other, is in each instance two heads, while in a boy\r\nit is but one because Nature constructs in us the mass which is the\r\nhome of the intellect, before forming that which contains the vital\r\nelements. 365. OF PAINTING. Which are the muscles which subdivide in old age or in youth, when\r\nbecoming lean? Which are the parts of the limbs of the human frame\r\nwhere no amount of fat makes the flesh thicker, nor any degree of\r\nleanness ever diminishes it? The thing sought for in this question will be found in all the\r\nexternal joints of the bones, as the shoulder, elbow, wrists,\r\nfinger-joints, hips, knees, ankle-bone and toes and the like; all of\r\nwhich shall be told in its place. The greatest thickness acquired by\r\nany limb is at the part of the muscles which is farthest from its\r\nattachments. Flesh never increases on those portions of the limb where the bones\r\nare near to the surface. At _b r d a c e f_ the increase or diminution of the flesh never\r\nmakes any considerable difference. Nature has placed in front of man\r\nall those parts which feel most pain under a blow; and these are the\r\nshin of the leg, the forehead, and the nose. And this was done for\r\nthe preservation of man, since, if such pain were not felt in these\r\nparts, the number of blows to which they would be exposed must be\r\nthe cause of their destruction.

I would have the same thing understood as applying to\r\nall animals and plants; in diminishing, [the various parts] do so in\r\ndue proportion to the size, as also in enlarging. 367. OF THE AGREEMENT OF THE PROPORTION OF THE LIMBS. And again, remember to be very careful in giving your figures limbs,\r\nthat they must appear to agree with the size of the body and\r\nlikewise to the age. Thus a youth has limbs that are not very\r\nmuscular not strongly veined, and the surface is delicate and round,\r\nand tender in colour. In man the limbs are sinewy and muscular,\r\nwhile in old men the surface is wrinkled, rugged and knotty, and the\r\nsinews very prominent. HOW YOUNG BOYS HAVE THEIR JOINTS JUST THE REVERSE OF THOSE OF MEN,\r\nAS TO SIZE. Little children have all the joints slender and the portions between\r\nthem are thick; and this happens because nothing but the skin covers\r\nthe joints without any other flesh and has the character of sinew,\r\nconnecting the bones like a ligature. And the fat fleshiness is laid\r\non between one joint and the next, and between the skin and the\r\nbones. But, since the bones are thicker at the joints than between\r\nthem, as a mass grows up the flesh ceases to have that superfluity\r\nwhich it had, between the skin and the bones; whence the skin clings\r\nmore closely to the bone and the limbs grow more slender. But since\r\nthere is nothing over the joints but the cartilaginous and sinewy\r\nskin this cannot dry up, and, not drying up, cannot shrink. Thus,\r\nand for this reason, children are slender at the joints and fat\r\nbetween the joints; as may be seen in the joints of the fingers,\r\narms, and shoulders, which are slender and dimpled, while in man on\r\nthe contrary all the joints of the fingers, arms, and legs are\r\nthick; and wherever children have hollows men have prominences. The movement of the human figure (368-375). 368. Of the manner of representing the 18 actions of man. Repose,\r\nmovement, running, standing, supported, sitting, leaning, kneeling,\r\nlying down, suspended. Carrying or being carried, thrusting,\r\npulling, striking, being struck, pressing down and lifting up. [As to how a figure should stand with a weight in its hand [Footnote\r\n8: The original text ends here.] Remember]. 369. A sitting man cannot raise himself if that part of his body which is\r\nfront of his axis [centre of gravity] does not weigh more than that\r\nwhich is behind that axis [or centre] without using his arms. A man who is mounting any slope finds that he must involuntarily\r\nthrow the most weight forward, on the higher foot, rather than\r\nbehind--that is in front of the axis and not behind it. Hence a man\r\nwill always, involuntarily, throw the greater weight towards the\r\npoint whither he desires to move than in any other direction. The faster a man runs, the more he leans forward towards the point\r\nhe runs to and throws more weight in front of his axis than behind. A man who runs down hill throws the axis onto his heels, and one who\r\nruns up hill throws it into the points of his feet; and a man\r\nrunning on level ground throws it first on his heels and then on the\r\npoints of his feet. This man cannot carry his own weight unless, by drawing his body\r\nback he balances the weight in front, in such a way as that the foot\r\non which he stands is the centre of gravity.

OF DRAWING. When a man who is running wants to neutralise the impetus that\r\ncarries him on he prepares a contrary impetus which is generated by\r\nhis hanging backwards. This can be proved, since, if the impetus\r\ncarries a moving body with a momentum equal to 4 and the moving body\r\nwants to turn and fall back with a momentum of 4, then one momentum\r\nneutralises the other contrary one, and the impetus is neutralised.

A man, in going up stairs involuntarily throws so much weight\r\nforward and on the side of the upper foot as to be a counterpoise to\r\nthe lower leg, so that the labour of this lower leg is limited to\r\nmoving itself. The first thing a man does in mounting steps is to relieve the leg\r\nhe is about to lift of the weight of the body which was resting on\r\nthat leg; and besides this, he gives to the opposite leg all the\r\nrest of the bulk of the whole man, including [the weight of] the\r\nother leg; he then raises the other leg and sets the foot upon the\r\nstep to which he wishes to raise himself. Having done this he\r\nrestores to the upper foot all the weight of the body and of the leg\r\nitself, and places his hand on his thigh and throws his head forward\r\nand repeats the movement towards the point of the upper foot,\r\nquickly lifting the heel of the lower one; and with this impetus he\r\nlifts himself up and at the same time extends the arm which rested\r\non his knee; and this extension of the arm carries up the body and\r\nthe head, and so straightens the spine which was curved.

When you want to represent a man as moving some weight consider what\r\nthe movements are that are to be represented by different lines;\r\nthat is to say either from below upwards, with a simple movement, as\r\na man does who stoops forward to take up a weight which he will lift\r\nas he straightens himself. Or as a man does who wants to squash\r\nsomething backwards, or to force it forwards or to pull it downwards\r\nwith ropes passed through pullies [Footnote 10: Compare the sketch\r\non page 198 and on 201 (S. K. M. II.1 86b).]. And here remember that\r\nthe weight of a man pulls in proportion as his centre of gravity is\r\ndistant from his fulcrum, and to this is added the force given by\r\nhis legs and bent back as he raises himself. 381. Again, a man has even a greater store of strength in his legs than\r\nhe needs for his own weight; and to see if this is true, make a man\r\nstand on the shore-sand and then put another man on his back, and\r\nyou will see how much he will sink in. Then take the man from off\r\nhis back and make him jump straight up as high as he can, and you\r\nwill find that the print of his feet will be made deeper by the jump\r\nthan from having the man on his back. Hence, here, by 2 methods it\r\nis proved that a man has double the strength he requires to support\r\nhis own body. 382. OF PAINTING. If you have to draw a man who is in motion, or lifting or pulling,\r\nor carrying a weight equal to his own, in what way must you set on\r\nhis legs below his body? [Footnote: In the MS. this question remains unanswered.]\r\n\r\n383. OF THE STRENGTH OF MAN. A man pulling a [dead] weight balanced against himself cannot pull\r\nmore than his own weight. And if he has to raise it he will [be able\r\nto] raise as much more than his weight as his strength may be more\r\nthan that of other men. [Footnote 7: The stroke at the end of this\r\nline finishes in the original in a sort of loop or flourish, and a\r\nsimilar flourish occurs at the end of the previous passage written\r\non the same page. M. RAVAISSON regards these as numbers (compare the\r\nphotograph of page 30b in his edition of MS. A). He remarks: \"_Ce\r\nchiffre_ 8 _et, a la fin de l'alinea precedent, le chiffre_ 7 _sont,\r\ndans le manuscrit, des renvois_.\"] The greatest force a man can\r\napply, with equal velocity and impetus, will be when he sets his\r\nfeet on one end of the balance [or lever] and then presses his\r\nshoulders against some stable body. This will raise a weight at the\r\nother end of the balance [lever], equal to his own weight and [added\r\nto that] as much weight as he can carry on his shoulders. 384. No animal can simply move [by its dead weight] a greater weight than\r\nthe sum of its own weight outside the centre of his fulcrum. 385. A man who wants to send an arrow very far from the bow must be\r\nstanding entirely on one foot and raising the other so far from the\r\nfoot he stands on as to afford the requisite counterpoise to his\r\nbody which is thrown on the front foot. And he must not hold his arm\r\nfully extended, and in order that he may be more able to bear the\r\nstrain he must hold a piece of wood which there is in all crossbows,\r\nextending from the hand to the breast, and when he wishes to shoot\r\nhe suddenly leaps forward at the same instant and extends his arm\r\nwith the bow and releases the string. And if he dexterously does\r\nevery thing at once it will go a very long way. 386. When two men are at the opposite ends of a plank that is balanced,\r\nand if they are of equal weight, and if one of them wants to make a\r\nleap into the air, then his leap will be made down from his end of\r\nthe plank and the man will never go up again but must remain in his\r\nplace till the man at the other end dashes up the board.", "sentences": ["A man coming down hill takes little steps, because the weight rests\r\nupon the hinder foot, while a man mounting takes wide steps, because\r\nhis weight rests on the foremost foot.", "[Footnote: See Pl.", "XXIII, No.", "4.]\r\n\r\nOn the human body in action (380-388).", "380.", "OF THE HUMAN BODY IN ACTION.", "When you want to represent a man as moving some weight consider what\r\nthe movements are that are to be represented by different lines;\r\nthat is to say either from below upwards, with a simple movement, as\r\na man does who stoops forward to take up a weight which he will lift\r\nas he straightens himself.", "Or as a man does who wants to squash\r\nsomething backwards, or to force it forwards or to pull it downwards\r\nwith ropes passed through pullies [Footnote 10: Compare the sketch\r\non page 198 and on 201 (S.", "K.", "M.", "II.1 86b).].", "And here remember that\r\nthe weight of a man pulls in proportion as his centre of gravity is\r\ndistant from his fulcrum, and to this is added the force given by\r\nhis legs and bent back as he raises himself.", "381.", "Again, a man has even a greater store of strength in his legs than\r\nhe needs for his own weight; and to see if this is true, make a man\r\nstand on the shore-sand and then put another man on his back, and\r\nyou will see how much he will sink in.", "Then take the man from off\r\nhis back and make him jump straight up as high as he can, and you\r\nwill find that the print of his feet will be made deeper by the jump\r\nthan from having the man on his back.", "Hence, here, by 2 methods it\r\nis proved that a man has double the strength he requires to support\r\nhis own body.", "382.", "OF PAINTING.", "If you have to draw a man who is in motion, or lifting or pulling,\r\nor carrying a weight equal to his own, in what way must you set on\r\nhis legs below his body?", "[Footnote: In the MS.", "this question remains unanswered.]\r\n\r\n383.", "OF THE STRENGTH OF MAN.", "A man pulling a [dead] weight balanced against himself cannot pull\r\nmore than his own weight.", "And if he has to raise it he will [be able\r\nto] raise as much more than his weight as his strength may be more\r\nthan that of other men.", "[Footnote 7: The stroke at the end of this\r\nline finishes in the original in a sort of loop or flourish, and a\r\nsimilar flourish occurs at the end of the previous passage written\r\non the same page.", "M.", "RAVAISSON regards these as numbers (compare the\r\nphotograph of page 30b in his edition of MS.", "A).", "He remarks: \"_Ce\r\nchiffre_ 8 _et, a la fin de l'alinea precedent, le chiffre_ 7 _sont,\r\ndans le manuscrit, des renvois_.\"] The greatest force a man can\r\napply, with equal velocity and impetus, will be when he sets his\r\nfeet on one end of the balance [or lever] and then presses his\r\nshoulders against some stable body.", "This will raise a weight at the\r\nother end of the balance [lever], equal to his own weight and [added\r\nto that] as much weight as he can carry on his shoulders.", "384.", "No animal can simply move [by its dead weight] a greater weight than\r\nthe sum of its own weight outside the centre of his fulcrum.", "385.", "A man who wants to send an arrow very far from the bow must be\r\nstanding entirely on one foot and raising the other so far from the\r\nfoot he stands on as to afford the requisite counterpoise to his\r\nbody which is thrown on the front foot.", "And he must not hold his arm\r\nfully extended, and in order that he may be more able to bear the\r\nstrain he must hold a piece of wood which there is in all crossbows,\r\nextending from the hand to the breast, and when he wishes to shoot\r\nhe suddenly leaps forward at the same instant and extends his arm\r\nwith the bow and releases the string.", "And if he dexterously does\r\nevery thing at once it will go a very long way.", "386.", "When two men are at the opposite ends of a plank that is balanced,\r\nand if they are of equal weight, and if one of them wants to make a\r\nleap into the air, then his leap will be made down from his end of\r\nthe plank and the man will never go up again but must remain in his\r\nplace till the man at the other end dashes up the board."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_83", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 83)", "language": "it", "content": "[Footnote: See Pl.

[Footnote 1: The paper has been damaged at the\r\nend of line 1.] The impetus acquired in the line _a b c d_ is spent\r\nin the line _d e_ but not so completely but that some of its force\r\nremains in it and to this force is added the momentum in the line _d\r\ne_ with the force of the motive power, and it must follow than the\r\nimpetus multiplied by the blow is greater that the simple impetus\r\nproduced by the momentum _d e_. [Footnote 8: The sketch No. 2 on Pl. XXIV stands, in the original,\r\nbetween lines 7 and 8. Compare also the sketches on Pl.

Observe the motion of the surface of the water which resembles that\r\nof hair, and has two motions, of which one goes on with the flow of\r\nthe surface, the other forms the lines of the eddies; thus the water\r\nforms eddying whirlpools one part of which are due to the impetus of\r\nthe principal current and the other to the incidental motion and\r\nreturn flow.

That part of a fold which is farthest from the ends where it is\r\nconfined will fall most nearly in its natural form. Every thing by nature tends to remain at rest. Drapery, being of\r\nequal density and thickness on its wrong side and on its right, has\r\na tendency to lie flat; therefore when you give it a fold or plait\r\nforcing it out of its flatness note well the result of the\r\nconstraint in the part where it is most confined; and the part which\r\nis farthest from this constraint you will see relapses most into the\r\nnatural state; that is to say lies free and flowing. EXAMPLE. [Footnote 13: _a c sia_. In the original text _b_ is written instead\r\nof _c_--an evident slip of the pen.] Let _a b c_ be the fold of the\r\ndrapery spoken of above, _a c_ will be the places where this folded\r\ndrapery is held fast. I maintain that the part of the drapery which\r\nis farthest from the plaited ends will revert most to its natural\r\nform. Therefore, _b_ being farthest from _a_ and _c_ in the fold _a b c_\r\nit will be wider there than anywhere else. [Footnote: See Pl. XXVIII, No. 6, and compare the drawing from\r\nWindsor Pl.

How figures dressed in a cloak should not show the shape so much as\r\nthat the cloak looks as if it were next the flesh; since you surely\r\ncannot wish the cloak to be next the flesh, for you must suppose\r\nthat between the flesh and the cloak there are other garments which\r\nprevent the forms of the limbs appearing distinctly through the\r\ncloak.

TREES. Small, lofty, straggling, thick, that is as to foliage, dark, light,\r\nrusset, branched at the top; some directed towards the eye, some\r\ndownwards; with white stems; this transparent in the air, that not;\r\nsome standing close together, some scattered. The relative thickness of the branches to the trunk (393--396). 394. All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put\r\ntogether are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them]. All the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course,\r\nif they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main\r\nstream. 395. Every year when the boughs of a plant [or tree] have made an end of\r\nmaturing their growth, they will have made, when put together, a\r\nthickness equal to that of the main stem; and at every stage of its\r\nramification you will find the thickness of the said main stem; as:\r\n_i k_, _g h_, _e f_, _c d_, _a b_, will always be equal to each\r\nother; unless the tree is pollard--if so the rule does not hold\r\ngood. All the branches have a direction which tends to the centre of the\r\ntree _m_. [Footnote: The two sketches of leafless trees one above another on\r\nthe left hand side of Pl. XXVII, No. 1, belong to this passage.]\r\n\r\n396. If the plant n grows to the thickness shown at m, its branches will\r\ncorrespond [in thickness] to the junction a b in consequence of the\r\ngrowth inside as well as outside. The branches of trees or plants have a twist wherever a minor branch\r\nis given off; and this giving off the branch forms a fork; this said\r\nfork occurs between two angles of which the largest will be that\r\nwhich is on the side of the larger branch, and in proportion, unless\r\naccident has spoilt it. [Footnote: The sketches illustrating this are on the right hand side\r\nof PI. XXVII, No. I, and the text is also given there in facsimile.]\r\n\r\n397. There is no boss on branches which has not been produced by some\r\nbranch which has failed. The lower shoots on the branches of trees grow more than the upper\r\nones and this occurs only because the sap that nourishes them, being\r\nheavy, tends downwards more than upwards; and again, because those\r\n[branches] which grow downwards turn away from the shade which\r\nexists towards the centre of the plant. The older the branches are,\r\nthe greater is the difference between their upper and their lower\r\nshoots and in those dating from the same year or epoch. [Footnote: The sketch accompanying this in the MS. is so effaced\r\nthat an exact reproduction was impossible.]\r\n\r\n398. OF THE SCARS ON TREES. The scars on trees grow to a greater thickness than is required by\r\nthe sap of the limb which nourishes them. 399. The plant which gives out the smallest ramifications will preserve\r\nthe straightest line in the course of its growth. [Footnote: This passage is illustrated by two partly effaced\r\nsketches. One of these closely resembles the lower one given under\r\nNo. 408, the other also represents short closely set boughs on an\r\nupright trunk.]\r\n\r\n400. OF THE RAMIFICATION. The beginning of the ramification [the shoot] always has the central\r\nline [axis] of its thickness directed to the central line [axis] of\r\nthe plant itself. 401. In starting from the main stem the branches always form a base with\r\na prominence as is shown at _a b c d_. 402.

But if the ramifications are equal in their growth, the veins of the\r\nmain stem will be straight [parallel] and equidistant at every\r\ndegree of the height of the plant.

The direction of growth (403-407). 403. OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF PLANTS. The plants which spread very much have the angles of the spaces\r\nwhich divide their branches more obtuse in proportion as their point\r\nof origin is lower down; that is nearer to the thickest and oldest\r\nportion of the tree. Therefore in the youngest portions of the tree\r\nthe angles of ramification are more acute. [Footnote: Compare the\r\nsketches on the lower portion of Pl. XXVII, No. 2.]\r\n\r\n404. The tips of the boughs of plants [and trees], unless they are borne\r\ndown by the weight of their fruits, turn towards the sky as much as\r\npossible. The upper side of their leaves is turned towards the sky that it may\r\nreceive the nourishment of the dew which falls at night. The sun gives spirit and life to plants and the earth nourishes them\r\nwith moisture. [9] With regard to this I made the experiment of\r\nleaving only one small root on a gourd and this I kept nourished\r\nwith water, and the gourd brought to perfection all the fruits it\r\ncould produce, which were about 60 gourds of the long kind, andi set\r\nmy mind diligently [to consider] this vitality and perceived that\r\nthe dews of night were what supplied it abundantly with moisture\r\nthrough the insertion of its large leaves and gave nourishment to\r\nthe plant and its offspring--or the seeds which its offspring had\r\nto produce--[21]. The rule of the leaves produced on the last shoot of the year will\r\nbe that they will grow in a contrary direction on the twin branches;\r\nthat is, that the insertion of the leaves turns round each branch in\r\nsuch a way, as that the sixth leaf above is produced over the sixth\r\nleaf below, and the way they turn is that if one turns towards its\r\ncompanion to the right, the other turns to the left, the leaf\r\nserving as the nourishing breast for the shoot or fruit which grows\r\nthe following year. [Footnote: A French translation of lines 9-12 was given by M. RAVAISSON in the _Gazette des Beaux Arts_, Oct. 1877; his paper also\r\ncontains some valuable information as to botanical science in the\r\nancient classical writers and at the time of the Renaissance.]\r\n\r\n405. The lowest branches of those trees which have large leaves and heavy\r\nfruits, such as nut-trees, fig-trees and the like, always droop\r\ntowards the ground. The branches always originate above [in the axis of] the leaves. 406. The upper shoots of the lateral branches of plants lie closer to the\r\nparent branch than the lower ones. 407. The lowest branches, after they have formed the angle of their\r\nseparation from the parent stem, always bend downwards so as not to\r\ncrowd against the other branches which follow them on the same stem\r\nand to be better able to take the air which nourishes them.

The thickness of a branch never diminishes within the space between\r\none leaf and the next excepting by so much as the thickness of the\r\nbud which is above the leaf and this thickness is taken off from the\r\nbranch above [the node] as far as the next leaf. Nature has so placed the leaves of the latest shoots of many plants\r\nthat the sixth leaf is always above the first, and so on in\r\nsuccession, if the rule is not [accidentally] interfered with; and\r\nthis occurs for two useful ends in the plant: First that as the\r\nshoot and the fruit of the following year spring from the bud or eye\r\nwhich lies above and in close contact with the insertion of the leaf\r\n[in the axil], the water which falls upon the shoot can run down to\r\nnourish the bud, by the drop being caught in the hollow [axil] at\r\nthe insertion of the leaf. And the second advantage is, that as\r\nthese shoots develop in the following year one will not cover the\r\nnext below, since the 5 come forth on five different sides; and the\r\nsixth which is above the first is at some distance. 416. OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF TREES AND THEIR FOLIAGE. The ramifications of any tree, such as the elm, are wide and slender\r\nafter the manner of a hand with spread fingers, foreshortened. And\r\nthese are seen in the distribution [thus]: the lower portions are\r\nseen from above; and those that are above are seen from below; and\r\nthose in the middle, some from below and some from above. The upper\r\npart is the extreme [top] of this ramification and the middle\r\nportion is more foreshortened than any other of those which are\r\nturned with their tips towards you. And of those parts of the middle\r\nof the height of the tree, the longest will be towards the top of\r\nthe tree and will produce a ramification like the foliage of the\r\ncommon willow, which grows on the banks of rivers. Other ramifications are spherical, as those of such trees as put\r\nforth their shoots and leaves in the order of the sixth being placed\r\nabove the first. Others are thin and light like the willow and\r\nothers. 417. You will see in the lower branches of the elder, which puts forth\r\nleaves two and two placed crosswise [at right angles] one above\r\nanother, that if the stem rises straight up towards the sky this\r\norder never fails;

and as, by the law of all leaves, they are compelled to\r\nturn their upper surface towards the sky to catch the dew at night,\r\nit is necessary that those so placed should twist round and no\r\nlonger form a cross. [Footnote: See Pl. XXVII, No. 5.]\r\n\r\n418. A leaf always turns its upper side towards the sky so that it may\r\nthe better receive, on all its surface, the dew which drops gently\r\nfrom the atmosphere. And these leaves are so distributed on the\r\nplant as that one shall cover the other as little as possible, but\r\nshall lie alternately one above another as may be seen in the ivy\r\nwhich covers the walls. And this alternation serves two ends; that\r\nis, to leave intervals by which the air and sun may penetrate\r\nbetween them. The 2nd reason is that the drops which fall from the\r\nfirst leaf may fall onto the fourth or--in other trees--onto the\r\nsixth. 419. Every shoot and every fruit is produced above the insertion [in the\r\naxil] of its leaf which serves it as a mother, giving it water from\r\nthe rain and moisture from the dew which falls at night from above,\r\nand often it protects them against the too great heat of the rays of\r\nthe sun.

XXVIII, No. 1.]\r\n\r\n421. Young plants have more transparent leaves and a more lustrous bark\r\nthan old ones; and particularly the walnut is lighter coloured in\r\nMay than in September. 422. OF THE ACCIDENTS OF COLOURING IN TREES. The accidents of colour in the foliage of trees are 4. That is:\r\nshadow, light, lustre [reflected light] and transparency. OF THE VISIBILITY OF THESE ACCIDENTS. These accidents of colour in the foliage of trees become confused at\r\na great distance and that which has most breadth [whether light or\r\nshade, &c.] will be most conspicuous. The proportions of light and shade in a leaf (423-426). 423. OF THE SHADOWS OF A LEAF. Sometimes a leaf has three accidents [of light] that is: shade,\r\nlustre [reflected light] and transparency [transmitted light]. Thus,\r\nif the light were at _n_ as regards the leaf _s_, and the eye at\r\n_m_, it would see _a_ in full light, _b_ in shadow and _c_\r\ntransparent. 424. A leaf with a concave surface seen from the under side and\r\nup-side-down will sometimes show itself as half in shade, and half\r\ntransparent. Thus, if _o p_ is the leaf and the light _m_ and the\r\neye _n_, this will see _o_ in shadow because the light does not fall\r\nupon it between equal angles, neither on the upper nor the under\r\nside, and _p_ is lighted on the upper side and the light is\r\ntransmitted to its under side. [Footnote: See Pl. XXVIII, No. 2, the\r\nupper sketch on the page. In the original they are drawn in red\r\nchalk.]\r\n\r\n425. Although those leaves which have a polished surface are to a great\r\nextent of the same colour on the right side and on the reverse, it\r\nmay happen that the side which is turned towards the atmosphere will\r\nhave something of the colour of the atmosphere; and it will seem to\r\nhave more of this colour of the atmosphere in proportion as the eye\r\nis nearer to it and sees it more foreshortened. And, without\r\nexception the shadows show as darker on the upper side than on the\r\nlower, from the contrast offered by the high lights which limit the\r\nshadows.

The shadows in transparent leaves seen from the under side are the\r\nsame shadows as there are on the right side of this leaf, they will\r\nshow through to the underside together with lights, but the lustre\r\n[reflected light] can never show through. 428. When one green has another [green] behind it, the lustre on the\r\nleaves and their transparent [lights] show more strongly than in\r\nthose which are [seen] against the brightness of the atmosphere. And if the sun illuminates the leaves without their coming between\r\nit and the eye and without the eye facing the sun, then the\r\nreflected lights and the transparent lights are very strong. It is very effective to show some branches which are low down and\r\ndark and so set off the illuminated greens which are at some\r\ndistance from the dark greens seen below.

Never paint leaves transparent to the sun, because they are\r\nconfused; and this is because on the transparency of one leaf will\r\nbe seen the shadow of another leaf which is above it. This shadow\r\nhas a distinct outline and a certain depth of shade and sometimes is\r\n[as much as] half or a third of the leaf which is shaded; and\r\nconsequently such an arrangement is very confused and the imitation\r\nof it should be avoided.

In very many cases the positions of the leaves will be without\r\nshadow [or in full light], and their under side will be transparent\r\nand the right side lustrous [reflecting light]. 432. The willow and other similar trees, which have their boughs lopped\r\nevery 3 or 4 years, put forth very straight branches, and their\r\nshadow is about the middle where these boughs spring; and towards\r\nthe extreme ends they cast but little shade from having small leaves\r\nand few and slender branches. Hence the boughs which rise towards\r\nthe sky will have but little shade and little relief; and the\r\nbranches which are at an angle from the horizon, downwards, spring\r\nfrom the dark part of the shadow and grow thinner by degrees up to\r\ntheir ends, and these will be in strong relief, being in gradations\r\nof light against a background of shadow.

OF THE LIGHTS ON LEAVES OF A YELLOWISH GREEN. But leaves of a green verging on yellow when they reflect the\r\natmosphere do not produce a reflection verging on blue, inasmuch as\r\nevery thing which appears in a mirror takes some colour from that\r\nmirror, hence the blue of the atmosphere being reflected in the\r\nyellow of the leaf appears green, because blue and yellow mixed\r\ntogether make a very fine green colour, therefore the lustre of\r\nlight leaves verging on yellow will be greenish yellow. A classification of trees according to their colours. 435. The trees in a landscape are of various kinds of green, inasmuch as\r\nsome verge towards blackness, as firs, pines, cypresses, laurels,\r\nbox and the like. Some tend to yellow such as walnuts, and pears,\r\nvines and verdure. Some are both yellowish and dark as chesnuts,\r\nholm-oak. Some turn red in autumn as the service-tree, pomegranate,\r\nvine, and cherry; and some are whitish as the willow, olive, reeds\r\nand the like. Trees are of various forms ... The proportions of light and shade in trees (436-440). 436. OF A GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED LIGHT AS LIGHTING UP TREES. That part of the trees will be seen to lie in the least dark shadow\r\nwhich is farthest from the earth. To prove it let _a p_ be the tree, _n b c_ the illuminated\r\nhemisphere [the sky], the under portion of the tree faces the earth\r\n_p c_, that is on the side _o_, and it faces a small part of the\r\nhemisphere at _c d_. But the highest part of the convexity a faces\r\nthe greatest part of the hemisphere, that is _b c_. For this\r\nreason--and because it does not face the darkness of the earth--it\r\nis in fuller light. But if the tree has dense foliage, as the\r\nlaurel, arbutus, box or holm oak, it will be different; because,\r\nalthough _a_ does not face the earth, it faces the dark [green] of\r\nthe leaves cut up by many shadows, and this darkness is reflected\r\nonto the under sides of the leaves immediately above. Thus these\r\ntrees have their darkest shadows nearest to the middle of the tree. 437. OF THE SHADOWS OF VERDURE. The shadows of verdure are always somewhat blue, and so is every\r\nshadow of every object; and they assume this hue more in proportion\r\nas they are remote from the eye, and less in proportion as they are\r\nnearer. The leaves which reflect the blue of the atmosphere always\r\npresent themselves to the eye edgewise. OF THE ILLUMINATED PART OF VERDURE AND OF MOUNTAINS. The illuminated portion, at a great distance, will appear most\r\nnearly of its natural colour where the strongest light falls upon\r\nit. 438. OF TREES THAT ARE LIGHTED BY THE SUN AND BY THE ATMOSPHERE. In trees that are illuminated [both] by the sun and the atmosphere\r\nand that have leaves of a dark colour, one side will be illuminated\r\nby the atmosphere [only] and in consequence of this light will tend\r\nto blueness, while on the other side they will be illuminated by the\r\natmosphere and the sun; and the side which the eye sees illuminated\r\nby the sun will reflect light. 439. OF DEPICTING A FOREST SCENE. The trees and plants which are most thickly branched with slender\r\nbranches ought to have less dark shadow than those trees and plants\r\nwhich, having broader leaves, will cast more shadow. 440. ON PAINTING. In the position of the eye which sees that portion of a tree\r\nilluminated which turns towards the light, one tree will never be\r\nseen to be illuminated equally with the other. To prove this, let\r\nthe eye be _c_ which sees the two trees _b d_ which are illuminated\r\nby the sun _a_; I say that this eye _c_ will not see the light in\r\nthe same proportion to the shade, in one tree as in the other.", "sentences": ["And the\r\ncause of this is that the light on the illuminated portion mingles\r\nwith the dark hue to compose a blue colour; and this light is\r\nproduced by the blueness of the atmosphere which is reflected in the\r\nsmooth surface of these leaves and adds to the blue hue which this\r\nlight usually produces when it falls on dark objects.", "OF THE LIGHTS ON LEAVES OF A YELLOWISH GREEN.", "But leaves of a green verging on yellow when they reflect the\r\natmosphere do not produce a reflection verging on blue, inasmuch as\r\nevery thing which appears in a mirror takes some colour from that\r\nmirror, hence the blue of the atmosphere being reflected in the\r\nyellow of the leaf appears green, because blue and yellow mixed\r\ntogether make a very fine green colour, therefore the lustre of\r\nlight leaves verging on yellow will be greenish yellow.", "A classification of trees according to their colours.", "435.", "The trees in a landscape are of various kinds of green, inasmuch as\r\nsome verge towards blackness, as firs, pines, cypresses, laurels,\r\nbox and the like.", "Some tend to yellow such as walnuts, and pears,\r\nvines and verdure.", "Some are both yellowish and dark as chesnuts,\r\nholm-oak.", "Some turn red in autumn as the service-tree, pomegranate,\r\nvine, and cherry; and some are whitish as the willow, olive, reeds\r\nand the like.", "Trees are of various forms ...", "The proportions of light and shade in trees (436-440).", "436.", "OF A GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED LIGHT AS LIGHTING UP TREES.", "That part of the trees will be seen to lie in the least dark shadow\r\nwhich is farthest from the earth.", "To prove it let _a p_ be the tree, _n b c_ the illuminated\r\nhemisphere [the sky], the under portion of the tree faces the earth\r\n_p c_, that is on the side _o_, and it faces a small part of the\r\nhemisphere at _c d_.", "But the highest part of the convexity a faces\r\nthe greatest part of the hemisphere, that is _b c_.", "For this\r\nreason--and because it does not face the darkness of the earth--it\r\nis in fuller light.", "But if the tree has dense foliage, as the\r\nlaurel, arbutus, box or holm oak, it will be different; because,\r\nalthough _a_ does not face the earth, it faces the dark [green] of\r\nthe leaves cut up by many shadows, and this darkness is reflected\r\nonto the under sides of the leaves immediately above.", "Thus these\r\ntrees have their darkest shadows nearest to the middle of the tree.", "437.", "OF THE SHADOWS OF VERDURE.", "The shadows of verdure are always somewhat blue, and so is every\r\nshadow of every object; and they assume this hue more in proportion\r\nas they are remote from the eye, and less in proportion as they are\r\nnearer.", "The leaves which reflect the blue of the atmosphere always\r\npresent themselves to the eye edgewise.", "OF THE ILLUMINATED PART OF VERDURE AND OF MOUNTAINS.", "The illuminated portion, at a great distance, will appear most\r\nnearly of its natural colour where the strongest light falls upon\r\nit.", "438.", "OF TREES THAT ARE LIGHTED BY THE SUN AND BY THE ATMOSPHERE.", "In trees that are illuminated [both] by the sun and the atmosphere\r\nand that have leaves of a dark colour, one side will be illuminated\r\nby the atmosphere [only] and in consequence of this light will tend\r\nto blueness, while on the other side they will be illuminated by the\r\natmosphere and the sun; and the side which the eye sees illuminated\r\nby the sun will reflect light.", "439.", "OF DEPICTING A FOREST SCENE.", "The trees and plants which are most thickly branched with slender\r\nbranches ought to have less dark shadow than those trees and plants\r\nwhich, having broader leaves, will cast more shadow.", "440.", "ON PAINTING.", "In the position of the eye which sees that portion of a tree\r\nilluminated which turns towards the light, one tree will never be\r\nseen to be illuminated equally with the other.", "To prove this, let\r\nthe eye be _c_ which sees the two trees _b d_ which are illuminated\r\nby the sun _a_; I say that this eye _c_ will not see the light in\r\nthe same proportion to the shade, in one tree as in the other."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_92", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 92)", "language": "it", "content": "Because, the tree which is nearest to the sun will display so much\r\nthe stronger shadow than the more distant one, in proportion as one\r\ntree is nearer to the rays of the sun that converge to the eye than\r\nthe other; &c.

The shadows of trees placed in a landscape do not display themselves\r\nin the same position in the trees on the right hand and those on the\r\nleft; still more so if the sun is to the right or left. As is proved\r\nby the 4th which says: Opaque bodies placed between the light and\r\nthe eye display themselves entirely in shadow; and by the 5th: The\r\neye when placed between the opaque body and the light sees the\r\nopaque body entirely illuminated. And by the 6th: When the eye and\r\nthe opaque body are placed between darkness and light, it will be\r\nseen half in shadow and half in light. [Footnote: See the figure on the right hand side of Pl. XXVIII, No. 3. The first five lines of the text are written below the diagram\r\nand above it are the last eight lines of the text, given as No. 461.]\r\n\r\n442. OF THE HERBS OF THE FIELD. Of the plants which take a shadow from the plants which spring among\r\nthem, those which are on this side [in front] of the shadow have the\r\nstems lighted up on a background of shadow, and the plants on which\r\nthe shadows fall have their stems dark on a light background; that\r\nis on the background beyond the shadow. OF TREES WHICH ARE BETWEEN THE EYE AND THE LIGHT. Of the trees which are between the eye and the light the part in\r\nfront will be light; but this light will be broken by the\r\nramifications of transparent leaves--being seen from the under\r\nside--and lustrous leaves--being seen from the upper side; and the\r\nbackground below and behind will be dark green, being in shadow from\r\nthe front portion of the said tree. This occurs in trees placed\r\nabove the eye. 443. FROM WHENCE TO DEPICT A LANDSCAPE\r\n\r\nLandscapes should be represented so that the trees may be half in\r\nlight and half in shadow; but it is better to do them when the sun\r\nis covered with clouds, for then the trees are lighted by the\r\ngeneral light of the sky, and the general darkness of the earth. And\r\nthen they are darkest in certain parts in proportion as those parts\r\nare nearest to the middle of the tree and to the earth. The effects of morning light (444-448). 444. OF TREES TO THE SOUTH. When the sun is in the east the trees to the South and to the North\r\nhave almost as much light as shadow.

OF TREES. What outlines are seen in trees at a distance against the sky which\r\nserves as their background? The outlines of the ramification of trees, where they lie against\r\nthe illuminated sky, display a form which more nearly approaches the\r\nspherical on proportion as they are remote, and the nearer they are\r\nthe less they appear in this spherical form; as in the first tree\r\n_a_ which, being near to the eye, displays the true form of its\r\nramification; but this shows less in _b_ and is altogether lost in\r\n_c_, where not merely the branches of the tree cannot be seen but\r\nthe whole tree is distinguished with difficulty. Every object in\r\nshadow, of whatever form it may be, at a great distance appears to\r\nbe spherical. And this occurs because, if it is a square body, at a\r\nvery short distance it loses its angles, and a little farther off it\r\nloses still more of its smaller sides which remain. And thus before\r\nthe whole is lost [to sight] the parts are lost, being smaller than\r\nthe whole; as a man, who in such a distant position loses his legs,\r\narms and head before [the mass of] his body, then the outlines of\r\nlength are lost before those of breadth, and where they have become\r\nequal it would be a square if the angles remained; but as they are\r\nlost it is round.

The image of the shadow of any object of uniform breadth can never\r\nbe [exactly] the same as that of the body which casts it. [Footnote: See Pl. XXVIII, No. 5.]\r\n\r\nLight and shade on groups of trees (453-457). 453. All trees seen against the sun are dark towards the middle and this\r\nshadow will be of the shape of the tree when apart from others. The shadows cast by trees on which the sun shines are as dark as\r\nthose of the middle of the tree. The shadow cast by a tree is never less than the mass of the tree\r\nbut becomes taller in proportion as the spot on which it falls,\r\nslopes towards the centre of the world. The shadow will be densest in the middle of the tree when the tree\r\nhas the fewest branches.

The form of any shadow from a branch or tree is circumscribed by the\r\nlight which falls from the side whence the light comes; and this\r\nillumination gives the shape of the shadow, and this may be of the\r\ndistance of a mile from the side where the sun is. If it happens that a cloud should anywhere overshadow some part of a\r\nhill the [shadow of the] trees there will change less than in the\r\nplains; for these trees on the hills have their branches thicker,\r\nbecause they grow less high each year than in the plains. Therefore\r\nas these branches are dark by nature and being so full of shade, the\r\nshadow of the clouds cannot darken them any more; but the open\r\nspaces between the trees, which have no strong shadow change very\r\nmuch in tone and particularly those which vary from green; that is\r\nploughed lands or fallen mountains or barren lands or rocks.", "sentences": ["OF TREES WHICH CONCEAL THESE SPACES IN ONE ANOTHER.", "That part of a tree will show the fewest spaces, behind which a\r\nlarge number of trees are standing between the tree and the air\r\n[sky]; thus in the tree _a_ the spaces are not concealed nor in _b_,\r\nas there is no tree behind.", "But in _c_ only half shows the spaces\r\nfilled up by the tree _d_, and part of the tree _d_ is filled up by\r\nthe tree _e_ and a little farther on all the spaces in the mass of\r\nthe trees are lost, and only that at the side remains.", "451.", "OF TREES.", "What outlines are seen in trees at a distance against the sky which\r\nserves as their background?", "The outlines of the ramification of trees, where they lie against\r\nthe illuminated sky, display a form which more nearly approaches the\r\nspherical on proportion as they are remote, and the nearer they are\r\nthe less they appear in this spherical form; as in the first tree\r\n_a_ which, being near to the eye, displays the true form of its\r\nramification; but this shows less in _b_ and is altogether lost in\r\n_c_, where not merely the branches of the tree cannot be seen but\r\nthe whole tree is distinguished with difficulty.", "Every object in\r\nshadow, of whatever form it may be, at a great distance appears to\r\nbe spherical.", "And this occurs because, if it is a square body, at a\r\nvery short distance it loses its angles, and a little farther off it\r\nloses still more of its smaller sides which remain.", "And thus before\r\nthe whole is lost [to sight] the parts are lost, being smaller than\r\nthe whole; as a man, who in such a distant position loses his legs,\r\narms and head before [the mass of] his body, then the outlines of\r\nlength are lost before those of breadth, and where they have become\r\nequal it would be a square if the angles remained; but as they are\r\nlost it is round.", "[Footnote: The sketch No.", "4, Pl.", "XXVIII, belongs to this passage.]\r\n\r\nThe cast shadow of trees (452.", "453).", "452.", "The image of the shadow of any object of uniform breadth can never\r\nbe [exactly] the same as that of the body which casts it.", "[Footnote: See Pl.", "XXVIII, No.", "5.]\r\n\r\nLight and shade on groups of trees (453-457).", "453.", "All trees seen against the sun are dark towards the middle and this\r\nshadow will be of the shape of the tree when apart from others.", "The shadows cast by trees on which the sun shines are as dark as\r\nthose of the middle of the tree.", "The shadow cast by a tree is never less than the mass of the tree\r\nbut becomes taller in proportion as the spot on which it falls,\r\nslopes towards the centre of the world.", "The shadow will be densest in the middle of the tree when the tree\r\nhas the fewest branches.", "[Footnote: The three diagrams which accompany this text are placed,\r\nin the original, before lines 7-11.", "At the spots marked _B_ Leonardo\r\nwrote _Albero_ (tree).", "At _A_ is the word _Sole_ (sun), at _C Monte_\r\n(mountain) at _D piano_ (plain) and at _E cima_ (summit).]\r\n\r\nEvery branch participates of the central shadow of every other\r\nbranch and consequently [of that] of the whole tree.", "The form of any shadow from a branch or tree is circumscribed by the\r\nlight which falls from the side whence the light comes; and this\r\nillumination gives the shape of the shadow, and this may be of the\r\ndistance of a mile from the side where the sun is.", "If it happens that a cloud should anywhere overshadow some part of a\r\nhill the [shadow of the] trees there will change less than in the\r\nplains; for these trees on the hills have their branches thicker,\r\nbecause they grow less high each year than in the plains.", "Therefore\r\nas these branches are dark by nature and being so full of shade, the\r\nshadow of the clouds cannot darken them any more; but the open\r\nspaces between the trees, which have no strong shadow change very\r\nmuch in tone and particularly those which vary from green; that is\r\nploughed lands or fallen mountains or barren lands or rocks."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_95", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 95)", "language": "it", "content": "Where\r\nthe trees are against the atmosphere they appear all the same\r\ncolour--if indeed they are not very close together or very thickly\r\ncovered with leaves like the fir and similar trees.

OF TREES AND LIGHTS ON THEM. The best method of practice in representing country scenes, or I\r\nshould say landscapes with their trees, is to choose them so that\r\nthe sun is covered with clouds so that the landscape receives an\r\nuniversal light and not the direct light of the sun, which makes the\r\nshadows sharp and too strongly different from the lights. 461. OF PAINTING. In landscapes which represent [a scene in] winter. The mountains\r\nshould not be shown blue, as we see in the mountains in the summer. And this is proved [Footnote 5. 6.: _Per la_ 4_a di questo_. It is\r\nimpossible to ascertain what this quotation refers to. _Questo_\r\ncertainly does not mean the MS. in hand, nor any other now known to\r\nus. The same remark applies to the phrase in line 15: _per la_ 2_a\r\ndi questo_.] in the 4th of this which says: Among mountains seen\r\nfrom a great distance those will look of the bluest colour which are\r\nin themselves the darkest; hence, when the trees are stripped of\r\ntheir leaves, they will show a bluer tinge which will be in itself\r\ndarker; therefore, when the trees have lost their leaves they will\r\nlook of a gray colour, while, with their leaves, they are green, and\r\nin proportion as the green is darker than the grey hue the green\r\nwill be of a bluer tinge than the gray. Also by the 2nd of this: The\r\nshadows of trees covered with leaves are darker than the shadows of\r\nthose trees which have lost their leaves in proportion as the trees\r\ncovered with leaves are denser than those without leaves--and thus\r\nmy meaning is proved.

The colours of the shadows in mountains at a great distance take a\r\nmost lovely blue, much purer than their illuminated portions.

A place is most luminous when it is most remote from mountains. On the treatment of light for views of towns (465-469). 465. OF LIGHT AND SHADOW IN A TOWN. When the sun is in the East and the eye is above the centre of a\r\ntown, the eye will see the Southern part of the town with its roofs\r\nhalf in shade and half in light, and the same towards the North; the\r\nEastern side will be all in shadow and the Western will be all in\r\nlight. 466. Of the houses of a town, in which the divisions between the houses\r\nmay be distinguished by the light which fall on the mist at the\r\nbottom. If the eye is above the houses the light seen in the space\r\nthat is between one house and the next sinks by degrees into thicker\r\nmist; and yet, being less transparent, it appears whiter; and if the\r\nhouses are some higher than the others, since the true [colour] is\r\nalways more discernible through the thinner atmosphere, the houses\r\nwill look darker in proportion as they are higher up. Let _n o p q_\r\nrepresent the various density of the atmosphere thick with moisture,\r\n_a_ being the eye, the house _b c_ will look lightest at the bottom,\r\nbecause it is in a thicker atmosphere; the lines _c d f_ will appear\r\nequally light, for although _f_ is more distant than _c_, it is\r\nraised into a thinner atmosphere, if the houses _b e_ are of the\r\nsame height, because they cross a brightness which is varied by\r\nmist, but this is only because the line of the eye which starts from\r\nabove ends by piercing a lower and denser atmosphere at _d_ than at\r\n_b_. Thus the line a _f_ is lower at _f_ than at _c_; and the house\r\n_f_ will be seen darker at _e_ from the line _e k_ as far as _m_,\r\nthan the tops of the houses standing in front of it. 467. OF TOWNS OR OTHER BUILDINGS SEEN IN THE EVENING OR THE MORNING\r\nTHROUGH THE MIST. Of buildings seen at a great distance in the evening or the morning,\r\nas in mist or dense atmosphere, only those portions are seen in\r\nbrightness which are lighted up by the sun which is near the\r\nhorizon; and those portions which are not lighted up by the sun\r\nremain almost of the same colour and medium tone as the mist. WHY OBJECTS WHICH ARE HIGH UP AND AT A DISTANCE ARE DARKER THAN THE\r\nLOWER ONES, EVEN IF THE MIST IS UNIFORMLY DENSE. Of objects standing in a mist or other dense atmosphere, whether\r\nfrom vapour or smoke or distance, those will be most visible which\r\nare the highest. And among objects of equal height that will be the\r\ndarkest [strongest] which has for background the deepest mist.", "sentences": ["This is proved by the 7th of this which says\r\nthat a tree looks darkest when it is seen from below; the\r\nproposition is verified, since this hill will, on its upper half\r\nshow all its trees as much from the side which is lighted by the\r\nlight of the sky, as from that which is in shade from the darkness\r\nof the earth; whence it must result that these trees are of a medium\r\ndarkness.", "And from this [middle] spot towards the base of the hill,\r\nthese trees will be lighter by degrees by the converse of the 7th\r\nand by the said 7th: For trees so placed, the nearer they are to the\r\nsummit of the hill the darker they necessarily become.", "But this\r\ndarkness is not in proportion to the distance, by the 8th of this\r\nwhich says: That object shows darkest which is [seen] in the\r\nclearest atmosphere; and by the 10th: That shows darkest which\r\nstands out against a lighter background.", "[Footnote: The quotation in this passage again cannot be verified.]\r\n\r\n463.", "OF LANDSCAPES.", "The colours of the shadows in mountains at a great distance take a\r\nmost lovely blue, much purer than their illuminated portions.", "And\r\nfrom this it follows that when the rock of a mountain is reddish the\r\nilluminated portions are violet (?) and the more they are lighted\r\nthe more they display their proper colour.", "464.", "A place is most luminous when it is most remote from mountains.", "On the treatment of light for views of towns (465-469).", "465.", "OF LIGHT AND SHADOW IN A TOWN.", "When the sun is in the East and the eye is above the centre of a\r\ntown, the eye will see the Southern part of the town with its roofs\r\nhalf in shade and half in light, and the same towards the North; the\r\nEastern side will be all in shadow and the Western will be all in\r\nlight.", "466.", "Of the houses of a town, in which the divisions between the houses\r\nmay be distinguished by the light which fall on the mist at the\r\nbottom.", "If the eye is above the houses the light seen in the space\r\nthat is between one house and the next sinks by degrees into thicker\r\nmist; and yet, being less transparent, it appears whiter; and if the\r\nhouses are some higher than the others, since the true [colour] is\r\nalways more discernible through the thinner atmosphere, the houses\r\nwill look darker in proportion as they are higher up.", "Let _n o p q_\r\nrepresent the various density of the atmosphere thick with moisture,\r\n_a_ being the eye, the house _b c_ will look lightest at the bottom,\r\nbecause it is in a thicker atmosphere; the lines _c d f_ will appear\r\nequally light, for although _f_ is more distant than _c_, it is\r\nraised into a thinner atmosphere, if the houses _b e_ are of the\r\nsame height, because they cross a brightness which is varied by\r\nmist, but this is only because the line of the eye which starts from\r\nabove ends by piercing a lower and denser atmosphere at _d_ than at\r\n_b_.", "Thus the line a _f_ is lower at _f_ than at _c_; and the house\r\n_f_ will be seen darker at _e_ from the line _e k_ as far as _m_,\r\nthan the tops of the houses standing in front of it.", "467.", "OF TOWNS OR OTHER BUILDINGS SEEN IN THE EVENING OR THE MORNING\r\nTHROUGH THE MIST.", "Of buildings seen at a great distance in the evening or the morning,\r\nas in mist or dense atmosphere, only those portions are seen in\r\nbrightness which are lighted up by the sun which is near the\r\nhorizon; and those portions which are not lighted up by the sun\r\nremain almost of the same colour and medium tone as the mist.", "WHY OBJECTS WHICH ARE HIGH UP AND AT A DISTANCE ARE DARKER THAN THE\r\nLOWER ONES, EVEN IF THE MIST IS UNIFORMLY DENSE.", "Of objects standing in a mist or other dense atmosphere, whether\r\nfrom vapour or smoke or distance, those will be most visible which\r\nare the highest.", "And among objects of equal height that will be the\r\ndarkest [strongest] which has for background the deepest mist."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_98", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 98)", "language": "it", "content": "Thus\r\nthe eye _h_ looking at _a b c_, towers of equal height, one with\r\nanother, sees _c_ the top of the first tower at _r_, at two degrees\r\nof depth in the mist; and sees the height of the middle tower _b_\r\nthrough one single degree of mist. Therefore the top of the tower\r\n_c_ appears stronger than the top of the tower _b_, &c. 468. OF THE SMOKE OF A TOWN. Smoke is seen better and more distinctly on the Eastern side than on\r\nthe Western when the sun is in the East; and this arises from two\r\ncauses; the first is that the sun, with its rays, shines through the\r\nparticles of the smoke and lights them up and makes them visible. The second is that the roofs of the houses seen in the East at this\r\ntime are in shadow, because their obliquity does not allow of their\r\nbeing illuminated by the sun. And the same thing occurs with dust;\r\nand both one and the other look the lighter in proportion as they\r\nare denser, and they are densest towards the middle. 469. OF SMOKE AND DUST. If the sun is in the East the smoke of cities will not be visible in\r\nthe West, because on that side it is not seen penetrated by the\r\nsolar rays, nor on a dark background; since the roofs of the houses\r\nturn the same side to the eye as they turn towards the sun, and on\r\nthis light background the smoke is not very visible. But dust, under the same aspect, will look darker than smoke being\r\nof denser material than smoke which is moist. The effect of wind on trees (470-473). 470. OF REPRESENTING WIND. In representing wind, besides the bending of the boughs and the\r\nreversing of their leaves towards the quarter whence the wind comes,\r\nyou should also represent them amid clouds of fine dust mingled with\r\nthe troubled air. 471. Describe landscapes with the wind, and the water, and the setting\r\nand rising of the sun. THE WIND. All the leaves which hung towards the earth by the bending of the\r\nshoots with their branches, are turned up side down by the gusts of\r\nwind, and here their perspective is reversed; for, if the tree is\r\nbetween you and the quarter of the wind, the leaves which are\r\ntowards you remain in their natural aspect, while those on the\r\nopposite side which ought to have their points in a contrary\r\ndirection have, by being turned over, their points turned towards\r\nyou. 472. Trees struck by the force of the wind bend to the side towards which\r\nthe wind is blowing; and the wind being past they bend in the\r\ncontrary direction, that is in reverse motion. 473. That portion of a tree which is farthest from the force which\r\nstrikes it is the most injured by the blow because it bears most\r\nstrain; thus nature has foreseen this case by thickening them in\r\nthat part where they can be most hurt; and most in such trees as\r\ngrow to great heights, as pines and the like.

But, when the eye is between the cloud and the sun, the cloud has\r\nthe contrary effect to the former, for the edges of its mass are\r\ndark and it is light towards the middle; and this happens because\r\nyou see the same side as faces the sun, and because the edges have\r\nsome transparency and reveal to the eye that portion which is hidden\r\nbeyond them, and which, as it does not catch the sunlight like that\r\nportion turned towards it, is necessarily somewhat darker.

The black clouds which are often seen higher up than those which are\r\nilluminated by the sun are shaded by other clouds, lying between\r\nthem and the sun. Again, the rounded forms of the clouds that face the sun, show their\r\nedges dark because they lie against the light background; and to see\r\nthat this is true, you may look at the top of any cloud that is\r\nwholly light because it lies against the blue of the atmosphere,\r\nwhich is darker than the cloud.

But the\r\nwater reflects the object from one side and the man sees it from the\r\nother; and it often happens that the painter sees an object from\r\nbelow, and thus one and the same object is seen from hind part\r\nbefore and upside down, because the water shows the image of the\r\nobject in one way, and the eye sees it in another. Of rainbows and rain (479. 480). 479. The colours in the middle of the rainbow mingle together. The bow in itself is not in the rain nor in the eye that sees it;\r\nthough it is generated by the rain, the sun, and the eye. The\r\nrainbow is always seen by the eye that is between the rain and the\r\nbody of the sun; hence if the sun is in the East and the rain is in\r\nthe West it will appear on the rain in the West. 480.", "sentences": ["When clouds come between the sun and the eye all the upper edges of\r\ntheir round forms are light, and towards the middle they are dark,\r\nand this happens because towards the top these edges have the sun\r\nabove them while you are below them; and the same thing happens with\r\nthe position of the branches of trees; and again the clouds, like\r\nthe trees, being somewhat transparent, are lighted up in part, and\r\nat the edges they show thinner.", "But, when the eye is between the cloud and the sun, the cloud has\r\nthe contrary effect to the former, for the edges of its mass are\r\ndark and it is light towards the middle; and this happens because\r\nyou see the same side as faces the sun, and because the edges have\r\nsome transparency and reveal to the eye that portion which is hidden\r\nbeyond them, and which, as it does not catch the sunlight like that\r\nportion turned towards it, is necessarily somewhat darker.", "Again, it\r\nmay be that you see the details of these rounded masses from the\r\nlower side, while the sun shines on the upper side and as they are\r\nnot so situated as to reflect the light of the sun, as in the first\r\ninstance they remain dark.", "The black clouds which are often seen higher up than those which are\r\nilluminated by the sun are shaded by other clouds, lying between\r\nthem and the sun.", "Again, the rounded forms of the clouds that face the sun, show their\r\nedges dark because they lie against the light background; and to see\r\nthat this is true, you may look at the top of any cloud that is\r\nwholly light because it lies against the blue of the atmosphere,\r\nwhich is darker than the cloud.", "[Footnote: A drawing in red chalk from the Windsor collection (see\r\nPl.", "XXIX), representing a landscape with storm-clouds, may serve to\r\nillustrate this section as well as the following one.]\r\n\r\n477.", "OF CLOUDS, SMOKE AND DUST AND THE FLAMES OF A FURNACE OR OF A\r\nBURNING KILN.", "The clouds do not show their rounded forms excepting on the sides\r\nwhich face the sun; on the others the roundness is imperceptible\r\nbecause they are in the shade.", "[Footnote: The text of this chapter\r\nis given in facsimile on Pls.", "XXXVI and XXXVII.", "The two halves of\r\nthe leaf form but one in the original.", "On the margin close to lines\r\n4 and 5 is the note: _rossore d'aria inverso l'orizonte_--(of the\r\nredness of the atmosphere near the horizon).", "The sketches on the\r\nlower portion of the page will be spoken of in No.", "668.]\r\n\r\nIf the sun is in the East and the clouds in the West, the eye placed\r\nbetween the sun and the clouds sees the edges of the rounded forms\r\ncomposing these clouds as dark, and the portions which are\r\nsurrounded by this dark [edge] are light.", "And this occurs because\r\nthe edges of the rounded forms of these clouds are turned towards\r\nthe upper or lateral sky, which is reflected in them.", "Both the cloud and the tree display no roundness at all on their\r\nshaded side.", "On images reflected in water.", "478.", "Painters often deceive themselves, by representing water in which\r\nthey make the water reflect the objects seen by the man.", "But the\r\nwater reflects the object from one side and the man sees it from the\r\nother; and it often happens that the painter sees an object from\r\nbelow, and thus one and the same object is seen from hind part\r\nbefore and upside down, because the water shows the image of the\r\nobject in one way, and the eye sees it in another.", "Of rainbows and rain (479.", "480).", "479.", "The colours in the middle of the rainbow mingle together.", "The bow in itself is not in the rain nor in the eye that sees it;\r\nthough it is generated by the rain, the sun, and the eye.", "The\r\nrainbow is always seen by the eye that is between the rain and the\r\nbody of the sun; hence if the sun is in the East and the rain is in\r\nthe West it will appear on the rain in the West.", "480."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_100", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 100)", "language": "it", "content": "When the air is condensed into rain it would produce a vacuum if the\r\nrest of the air did not prevent this by filling its place, as it\r\ndoes with a violent rush; and this is the wind which rises in the\r\nsummer time, accompanied by heavy rain.

IX. _The Practice of Painting._\r\n\r\n_It is hardly necessary to offer any excuses for the division\r\ncarried out in the arrangement of the text into practical\r\nsuggestions and theoretical enquiries. It was evidently intended by\r\nLeonardo himself as we conclude from incidental remarks in the MSS. (for instance No_ 110_). The fact that this arrangement was never\r\ncarried out either in the old MS. copies or in any edition since, is\r\neasily accounted for by the general disorder which results from the\r\nprovisional distribution of the various chapters in the old copies. We have every reason to believe that the earliest copyists, in\r\ndistributing the materials collected by them, did not in the least\r\nconsider the order in which the original MS.lay before them._\r\n\r\n_It is evident that almost all the chapters which refer to the\r\ncalling and life of the painter--and which are here brought together\r\nin the first section (Nos._ 482-508_)--may be referred to two\r\ndistinct periods in Leonardo's life; most of them can be dated as\r\nbelonging to the year_ 1492 _or to_ 1515. _At about this later time\r\nLeonardo may have formed the project of completing his Libro della\r\nPittura, after an interval of some years, as it would seem, during\r\nwhich his interest in the subject had fallen somewhat into the\r\nbackground._\r\n\r\n_In the second section, which treats first of the artist's studio,\r\nthe construction of a suitable window forms the object of careful\r\ninvestigations; the special importance attached to this by Leonardo\r\nis sufficiently obvious. His theory of the incidence of light which\r\nwas fully discussed in a former part of this work, was to him by no\r\nmeans of mere abstract value, but, being deduced, as he says, from\r\nexperience (or experiment) was required to prove its utility in\r\npractice. Connected with this we find suggestions for the choice of\r\na light with practical hints as to sketching a picture and some\r\nother precepts of a practical character which must come under\r\nconsideration in the course of completing the painting. In all this\r\nI have followed the same principle of arrangement in the text as was\r\ncarried out in the Theory of Painting, thus the suggestions for the\r\nPerspective of a picture, (Nos._ 536-569_), are followed by the\r\ntheory of light and shade for the practical method of optics (Nos._\r\n548--566_) and this by the practical precepts or the treatment of\r\naerial perspective (_567--570_)._\r\n\r\n_In the passage on Portrait and Figure Painting the principles of\r\npainting as applied to a bust and head are separated and placed\r\nfirst, since the advice to figure painters must have some connection\r\nwith the principles of the treatment of composition by which they\r\nare followed._\r\n\r\n_But this arrangement of the text made it seem advisable not to pick\r\nout the practical precepts as to the representation of trees and\r\nlandscape from the close connection in which they were originally\r\nplaced--unlike the rest of the practical precepts--with the theory\r\nof this branch of the subject. They must therefore be sought under\r\nthe section entitled Botany for Painters._\r\n\r\n_As a supplement to the_ Libro di Pittura _I have here added those\r\ntexts which treat of the Painter's materials,--as chalk, drawing\r\npaper, colours and their preparation, of the management of oils and\r\nvarnishes; in the appendix are some notes on chemical substances. Possibly some of these, if not all, may have stood in connection\r\nwith the preparation of colours.", "sentences": ["When the air is condensed into rain it would produce a vacuum if the\r\nrest of the air did not prevent this by filling its place, as it\r\ndoes with a violent rush; and this is the wind which rises in the\r\nsummer time, accompanied by heavy rain.", "Of flower seeds.", "481.", "All the flowers which turn towards the sun perfect their seeds; but\r\nnot the others; that is to say those which get only the reflection\r\nof the sun.", "IX.", "_The Practice of Painting._\r\n\r\n_It is hardly necessary to offer any excuses for the division\r\ncarried out in the arrangement of the text into practical\r\nsuggestions and theoretical enquiries.", "It was evidently intended by\r\nLeonardo himself as we conclude from incidental remarks in the MSS.", "(for instance No_ 110_).", "The fact that this arrangement was never\r\ncarried out either in the old MS.", "copies or in any edition since, is\r\neasily accounted for by the general disorder which results from the\r\nprovisional distribution of the various chapters in the old copies.", "We have every reason to believe that the earliest copyists, in\r\ndistributing the materials collected by them, did not in the least\r\nconsider the order in which the original MS.lay before them._\r\n\r\n_It is evident that almost all the chapters which refer to the\r\ncalling and life of the painter--and which are here brought together\r\nin the first section (Nos._ 482-508_)--may be referred to two\r\ndistinct periods in Leonardo's life; most of them can be dated as\r\nbelonging to the year_ 1492 _or to_ 1515.", "_At about this later time\r\nLeonardo may have formed the project of completing his Libro della\r\nPittura, after an interval of some years, as it would seem, during\r\nwhich his interest in the subject had fallen somewhat into the\r\nbackground._\r\n\r\n_In the second section, which treats first of the artist's studio,\r\nthe construction of a suitable window forms the object of careful\r\ninvestigations; the special importance attached to this by Leonardo\r\nis sufficiently obvious.", "His theory of the incidence of light which\r\nwas fully discussed in a former part of this work, was to him by no\r\nmeans of mere abstract value, but, being deduced, as he says, from\r\nexperience (or experiment) was required to prove its utility in\r\npractice.", "Connected with this we find suggestions for the choice of\r\na light with practical hints as to sketching a picture and some\r\nother precepts of a practical character which must come under\r\nconsideration in the course of completing the painting.", "In all this\r\nI have followed the same principle of arrangement in the text as was\r\ncarried out in the Theory of Painting, thus the suggestions for the\r\nPerspective of a picture, (Nos._ 536-569_), are followed by the\r\ntheory of light and shade for the practical method of optics (Nos._\r\n548--566_) and this by the practical precepts or the treatment of\r\naerial perspective (_567--570_)._\r\n\r\n_In the passage on Portrait and Figure Painting the principles of\r\npainting as applied to a bust and head are separated and placed\r\nfirst, since the advice to figure painters must have some connection\r\nwith the principles of the treatment of composition by which they\r\nare followed._\r\n\r\n_But this arrangement of the text made it seem advisable not to pick\r\nout the practical precepts as to the representation of trees and\r\nlandscape from the close connection in which they were originally\r\nplaced--unlike the rest of the practical precepts--with the theory\r\nof this branch of the subject.", "They must therefore be sought under\r\nthe section entitled Botany for Painters._\r\n\r\n_As a supplement to the_ Libro di Pittura _I have here added those\r\ntexts which treat of the Painter's materials,--as chalk, drawing\r\npaper, colours and their preparation, of the management of oils and\r\nvarnishes; in the appendix are some notes on chemical substances.", "Possibly some of these, if not all, may have stood in connection\r\nwith the preparation of colours."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_101", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 101)", "language": "it", "content": "It is in the very nature of things\r\nthat Leonardo's incidental indications as to colours and the like\r\nshould be now-a-days extremely obscure and could only be explained\r\nby professional experts--by them even in but few instances.

Many are they who have a taste and love for drawing, but no talent;\r\nand this will be discernible in boys who are not diligent and never\r\nfinish their drawings with shading. The course of instruction for an artist (483-485). 483. The youth should first learn perspective, then the proportions of\r\nobjects. Then he may copy from some good master, to accustom himself\r\nto fine forms. Then from nature, to confirm by practice the rules he\r\nhas learnt. Then see for a time the works of various masters. Then\r\nget the habit of putting his art into practice and work. [Footnote: The Vatican copy and numerous abridgements all place this\r\nchapter at the beginning of the _Trattato_, and in consequence\r\nDUFRESNE and all subsequent editors have done the same. In the\r\nVatican copy however all the general considerations on the relation\r\nof painting to the other arts are placed first, as introductory.]\r\n\r\n484. OF THE ORDER OF LEARNING TO DRAW. First draw from drawings by good masters done from works of art and\r\nfrom nature, and not from memory; then from plastic work, with the\r\nguidance of the drawing done from it; and then from good natural\r\nmodels and this you must put into practice. 485. PRECEPTS FOR DRAWING. The artist ought first to exercise his hand by copying drawings from\r\nthe hand of a good master. And having acquired that practice, under\r\nthe criticism of his master, he should next practise drawing objects\r\nin relief of a good style, following the rules which will presently\r\nbe given. The study of the antique (486. 487). 486. OF DRAWING. Which is best, to draw from nature or from the antique? and which is\r\nmore difficult to do outlines or light and shade? 487.

The question asked in No. 486 remains unanswered by him\r\nand it seems to me very doubtful whether the opinion stated in No. 487 is to be regarded as a reply to it. This opinion stands in the\r\nMS. in a connection--as will be explained later on--which seems to\r\nrequire us to limit its application to a single special case.

It seems to me that the drapery in a pen and ink\r\ndrawing of a bust, also at Windsor, has been borrowed from an\r\nantique model (Pl. XXX). G. G. Rossi has, I believe, correctly\r\ninterpreted Leonardo's feeling towards the antique in the following\r\nnote on this passage in manzi's edition, p. 501: \"Sappiamo dalla\r\nstoria, che i valorosi artisti Toscani dell'età dell'oro dell'arte\r\nstudiarono sugli antichi marmi raccolti dal Magnifico LORENZO DE'\r\nMEDICI.

OF PAINTING. It is indispensable to a Painter who would be thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the limbs in all the positions and actions of which they are\r\ncapable, in the nude, to know the anatomy of the sinews, bones,\r\nmuscles and tendons so that, in their various movements and\r\nexertions, he may know which nerve or muscle is the cause of each\r\nmovement and show those only as prominent and thickened, and not the\r\nothers all over [the limb], as many do who, to seem great\r\ndraughtsmen, draw their nude figures looking like wood, devoid of\r\ngrace; so that you would think you were looking at a sack of walnuts\r\nrather than the human form, or a bundle of radishes rather than the\r\nmuscles of figures. 489. HOW IT IS NECESSARY TO A PAINTER THAT HE SHOULD KNOW THE INTRINSIC\r\nFORMS [STRUCTURE] OF MAN. The painter who is familiar with the nature of the sinews, muscles,\r\nand tendons, will know very well, in giving movement to a limb, how\r\nmany and which sinews cause it; and which muscle, by swelling,\r\ncauses the contraction of that sinew; and which sinews, expanded\r\ninto the thinnest cartilage, surround and support the said muscle. Thus he will variously and constantly demonstrate the different\r\nmuscles by means of the various attitudes of his figures, and will\r\nnot do, as many who, in a variety of movements, still display the\r\nvery same things [modelling] in the arms, back, breast and legs. And\r\nthese things are not to be regarded as minor faults. How to acquire practice. 490. OF STUDY AND THE ORDER OF STUDY. I say that first you ought to learn the limbs and their mechanism,\r\nand having this knowledge, their actions should come next, according\r\nto the circumstances in which they occur in man. And thirdly to\r\ncompose subjects, the studies for which should be taken from natural\r\nactions and made from time to time, as circumstances allow; and pay\r\nattention to them in the streets and _piazze_ and fields, and note\r\nthem down with a brief indication of the forms; [Footnote 5: Lines\r\n5-7 explained by the lower portion of the sketch No. 1 on Pl. XXXI.]\r\nthus for a head make an o, and for an arm a straight or a bent line,\r\nand the same for the legs and the body, [Footnote 7: Lines 5-7\r\nexplained by the lower portion of the sketch No. 1 on Pl.

WHAT RULES SHOULD BE GIVEN TO BOYS LEARNING TO PAINT. We know for certain that sight is one of the most rapid actions we\r\ncan perform. In an instant we see an infinite number of forms, still\r\nwe only take in thoroughly one object at a time. Supposing that you,\r\nReader, were to glance rapidly at the whole of this written page,\r\nyou would instantly perceive that it was covered with various\r\nletters; but you could not, in the time, recognise what the letters\r\nwere, nor what they were meant to tell. Hence you would need to see\r\nthem word by word, line by line to be able to understand the\r\nletters. Again, if you wish to go to the top of a building you must\r\ngo up step by step; otherwise it will be impossible that you should\r\nreach the top. Thus I say to you, whom nature prompts to pursue this\r\nart, if you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects\r\nbegin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second\r\n[step] till you have the first well fixed in memory and in practice. And if you do otherwise you will throw away your time, or certainly\r\ngreatly prolong your studies. And remember to acquire diligence\r\nrather than rapidity. 492. HOW THAT DILIGENCE [ACCURACY] SHOULD FIRST BE LEARNT RATHER THAN\r\nRAPID EXECUTION. If you, who draw, desire to study well and to good purpose, always\r\ngo slowly to work in your drawing; and discriminate in. the lights,\r\nwhich have the highest degree of brightness, and to what extent and\r\nlikewise in the shadows, which are those that are darker than the\r\nothers and in what way they intermingle; then their masses and the\r\nrelative proportions of one to the other. And note in their\r\noutlines, which way they tend; and which part of the lines is curved\r\nto one side or the other, and where they are more or less\r\nconspicuous and consequently broad or fine; and finally, that your\r\nlight and shade blend without strokes and borders [but] looking like\r\nsmoke. And when you have thus schooled your hand and your judgment\r\nby such diligence, you will acquire rapidity before you are aware. The artist's private life and choice of company (493-494). 493. OF THE LIFE OF THE PAINTER IN THE COUNTRY. A painter needs such mathematics as belong to painting. And the\r\nabsence of all companions who are alienated from his studies; his\r\nbrain must be easily impressed by the variety of objects, which\r\nsuccessively come before him, and also free from other cares\r\n[Footnote 6: Leonardo here seems to be speaking of his own method of\r\nwork as displayed in his MSS. and this passage explains, at least in\r\npart, the peculiarities in their arrangement.]. And if, when\r\nconsidering and defining one subject, a second subject\r\nintervenes--as happens when an object occupies the mind, then he\r\nmust decide which of these cases is the more difficult to work out,\r\nand follow that up until it becomes quite clear, and then work out\r\nthe explanation of the other [Footnote 11: Leonardo here seems to be\r\nspeaking of his own method of work as displayed in his MSS. and this\r\npassage explains, at least in part, the peculiarities in their\r\narrangement.]. And above all he must keep his mind as clear as the\r\nsurface of a mirror, which assumes colours as various as those of\r\nthe different objects. And his companions should be like him as to\r\ntheir studies, and if such cannot be found he should keep his\r\nspeculations to himself alone, so that at last he will find no more\r\nuseful company [than his own].

The distribution of time for studying (495-497). 495. OF WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO DRAW WITH COMPANIONS OR NOT. I say and insist that drawing in company is much better than alone,\r\nfor many reasons. The first is that you would be ashamed to be seen\r\nbehindhand among the students, and such shame will lead you to\r\ncareful study. Secondly, a wholesome emulation will stimulate you to\r\nbe among those who are more praised than yourself, and this praise\r\nof others will spur you on. Another is that you can learn from the\r\ndrawings of others who do better than yourself; and if you are\r\nbetter than they, you can profit by your contempt for their defects,\r\nwhile the praise of others will incite you to farther merits. [Footnote: The contradiction by this passage of the foregoing\r\nchapter is only apparent. It is quite clear, from the nature of the\r\nreasoning which is here used to prove that it is more improving to\r\nwork with others than to work alone, that the studies of pupils only\r\nare under consideration here.]\r\n\r\n496. OF STUDYING, IN THE DARK, WHEN YOU WAKE, OR IN BED BEFORE YOU GO TO\r\nSLEEP. I myself have proved it to be of no small use, when in bed in the\r\ndark, to recall in fancy the external details of forms previously\r\nstudied, or other noteworthy things conceived by subtle speculation;\r\nand this is certainly an admirable exercise, and useful for\r\nimpressing things on the memory. 497. OF THE TIME FOR STUDYING SELECTION OF SUBJECTS. Winter evenings ought to be employed by young students in looking\r\nover the things prepared during the summer; that is, all the\r\ndrawings from the nude done in the summer should be brought together\r\nand a choice made of the best [studies of] limbs and bodies among\r\nthem, to apply in practice and commit to memory. OF POSITIONS. After this in the following summer you should select some one who is\r\nwell grown and who has not been brought up in doublets, and so may\r\nnot be of stiff carriage, and make him go through a number of agile\r\nand graceful actions; and if his muscles do not show plainly within\r\nthe outlines of his limbs that does not matter at all. It is enough\r\nthat you can see good attitudes and you can correct [the drawing of]\r\nthe limbs by those you studied in the winter.

Nor is the painter praiseworthy who does but one thing well, as the\r\nnude figure, heads, draperies, animals, landscapes or other such\r\ndetails, irrespective of other work; for there can be no mind so\r\ninept, that after devoting itself to one single thing and doing it\r\nconstantly, it should fail to do it well.", "sentences": ["To the end that well-being of the body may not injure that of the\r\nmind, the painter or draughtsman must remain solitary, and\r\nparticularly when intent on those studies and reflections which will\r\nconstantly rise up before his eye, giving materials to be well\r\nstored in the memory.", "While you are alone you are entirely your own\r\n[master] and if you have one companion you are but half your own,\r\nand the less so in proportion to the indiscretion of his behaviour.", "And if you have many companions you will fall deeper into the same\r\ntrouble.", "If you should say: \"I will go my own way and withdraw\r\napart, the better to study the forms of natural objects\", I tell\r\nyou, you will not be able to help often listening to their chatter.", "And so, since one cannot serve two masters, you will badly fill the\r\npart of a companion, and carry out your studies of art even worse.", "And if you say: \"I will withdraw so far that their words cannot\r\nreach me and they cannot disturb me\", I can tell you that you will\r\nbe thought mad.", "But, you see, you will at any rate be alone.", "And if\r\nyou must have companions ship find it in your studio.", "This may\r\nassist you to have the advantages which arise from various\r\nspeculations.", "All other company may be highly mischievous.", "The distribution of time for studying (495-497).", "495.", "OF WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO DRAW WITH COMPANIONS OR NOT.", "I say and insist that drawing in company is much better than alone,\r\nfor many reasons.", "The first is that you would be ashamed to be seen\r\nbehindhand among the students, and such shame will lead you to\r\ncareful study.", "Secondly, a wholesome emulation will stimulate you to\r\nbe among those who are more praised than yourself, and this praise\r\nof others will spur you on.", "Another is that you can learn from the\r\ndrawings of others who do better than yourself; and if you are\r\nbetter than they, you can profit by your contempt for their defects,\r\nwhile the praise of others will incite you to farther merits.", "[Footnote: The contradiction by this passage of the foregoing\r\nchapter is only apparent.", "It is quite clear, from the nature of the\r\nreasoning which is here used to prove that it is more improving to\r\nwork with others than to work alone, that the studies of pupils only\r\nare under consideration here.]\r\n\r\n496.", "OF STUDYING, IN THE DARK, WHEN YOU WAKE, OR IN BED BEFORE YOU GO TO\r\nSLEEP.", "I myself have proved it to be of no small use, when in bed in the\r\ndark, to recall in fancy the external details of forms previously\r\nstudied, or other noteworthy things conceived by subtle speculation;\r\nand this is certainly an admirable exercise, and useful for\r\nimpressing things on the memory.", "497.", "OF THE TIME FOR STUDYING SELECTION OF SUBJECTS.", "Winter evenings ought to be employed by young students in looking\r\nover the things prepared during the summer; that is, all the\r\ndrawings from the nude done in the summer should be brought together\r\nand a choice made of the best [studies of] limbs and bodies among\r\nthem, to apply in practice and commit to memory.", "OF POSITIONS.", "After this in the following summer you should select some one who is\r\nwell grown and who has not been brought up in doublets, and so may\r\nnot be of stiff carriage, and make him go through a number of agile\r\nand graceful actions; and if his muscles do not show plainly within\r\nthe outlines of his limbs that does not matter at all.", "It is enough\r\nthat you can see good attitudes and you can correct [the drawing of]\r\nthe limbs by those you studied in the winter.", "[Footnote: An injunction to study in the evening occurs also in No.", "524.]\r\n\r\nOn the productive power of minor artists (498-501).", "498.", "He is a poor disciple who does not excel his master.", "499.", "Nor is the painter praiseworthy who does but one thing well, as the\r\nnude figure, heads, draperies, animals, landscapes or other such\r\ndetails, irrespective of other work; for there can be no mind so\r\ninept, that after devoting itself to one single thing and doing it\r\nconstantly, it should fail to do it well."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_105", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 105)", "language": "it", "content": "[Footnote: In MANZI'S edition (p. 502) the painter G.

Bossi\r\nindignantly remarks on this passage. \"_Parla il Vince in questo\r\nluogo come se tutti gli artisti avessero quella sublimita d'ingegno\r\ncapace di abbracciare tutte le cose, di cui era egli dotato\"_ And he\r\nthen mentions the case of CLAUDE LORRAIN. But he overlooks the fact\r\nthat in Leonardo's time landscape painting made no pretensions to\r\nindependence but was reckoned among the details (_particulari_,\r\nlines 3, 4).]\r\n\r\n500. THAT A PAINTER IS NOT ADMIRABLE UNLESS HE IS UNIVERSAL. Some may distinctly assert that those persons are under a delusion\r\nwho call that painter a good master who can do nothing well but a\r\nhead or a figure. Certainly this is no great achievement; after\r\nstudying one single thing for a life-time who would not have\r\nattained some perfection in it? But, since we know that painting\r\nembraces and includes in itself every object produced by nature or\r\nresulting from the fortuitous actions of men, in short, all that the\r\neye can see, he seems to me but a poor master who can only do a\r\nfigure well. For do you not perceive how many and various actions\r\nare performed by men only; how many different animals there are, as\r\nwell as trees, plants, flowers, with many mountainous regions and\r\nplains, springs and rivers, cities with public and private\r\nbuildings, machines, too, fit for the purposes of men, divers\r\ncostumes, decorations and arts? And all these things ought to be\r\nregarded as of equal importance and value, by the man who can be\r\ntermed a good painter. 501. OF THE MISERABLE PRETENCES MADE BY THOSE WHO FALSELY AND UNWORTHILY\r\nACQUIRE THE NAME OF PAINTERS. Now there is a certain race of painters who, having studied but\r\nlittle, must need take as their standard of beauty mere gold and\r\nazure, and these, with supreme conceit, declare that they will not\r\ngive good work for miserable payment, and that they could do as well\r\nas any other if they were well paid. But, ye foolish folks! cannot\r\nsuch artists keep some good work, and then say: this is a costly\r\nwork and this more moderate and this is average work and show that\r\nthey can work at all prices? A caution against one-sided study. 502. HOW, IN IMPORTANT WORKS, A MAN SHOULD NOT TRUST ENTIRELY TO HIS\r\nMEMORY WITHOUT CONDESCENDING TO DRAW FROM NATURE. Any master who should venture to boast that he could remember all\r\nthe forms and effects of nature would certainly appear to me to be\r\ngraced with extreme ignorance, inasmuch as these effects are\r\ninfinite and our memory is not extensive enough to retain them. Hence, O! painter, beware lest the lust of gain should supplant in\r\nyou the dignity of art; for the acquisition of glory is a much\r\ngreater thing than the glory of riches. Hence, for these and other\r\nreasons which might be given, first strive in drawing to represent\r\nyour intention to the eye by expressive forms, and the idea\r\noriginally formed in your imagination; then go on taking out or\r\nputting in, until you have satisfied yourself. Then have living men,\r\ndraped or nude, as you may have purposed in your work, and take care\r\nthat in dimensions and size, as determined by perspective, nothing\r\nis left in the work which is not in harmony with reason and the\r\neffects in nature. And this will be the way to win honour in your\r\nart. How to acquire universality (503-506). 503. OF VARIETY IN THE FIGURES. The painter should aim at universality, because there is a great\r\nwant of self-respect in doing one thing well and another badly, as\r\nmany do who study only the [rules of] measure and proportion in the\r\nnude figure and do not seek after variety; for a man may be well\r\nproportioned, or he may be fat and short, or tall and thin, or\r\nmedium. And a painter who takes no account of these varieties always\r\nmakes his figures on one pattern so that they might all be taken for\r\nbrothers; and this is a defect that demands stern reprehension. 504.

OF THE MEANS OF ACQUIRING UNIVERSALITY. It is an easy matter to men to acquire universality, for all\r\nterrestrial animals resemble each other as to their limbs, that is\r\nin their muscles, sinews and bones; and they do not vary excepting\r\nin length or in thickness, as will be shown under Anatomy. But then\r\nthere are aquatic animals which are of great variety; I will not try\r\nto convince the painter that there is any rule for them for they are\r\nof infinite variety, and so is the insect tribe. 506. PAINTING. The mind of the painter must resemble a mirror, which always takes\r\nthe colour of the object it reflects and is completely occupied by\r\nthe images of as many objects as are in front of it. Therefore you\r\nmust know, Oh Painter! that you cannot be a good one if you are not\r\nthe universal master of representing by your art every kind of form\r\nproduced by nature. And this you will not know how to do if you do\r\nnot see them, and retain them in your mind. Hence as you go through\r\nthe fields, turn your attention to various objects, and, in turn\r\nlook now at this thing and now at that, collecting a store of divers\r\nfacts selected and chosen from those of less value. But do not do\r\nlike some painters who, when they are wearied with exercising their\r\nfancy dismiss their work from their thoughts and take exercise in\r\nwalking for relaxation, but still keep fatigue in their mind which,\r\nthough they see various objects [around them], does not apprehend\r\nthem; but, even when they meet friends or relations and are saluted\r\nby them, although they see and hear them, take no more cognisance of\r\nthem than if they had met so much empty air. Useful games and exercises (507. 508). 507. OF GAMES TO BE PLAYED BY THOSE WHO DRAW. When, Oh draughtsmen, you desire to find relaxation in games you\r\nshould always practise such things as may be of use in your\r\nprofession, by giving your eye good practice in judging accurately\r\nof the breadth and length of objects. Thus, to accustom your mind to\r\nsuch things, let one of you draw a straight line at random on a\r\nwall, and each of you, taking a blade of grass or of straw in his\r\nhand, try to cut it to the length that the line drawn appears to him\r\nto be, standing at a distance of 10 braccia; then each one may go up\r\nto the line to measure the length he has judged it to be. And he who\r\nhas come nearest with his measure to the length of the pattern is\r\nthe best man, and the winner, and shall receive the prize you have\r\nsettled beforehand. Again you should take forshortened measures:\r\nthat is take a spear, or any other cane or reed, and fix on a point\r\nat a certain distance; and let each one estimate how many times he\r\njudges that its length will go into that distance. Again, who will\r\ndraw best a line one braccio long, which shall be tested by a\r\nthread. And such games give occasion to good practice for the eye,\r\nwhich is of the first importance in painting. 508. A WAY OF DEVELOPING AND AROUSING THE MIND TO VARIOUS INVENTIONS. I cannot forbear to mention among these precepts a new device for\r\nstudy which, although it may seem but trivial and almost ludicrous,\r\nis nevertheless extremely useful in arousing the mind to various\r\ninventions. And this is, when you look at a wall spotted with\r\nstains, or with a mixture of stones, if you have to devise some\r\nscene, you may discover a resemblance to various landscapes,\r\nbeautified with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide\r\nvalleys and hills in varied arrangement; or again you may see\r\nbattles and figures in action; or strange faces and costumes, and an\r\nendless variety of objects, which you could reduce to complete and\r\nwell drawn forms. And these appear on such walls confusedly, like\r\nthe sound of bells in whose jangle you may find any name or word you\r\nchoose to imagine.

OF THE PAINTER'S WINDOW AND ITS ADVANTAGE. The painter who works from nature should have a window, which he can\r\nraise and lower. The reason is that sometimes you will want to\r\nfinish a thing you are drawing, close to the light. Let _a b c d_ be the chest on which the work may be raised or\r\nlowered, so that the work moves up and down and not the painter. And\r\nevery evening you can let down the work and shut it up above so that\r\nin the evening it may be in the fashion of a chest which, when shut\r\nup, may serve the purpose of a bench. [Footnote: See Pl. XXXI, No. 2. In this plate the lines have\r\nunfortunately lost their sharpness, for the accidental loss of the\r\nnegative has necessitated a reproduction from a positive. But having\r\nformerly published this sketch by another process, in VON LUTZOW'S\r\n_Zeitschrift fur bildende Kunst_ (Vol. XVII, pg. 13) I have\r\nreproduced it here in the text. The sharpness of the outline in the\r\noriginal sketch is here preserved but it gives it from the reversed\r\nside.]\r\n\r\nOn the best light for painting (513-520). 513. Which light is best for drawing from nature; whether high or low, or\r\nlarge or small, or strong and broad, or strong and small, or broad\r\nand weak or small and weak? [Footnote: The question here put is unanswered in the original MS.]\r\n\r\n514. OF THE QUALITY OF THE LIGHT. A broad light high up and not too strong will render the details of\r\nobjects very agreeable. 515. THAT THE LIGHT FOR DRAWING FROM NATURE SHOULD BE HIGH UP. The light for drawing from nature should come from the North in\r\norder that it may not vary. And if you have it from the South, keep\r\nthe window screened with cloth, so that with the sun shining the\r\nwhole day the light may not vary. The height of the light should be\r\nso arranged as that every object shall cast a shadow on the ground\r\nof the same length as itself. 516. THE KIND OF LIGHT REQUISITE FOR PAINTING LIGHT AND SHADE. An object will display the greatest difference of light and shade\r\nwhen it is seen in the strongest light, as by sunlight, or, at\r\nnight, by the light of a fire. But this should not be much used in\r\npainting because the works remain crude and ungraceful. An object seen in a moderate light displays little difference in the\r\nlight and shade; and this is the case towards evening or when the\r\nday is cloudy, and works then painted are tender and every kind of\r\nface becomes graceful. Thus, in every thing extremes are to be\r\navoided: Too much light gives crudeness; too little prevents our\r\nseeing. The medium is best. OF SMALL LIGHTS. Again, lights cast from a small window give strong differences of\r\nlight and shade, all the more if the room lighted by it be large,\r\nand this is not good for painting. 517. PAINTING. The luminous air which enters by passing through orifices in walls\r\ninto dark rooms will render the place less dark in proportion as the\r\nopening cuts into the walls which surround and cover in the\r\npavement. 518.

A similar semicircle, Pl III, No. 2\r\n(and compare No. 149) is expressly called '_orizonte_' in writing.]\r\n\r\n519. That the light should fall upon a picture from one window only. This\r\nmay be seen in the case of objects in this form. If you want to\r\nrepresent a round ball at a certain height you must make it oval in\r\nthis shape, and stand so far off as that by foreshortening it\r\nappears round. 520. OF SELECTING THE LIGHT WHICH GIVES MOST GRACE TO FACES. If you should have a court yard that you can at pleasure cover with\r\na linen awning that light will be good. Or when you want to take a\r\nportrait do it in dull weather, or as evening falls, making the\r\nsitter stand with his back to one of the walls of the court yard. Note in the streets, as evening falls, the faces of the men and\r\nwomen, and when the weather is dull, what softness and delicacy you\r\nmay perceive in them. Hence, Oh Painter! have a court arranged with\r\nthe walls tinted black and a narrow roof projecting within the\r\nwalls. It should be 10 braccia wide and 20 braccia long and 10\r\nbraccia high and covered with a linen awning; or else paint a work\r\ntowards evening or when it is cloudy or misty, and this is a perfect\r\nlight. On various helps in preparing a picture (521-530). 521. To draw a nude figure from nature, or any thing else, hold in your\r\nhand a plumb-line to enable you to judge of the relative position\r\nof objects. 522. OF DRAWING AN OBJECT. When you draw take care to set up a principal line which you must\r\nobserve all throughout the object you are drawing; every thing\r\nshould bear relation to the direction of this principal line. 523. OF A MODE OF DRAWING A PLACE ACCURATELY. Have a piece of glass as large as a half sheet of royal folio paper\r\nand set thus firmly in front of your eyes that is, between your eye\r\nand the thing you want to draw; then place yourself at a distance of\r\n2/3 of a braccia from the glass fixing your head with a machine in\r\nsuch a way that you cannot move it at all. Then shut or entirely\r\ncover one eye and with a brush or red chalk draw upon the glass that\r\nwhich you see beyond it; then trace it on paper from the glass,\r\nafterwards transfer it onto good paper, and paint it if you like,\r\ncarefully attending to the arial perspective. HOW TO LEARN TO PLACE YOUR FIGURES CORRECTLY. If you want to acquire a practice of good and correct attitudes for\r\nyour figures, make a square frame or net, and square it out with\r\nthread; place this between your eye and the nude model you are\r\ndrawing, and draw these same squares on the paper on which you mean\r\nto draw the figure, but very delicately. Then place a pellet of wax\r\non a spot of the net which will serve as a fixed point, which,\r\nwhenever you look at your model, must cover the pit of the throat;\r\nor, if his back is turned, it may cover one of the vertebrae of the\r\nneck.", "sentences": ["In proportion to the number of times that _a b_ goes into _c d_ will\r\nit be more luminous than _c d_.", "And similarly, in proportion as the\r\npoint _e_ goes into _c d_ will it be more luminous than _c d;_ and\r\nthis light is useful for carvers of delicate work.", "[Footnote 5: For\r\nthe same reason a window thus constructed would be convenient for an\r\nilluminator or a miniature painter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: M.", "RAVAISSON in his edition of the Paris MS.", "A remarks on\r\nthis passage: _\"La figure porte les lettres_ f _et_ g, _auxquelles\r\nrien ne renvoie dans l'explication;

Why are paintings seen more correctly in a mirror than out of it? 529. HOW THE MIRROR IS THE MASTER [AND GUIDE] OF PAINTERS. When you want to see if your picture corresponds throughout with the\r\nobjects you have drawn from nature, take a mirror and look in that\r\nat the reflection of the real things, and compare the reflected\r\nimage with your picture, and consider whether the subject of the two\r\nimages duly corresponds in both, particularly studying the mirror. You should take the mirror for your guide--that is to say a flat\r\nmirror--because on its surface the objects appear in many respects\r\nas in a painting. Thus you see, in a painting done on a flat\r\nsurface, objects which appear in relief, and in the mirror--also a\r\nflat surface--they look the same. The picture has one plane surface\r\nand the same with the mirror. The picture is intangible, in so far\r\nas that which appears round and prominent cannot be grasped in the\r\nhands; and it is the same with the mirror. And since you can see\r\nthat the mirror, by means of outlines, shadows and lights, makes\r\nobjects appear in relief, you, who have in your colours far stronger\r\nlights and shades than those in the mirror, can certainly, if you\r\ncompose your picture well, make that also look like a natural scene\r\nreflected in a large mirror. [Footnote: I understand the concluding lines of this passage as\r\nfollows: If you draw the upper half a figure on a large sheet of\r\npaper laid out on the floor of a room (_sala be piana_) to the same\r\nscale (_con le sue vere grosseze_) as the lower half, already drawn\r\nupon the wall (lines 10, 11)you must then reduce them on a '_pariete\r\ndi rilievo_,' a curved vertical plane which serves as a model to\r\nreproduce the form of the vault.]\r\n\r\n530.

Again, it\r\nis well that you should often leave off work and take a little\r\nrelaxation, because, when you come back to it you are a better\r\njudge; for sitting too close at work may greatly deceive you.

On the management of works (531. 532). 531. OF A METHOD OF LEARNING WELL BY HEART. When you want to know a thing you have studied in your memory\r\nproceed in this way: When you have drawn the same thing so many\r\ntimes that you think you know it by heart, test it by drawing it\r\nwithout the model; but have the model traced on flat thin glass and\r\nlay this on the drawing you have made without the model, and note\r\ncarefully where the tracing does not coincide with your drawing, and\r\nwhere you find you have gone wrong; and bear in mind not to repeat\r\nthe same mistakes. Then return to the model, and draw the part in\r\nwhich you were wrong again and again till you have it well in your\r\nmind. If you have no flat glass for tracing on, take some very thin\r\nkidts-kin parchment, well oiled and dried. And when you have used it\r\nfor one drawing you can wash it clean with a sponge and make a\r\nsecond. 532. THAT A PAINTER OUGHT TO BE CURIOUS TO HEAR THE OPINIONS OF EVERY ONE\r\nON HIS WORK. Certainly while a man is painting he ought not to shrink from\r\nhearing every opinion. For we know very well that a man, though he\r\nmay not be a painter, is familiar with the forms of other men and\r\nvery capable of judging whether they are hump backed, or have one\r\nshoulder higher or lower than the other, or too big a mouth or nose,\r\nand other defects; and, as we know that men are competent to judge\r\nof the works of nature, how much more ought we to admit that they\r\ncan judge of our errors; since you know how much a man may be\r\ndeceived in his own work. And if you are not conscious of this in\r\nyourself study it in others and profit by their faults. Therefore be\r\ncurious to hear with patience the opinions of others, consider and\r\nweigh well whether those who find fault have ground or not for\r\nblame, and, if so amend; but, if not make as though you had not\r\nheard, or if he should be a man you esteem show him by argument the\r\ncause of his mistake. On the limitations of painting (533-535)\r\n\r\n533. HOW IN SMALL OBJECTS ERRORS ARE LESS EVIDENT THAN IN LARGE ONES. In objects of minute size the extent of error is not so perceptible\r\nas in large ones; and the reason is that if this small object is a\r\nrepresentation of a man or of some other animal, from the immense\r\ndiminution the details cannot be worked out by the artist with the\r\nfinish that is requisite.

Painters often fall into despair of imitating nature when they see\r\ntheir pictures fail in that relief and vividness which objects have\r\nthat are seen in a mirror; while they allege that they have colours\r\nwhich for brightness or depth far exceed the strength of light and\r\nshade in the reflections in the mirror, thus displaying their own\r\nignorance rather than the real cause, because they do not know it. It is impossible that painted objects should appear in such relief\r\nas to resemble those reflected in the mirror, although both are seen\r\non a flat surface, unless they are seen with only one eye; and the\r\nreason is that two eyes see one object behind another as _a_ and _b_\r\nsee _m_ and _n_. _m_ cannot exactly occupy [the space of] _n_\r\nbecause the base of the visual lines is so broad that the second\r\nbody is seen beyond the first. But if you close one eye, as at _s_\r\nthe body _f_ will conceal _r_, because the line of sight proceeds\r\nfrom a single point and makes its base in the first body, whence the\r\nsecond, of the same size, can never be seen. [Footnote: This passage contains the solution of the problem\r\nproposed in No. 29, lines 10-14. Leonardo was evidently familiar\r\nwith the law of optics on which the construction of the stereoscope\r\ndepends. Compare E. VON BRUCKE, _Bruchstucke aus der Theorie der\r\nbildenden Kunste_, pg. 69: \"_Schon Leonardo da Vinci wusste, dass\r\nein noch so gut gemaltes Bild nie den vollen Eindruck der\r\nKorperlichkeit geben kann, wie ihn die Natur selbst giebt.

WHY OF TWO OBJECTS OF EQUAL SIZE A PAINTED ONE WILL LOOK LARGER THAN\r\nA SOLID ONE. The reason of this is not so easy to demonstrate as many others. Still I will endeavour to accomplish it, if not wholly, at any rate\r\nin part. The perspective of diminution demonstrates by reason, that\r\nobjects diminish in proportion as they are farther from the eye, and\r\nthis reasoning is confirmed by experience. Hence, the lines of sight\r\nthat extend between the object and the eye, when they are directed\r\nto the surface of a painting are all intersected at uniform limits,\r\nwhile those lines which are directed towards a piece of sculpture\r\nare intersected at various limits and are of various lengths. The\r\nlines which are longest extend to a more remote limb than the others\r\nand therefore that limb looks smaller. As there are numerous lines\r\neach longer than the others--since there are numerous parts, each\r\nmore remote than the others and these, being farther off,\r\nnecessarily appear smaller, and by appearing smaller it follows that\r\ntheir diminution makes the whole mass of the object look smaller. But this does not occur in painting; since the lines of sight all\r\nend at the same distance there can be no diminution, hence the parts\r\nnot being diminished the whole object is undiminished, and for this\r\nreason painting does not diminish, as a piece of sculpture does.

OF THE WAY TO DRAW FIGURES FOR HISTORICAL PICTURES. The painter must always study on the wall on which he is to picture\r\na story the height of the position where he wishes to arrange his\r\nfigures; and when drawing his studies for them from nature he must\r\nplace himself with his eye as much below the object he is drawing\r\nas, in the picture, it will have to be above the eye of the\r\nspectator.

You must make the foremost figure in the picture less than the size\r\nof nature in proportion to the number of braccia at which you place\r\nit from the front line, and make the others in proportion by the\r\nabove rule. 539. PERSPECTIVE. You are asked, O Painter, why the figures you draw on a small scale\r\naccording to the laws of perspective do not appear--notwithstanding\r\nthe demonstration of distance--as large as real ones--their height\r\nbeing the same as in those painted on the wall. And why [painted] objects seen at a small distance appear larger\r\nthan the real ones? The right position of the artist, when painting, and of the\r\nspectator (540-547)\r\n\r\n540. OF PAINTING. When you draw from nature stand at a distance of 3 times the height\r\nof the object you wish to draw. 541. OF DRAWING FROM RELIEF. In drawing from the round the draughtsman should so place himself\r\nthat the eye of the figure he is drawing is on a level with his own. This should be done with any head he may have to represent from\r\nnature because, without exception, the figures or persons you meet\r\nin the streets have their eyes on the same level as your own; and if\r\nyou place them higher or lower you will see that your drawing will\r\nnot be true. 542. WHY GROUPS OF FIGURES ONE ABOVE ANOTHER ARE TO BE AVOIDED. The universal practice which painters adopt on the walls of chapels\r\nis greatly and reasonably to be condemned. Inasmuch as they\r\nrepresent one historical subject on one level with a landscape and\r\nbuildings, and then go up a step and paint another, varying the\r\npoint [of sight], and then a third and a fourth, in such a way as\r\nthat on one wall there are 4 points of sight, which is supreme folly\r\nin such painters. We know that the point of sight is opposite the\r\neye of the spectator of the scene; and if you would [have me] tell\r\nyou how to represent the life of a saint divided into several\r\npictures on one and the same wall, I answer that you must set out\r\nthe foreground with its point of sight on a level with the eye of\r\nthe spectator of the scene, and upon this plane represent the more\r\nimportant part of the story large and then, diminishing by degrees\r\nthe figures, and the buildings on various hills and open spaces, you\r\ncan represent all the events of the history. And on the remainder of\r\nthe wall up to the top put trees, large as compared with the\r\nfigures, or angels if they are appropriate to the story, or birds or\r\nclouds or similar objects; otherwise do not trouble yourself with it\r\nfor your whole work will be wrong. 543. A PICTURE OF OBJECTS IN PERSPECTIVE WILL LOOK MORE LIFELIKE WHEN\r\nSEEN FROM THE POINT FROM WHICH THE OBJECTS WERE DRAWN. If you want to represent an object near to you which is to have the\r\neffect of nature, it is impossible that your perspective should not\r\nlook wrong, with every false relation and disagreement of proportion\r\nthat can be imagined in a wretched work, unless the spectator, when\r\nhe looks at it, has his eye at the very distance and height and\r\ndirection where the eye or the point of sight was placed in doing\r\nthis perspective.", "sentences": ["The point of sight must be at the level of the eye of an ordinary\r\nman, and the farthest limit of the plain where it touches the sky\r\nmust be placed at the level of that line where the earth and sky\r\nmeet;

If you want the proof briefly shown, take a piece of wood in the\r\nform of a little column, eight times as high as it is thick, like a\r\ncolumn without any plinth or capital; then mark off on a flat wall\r\n40 equal spaces, equal to its width so that between them they make\r\n40 columns resembling your little column; you then must fix,\r\nopposite the centre space, and at 4 braccia from the wall, a thin\r\nstrip of iron with a small round hole in the middle about as large\r\nas a big pearl.

A diminished object should be seen from the same distance, height\r\nand direction as the point of sight of your eye, or else your\r\nknowledge will produce no good effect. And if you will not, or cannot, act on this principle--because as\r\nthe plane on which you paint is to be seen by several persons you\r\nwould need several points of sight which would make it look\r\ndiscordant and wrong--place yourself at a distance of at least 10\r\ntimes the size of the objects. The lesser fault you can fall into then, will be that of\r\nrepresenting all the objects in the foreground of their proper size,\r\nand on whichever side you are standing the objects thus seen will\r\ndiminish themselves while the spaces between them will have no\r\ndefinite ratio. For, if you place yourself in the middle of a\r\nstraight row [of objects], and look at several columns arranged in a\r\nline you will see, beyond a few columns separated by intervals, that\r\nthe columns touch; and beyond where they touch they cover each\r\nother, till the last column projects but very little beyond the last\r\nbut one. Thus the spaces between the columns are by degrees entirely\r\nlost. So, if your method of perspective is good, it will produce the\r\nsame effect; this effect results from standing near the line in\r\nwhich the columns are placed. This method is not satisfactory unless\r\nthe objects seen are viewed from a small hole, in the middle of\r\nwhich is your point of sight; but if you proceed thus your work will\r\nbe perfect and will deceive the beholder, who will see the columns\r\nas they are here figured. Here the eye is in the middle, at the point _a_ and near to the\r\ncolumns.

WHERE A SPECTATOR SHOULD STAND TO LOOK AT A PICTURE. Supposing _a b_ to be the picture and _d_ to be the light, I say\r\nthat if you place yourself between _c_ and _e_ you will not\r\nunderstand the picture well and particularly if it is done in oils,\r\nor still more if it is varnished, because it will be lustrous and\r\nsomewhat of the nature of a mirror. And for this reason the nearer\r\nyou go towards the point _c_, the less you will see, because the\r\nrays of light falling from the window on the picture are reflected\r\nto that point. But if you place yourself between _e_ and _d_ you\r\nwill get a good view of it, and the more so as you approach the\r\npoint _d_, because that spot is least exposed to these reflected\r\nrays of light. III. THE PRACTICAL METHODS OF LIGHT AND SHADE AND AERIAL PERSPECTIVE. Gradations of light and shade. 548. OF PAINTING: OF THE DARKNESS OF THE SHADOWS, OR I MAY SAY, THE\r\nBRIGHTNESS OF THE LIGHTS. Although practical painters attribute to all shaded objects--trees,\r\nfields, hair, beards and skin--four degrees of darkness in each\r\ncolour they use: that is to say first a dark foundation, secondly a\r\nspot of colour somewhat resembling the form of the details, thirdly\r\na somewhat brighter and more defined portion, fourthly the lights\r\nwhich are more conspicuous than other parts of the figure; still to\r\nme it appears that these gradations are infinite upon a continuous\r\nsurface which is in itself infinitely divisible, and I prove it\r\nthus:--[Footnote 7: See Pl.

THAT SHADOWS CAST BY A PARTICULAR LIGHT SHOULD BE AVOIDED, BECAUSE\r\nTHEY ARE EQUALLY STRONG AT THE ENDS AND AT THE BEGINNING.

And the shadows are of equal strength at the end and at the\r\nbeginning. 551. HOW LIGHT SHOULD BE THROWN UPON FIGURES. The light must be arranged in accordance with the natural conditions\r\nunder which you wish to represent your figures: that is, if you\r\nrepresent them in the sunshine make the shadows dark with large\r\nspaces of light, and mark their shadows and those of all the\r\nsurrounding objects strongly on the ground. And if you represent\r\nthem as in dull weather give little difference of light and shade,\r\nwithout any shadows at their feet. If you represent them as within\r\ndoors, make a strong difference between the lights and shadows, with\r\nshadows on the ground. If the window is screened and the walls\r\nwhite, there will be little difference of light. If it is lighted by\r\nfirelight make the high lights ruddy and strong, and the shadows\r\ndark, and those cast on the walls and on the floor will be clearly\r\ndefined and the farther they are from the body the broader and\r\nlonger will they be. If the light is partly from the fire and partly\r\nfrom the outer day, that of day will be the stronger and that of the\r\nfire almost as red as fire itself. Above all see that the figures\r\nyou paint are broadly lighted and from above, that is to say all\r\nliving persons that you paint; for you will see that all the people\r\nyou meet out in the street are lighted from above, and you must know\r\nthat if you saw your most intimate friend with a light [on his face]\r\nfrom below you would find it difficult to recognise him. 552. OF HELPING THE APPARENT RELIEF OF A PICTURE BY GIVING IT ARTIFICIAL\r\nLIGHT AND SHADE. To increase relief of a picture you may place, between your figure\r\nand the solid object on which its shadow falls, a line of bright\r\nlight, dividing the figure from the object in shadow. And on the\r\nsame object you shall represent two light parts which will surround\r\nthe shadow cast upon the wall by the figure placed opposite [6]; and\r\ndo this frequently with the limbs which you wish should stand out\r\nsomewhat from the body they belong to; particularly when the arms\r\ncross the front of the breast show, between the shadow cast by the\r\narms on the breast and the shadow on the arms themselves, a little\r\nlight seeming to fall through a space between the breast and the\r\narms; and the more you wish the arm to look detached from the breast\r\nthe broader you must make the light; always contrive also to arrange\r\nthe figures against the background in such a way as that the parts\r\nin shadow are against a light background and the illuminated\r\nportions against a dark background. [Footnote 6: Compare the two diagrams under No. 565.]\r\n\r\n553. OF SITUATION. Remember [to note] the situation of your figures; for the light and\r\nshade will be one thing if the object is in a dark place with a\r\nparticular light, and another thing if it is in a light place with\r\ndirect sunlight; one thing in a dark place with a diffused evening\r\nlight or a cloudy sky, and another in the diffused light of the\r\natmosphere lighted by the sun. 554.

Those which are in the middle of the picture are\r\nsurrounded by shadows, because they are shaded by the figures which\r\nstand between them and the light. And those are lighted on one side\r\nonly which stand between the principal group and the light, because\r\nwhere they do not look towards the light they face the group and the\r\ndarkness of the group is thrown on them: and where they do not face\r\nthe group they face the brilliant light and it is their own darkness\r\nshadowing them, which appears there.

Thirdly, whether the figures are\r\nactively intent on their particular business. 555. OF THE TREATMENT OF THE LIGHTS. First give a general shadow to the whole of that extended part which\r\nis away from the light. Then put in the half shadows and the strong\r\nshadows, comparing them with each other and, in the same way give\r\nthe extended light in half tint, afterwards adding the half lights\r\nand the high lights, likewise comparing them together. The distribution of light and shade (556-559)\r\n\r\n556. OF SHADOWS ON BODIES. When you represent the dark shadows in bodies in light and shade,\r\nalways show the cause of the shadow, and the same with reflections;\r\nbecause the dark shadows are produced by dark objects and the\r\nreflections by objects only moderately lighted, that is with\r\ndiminished light. And there is the same proportion between the\r\nhighly lighted part of a body and the part lighted by a reflection\r\nas between the origin of the lights on the body and the origin of\r\nthe reflections. 557. OF LIGHTS AND SHADOWS. I must remind you to take care that every portion of a body, and\r\nevery smallest detail which is ever so little in relief, must be\r\ngiven its proper importance as to light and shade. 558. OF THE WAY TO MAKE THE SHADOW ON FIGURES CORRESPOND TO THE LIGHT AND\r\nTO [THE COLOUR] OF THE BODY. When you draw a figure and you wish to see whether the shadow is the\r\nproper complement to the light, and neither redder nor yellower than\r\nis the nature of the colour you wish to represent in shade, proceed\r\nthus. Cast a shadow with your finger on the illuminated portion, and\r\nif the accidental shadow that you have made is like the natural\r\nshadow cast by your finger on your work, well and good; and by\r\nputting your finger nearer or farther off, you can make darker or\r\nlighter shadows, which you must compare with your own. 559. OF SURROUNDING BODIES BY VARIOUS FORMS OF SHADOW. Take care that the shadows cast upon the surface of the bodies by\r\ndifferent objects must undulate according to the various curves of\r\nthe limbs which cast the shadows, and of the objects on which they\r\nare cast. The juxtaposition of light and shade (560, 561). 560. ON PAINTING. The comparison of the various qualities of shadows and lights not\r\ninfrequently seems ambiguous and confused to the painter who desires\r\nto imitate and copy the objects he sees. The reason is this: If you\r\nsee a white drapery side by side with a black one, that part of the\r\nwhite drapery which lies against the black one will certainly look\r\nmuch whiter than the part which lies against something whiter than\r\nitself. [Footnote: It is evident from this that so early as in 1492\r\nLeonardo's writing in perspective was so far advanced that he could\r\nquote his own statements.--As bearing on this subject compare what\r\nis said in No. 280.] And the reason of this is shown in my [book on]\r\nperspective. 561.

Place the\r\nmost highly coloured part between the light and shadow. And to see\r\nwhat shadow tint is needed on the flesh, cast a shadow on it with\r\nyour finger, and according as you wish to see it lighter or darker\r\nhold your finger nearer to or farther from your picture, and copy\r\nthat [shadow]. On the lighting of the background (562-565). 562. OF THE BACKGROUNDS FOR PAINTED FIGURES. The ground which surrounds the forms of any object you paint should\r\nbe darker than the high lights of those figures, and lighter than\r\ntheir shadowed part: &c. 563. OF THE BACKGROUND THAT THE PAINTER SHOULD ADOPT IN HIS WORKS. Since experience shows us that all bodies are surrounded by light\r\nand shade it is necessary that you, O Painter, should so arrange\r\nthat the side which is in light shall terminate against a dark body\r\nand likewise that the shadow side shall terminate against a light\r\nbody. And by [following] this rule you will add greatly to the\r\nrelief of your figures. 564. A most important part of painting consists in the backgrounds of the\r\nobjects represented; against these backgrounds the outlines of\r\nthose natural objects which are convex are always visible, and also\r\nthe forms of these bodies against the background, even though the\r\ncolours of the bodies should be the same as that of the background. This is caused by the convex edges of the objects not being\r\nilluminated in the same way as, by the same light, the background is\r\nilluminated, since these edges will often be lighter or darker than\r\nthe background. But if the edge is of the same colour as the\r\nbackground, beyond a doubt it will in that part of the picture\r\ninterfere with your perception of the outline, and such a choice in\r\na picture ought to be rejected by the judgment of good painters,\r\ninasmuch as the purpose of the painter is to make his figures appear\r\ndetached from the background; while in the case here described the\r\ncontrary occurs, not only in the picture, but in the objects\r\nthemselves. 565. That you ought, when representing objects above the eye and on one\r\nside--if you wish them to look detached from the wall--to show,\r\nbetween the shadow on the object and the shadow it casts a middle\r\nlight, so that the body will appear to stand away from the wall. On the lighting of white objects. 566. HOW WHITE BODIES SHOULD BE REPRESENTED. If you are representing a white body let it be surrounded by ample\r\nspace, because as white has no colour of its own, it is tinged and\r\naltered in some degree by the colour of the objects surrounding it. If you see a woman dressed in white in the midst of a landscape,\r\nthat side which is towards the sun is bright in colour, so much so\r\nthat in some portions it will dazzle the eyes like the sun itself;\r\nand the side which is towards the atmosphere,--luminous through\r\nbeing interwoven with the sun's rays and penetrated by them--since\r\nthe atmosphere itself is blue, that side of the woman's figure will\r\nappear steeped in blue.

Having, also, to be\r\ntransmitted from the surface to the sense through a dark medium,\r\nthat is to say the crystalline lens which looks dark, this image,\r\nnot being strong in colour becomes affected by this darkness on its\r\npassage, and on reaching the sense it appears dark; no other reason\r\ncan in any way be assigned. If the point in the eye is black, it is\r\nbecause it is full of a transparent humour as clear as air and acts\r\nlike a perforation in a board; on looking into it it appears dark\r\nand the objects seen through the bright air and a dark one become\r\nconfused in this darkness. WHY A MAN SEEN AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE IS NOT RECOGNISABLE. The perspective of diminution shows us that the farther away an\r\nobject is the smaller it looks. If you look at a man at a distance\r\nfrom you of an arrow's flight, and hold the eye of a small needle\r\nclose to your own eye, you can see through it several men whose\r\nimages are transmitted to the eye and will all be comprised within\r\nthe size of the needle's eye; hence, if the man who is at the\r\ndistance of an arrow's flight can send his whole image to your eye,\r\noccupying only a small space in the needle's eye how can you\r\n[expect] in so small a figure to distinguish or see the nose or\r\nmouth or any detail of his person? and, not seeing these you cannot\r\nrecognise the man, since these features, which he does not show, are\r\nwhat give men different aspects. 568. THE REASON WHY SMALL FIGURES SHOULD NOT BE MADE FINISHED. I say that the reason that objects appear diminished in size is\r\nbecause they are remote from the eye; this being the case it is\r\nevident that there must be a great extent of atmosphere between the\r\neye and the objects, and this air interferes with the distinctness\r\nof the forms of the object. Hence the minute details of these\r\nobjects will be indistinguishable and unrecognisable. Therefore, O\r\nPainter, make your smaller figures merely indicated and not highly\r\nfinished, otherwise you will produce effects the opposite to nature,\r\nyour supreme guide. The object is small by reason of the great\r\ndistance between it and the eye, this great distance is filled with\r\nair, that mass of air forms a dense body which intervenes and\r\nprevents the eye seeing the minute details of objects. 569. Whenever a figure is placed at a considerable distance you lose\r\nfirst the distinctness of the smallest parts; while the larger parts\r\nare left to the last, losing all distinctness of detail and outline;\r\nand what remains is an oval or spherical figure with confused edges. 570. OF PAINTING.

If you want to acquire facility for bearing in mind the expression\r\nof a face, first make yourself familiar with a variety of [forms of]\r\nseveral heads, eyes, noses, mouths, chins and cheeks and necks and\r\nshoulders: And to put a case: Noses are of 10 types: straight,\r\nbulbous, hollow, prominent above or below the middle, aquiline,\r\nregular, flat, round or pointed. These hold good as to profile. In\r\nfull face they are of 11 types; these are equal thick in the middle,\r\nthin in the middle, with the tip thick and the root narrow, or\r\nnarrow at the tip and wide at the root; with the nostrils wide or\r\nnarrow, high or low, and the openings wide or hidden by the point;\r\nand you will find an equal variety in the other details; which\r\nthings you must draw from nature and fix them in your mind. Or else,\r\nwhen you have to draw a face by heart, carry with you a little book\r\nin which you have noted such features; and when you have cast a\r\nglance at the face of the person you wish to draw, you can look, in\r\nprivate, which nose or mouth is most like, or there make a little\r\nmark to recognise it again at home. Of grotesque faces I need say\r\nnothing, because they are kept in mind without difficulty. The position of the head. 573. HOW YOU SHOULD SET TO WORK TO DRAW A HEAD OF WHICH ALL THE PARTS\r\nSHALL AGREE WITH THE POSITION GIVEN TO IT. To draw a head in which the features shall agree with the turn and\r\nbend of the head, pursue this method. You know that the eyes,\r\neyebrows, nostrils, corners of the mouth, and sides of the chin, the\r\njaws, cheeks, ears and all the parts of a face are squarely and\r\nstraightly set upon the face. [Footnote: Compare the drawings and the text belonging to them on\r\nPl. IX. (No. 315), Pl. X (No. 316), Pl. XL (No. 318) and Pl. XII. (No. 319).]\r\n\r\nTherefore when you have sketched the face draw lines passing from\r\none corner of the eye to the other; and so for the placing of each\r\nfeature; and after having drawn the ends of the lines beyond the two\r\nsides of the face, look if the spaces inside the same parallel lines\r\non the right and on the left are equal [12]. But be sure to remember\r\nto make these lines tend to the point of sight. [Footnote: See Pl. XXXI, No. 4, the slight sketch on the left hand\r\nside. The text of this passage is written by the side of it. In this\r\nsketch the lines seem intentionally incorrect and converging to the\r\nright (compare I. 12) instead of parallel.

Since it is proved that every definite light is, or seems to be,\r\nderived from one single point the side illuminated by it will have\r\nits highest light on the portion where the line of radiance falls\r\nperpendicularly; as is shown above in the lines _a g_, and also in\r\n_a h_ and in _l a_; and that portion of the illuminated side will be\r\nleast luminous, where the line of incidence strikes it between two\r\nmore dissimilar angles, as is seen at _b c d_. And by this means you\r\nmay also know which parts are deprived of light as is seen at _m k_. Where the angles made by the lines of incidence are most equal there\r\nwill be the highest light, and where they are most unequal it will\r\nbe darkest. I will make further mention of the reason of reflections. [Footnote: See Pl. XXXII. The text, here given complete, is on the\r\nright hand side. The small circles above the beginning of lines 5\r\nand 11 as well as the circle above the text on Pl.

When you compose a historical picture take two points, one the point\r\nof sight, and the other the source of light; and make this as\r\ndistant as possible. 578. Historical pictures ought not to be crowded and confused with too\r\nmany figures. 579. PRECEPTS IN PAINTING. Let you sketches of historical pictures be swift and the working out\r\nof the limbs not be carried too far, but limited to the position of\r\nthe limbs, which you can afterwards finish as you please and at your\r\nleisure. [Footnote: See Pl. XXXVIII, No. 2. The pen and ink drawing given\r\nthere as No. 3 may also be compared with this passage. It is in the\r\nWindsor collection where it is numbered 101.]\r\n\r\n580. The sorest misfortune is when your views are in advance of your\r\nwork. 581. Of composing historical pictures. Of not considering the limbs in\r\nthe figures in historical pictures; as many do who, in the wish to\r\nrepresent the whole of a figure, spoil their compositions. And when\r\nyou place one figure behind another take care to draw the whole of\r\nit so that the limbs which come in front of the nearer figures may\r\nstand out in their natural size and place. How to represent the differences of age and sex (582-583). 582. How the ages of man should be depicted: that is, Infancy, Childhood,\r\nYouth, Manhood, Old age, Decrepitude. [Footnote: No answer is here given to this question, in the original\r\nMS.]\r\n\r\n583. Old men ought to be represented with slow and heavy movements, their\r\nlegs bent at the knees, when they stand still, and their feet placed\r\nparallel and apart; bending low with the head leaning forward, and\r\ntheir arms but little extended. Women must be represented in modest attitudes, their legs close\r\ntogether, their arms closely folded, their heads inclined and\r\nsomewhat on one side.

Hence if\r\nyou wish to make an animal, imagined by you, appear natural--let us\r\nsay a Dragon, take for its head that of a mastiff or hound, with the\r\neyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the nose of a greyhound, the\r\nbrow of a lion, the temples of an old cock, the neck of a water\r\ntortoise.

OF THE DELUSIONS WHICH ARISE IN JUDGING OF THE LIMBS. A painter who has clumsy hands will paint similar hands in his\r\nworks, and the same will occur with any limb, unless long study has\r\ntaught him to avoid it. Therefore, O Painter, look carefully what\r\npart is most ill-favoured in your own person and take particular\r\npains to correct it in your studies. For if you are coarse, your\r\nfigures will seem the same and devoid of charm; and it is the same\r\nwith any part that may be good or poor in yourself; it will be shown\r\nin some degree in your figures. 587.

For it would seem that such resemblances often please us;\r\nand if you should be ugly, you would select faces that were not\r\nbeautiful and you would then make ugly faces, as many painters do.

And if\r\nyou wish to produce a figure that shall of itself look light and\r\ngraceful you must make the limbs elegant and extended, and without\r\ntoo much display of the muscles; and those few that are needed for\r\nyour purpose you must indicate softly, that is, not very prominent\r\nand without strong shadows; the limbs, and particularly the arms\r\neasy; that is, none of the limbs should be in a straight line with\r\nthe adjoining parts. And if the hips, which are the pole of a man,\r\nare by reason of his position, placed so, that the right is higher\r\nthan the left, make the point of the higher shoulder in a\r\nperpendicular line above the highest prominence of the hip, and let\r\nthis right shoulder be lower than the left. Let the pit of the\r\nthroat always be over the centre of the joint of the foot on which\r\nthe man is leaning. The leg which is free should have the knee lower\r\nthan the other, and near the other leg. The positions of the head\r\nand arms are endless and I shall therefore not enlarge on any rules\r\nfor them. Still, let them be easy and pleasing, with various turns\r\nand twists, and the joints gracefully bent, that they may not look\r\nlike pieces of wood. Of appropriate gestures (593-600). 593. A picture or representation of human figures, ought to be done in\r\nsuch a way as that the spectator may easily recognise, by means of\r\ntheir attitudes, the purpose in their minds. Thus, if you have to\r\nrepresent a man of noble character in the act of speaking, let his\r\ngestures be such as naturally accompany good words; and, in the same\r\nway, if you wish to depict a man of a brutal nature, give him fierce\r\nmovements; as with his arms flung out towards the listener, and his\r\nhead and breast thrust forward beyond his feet, as if following the\r\nspeaker's hands. Thus it is with a deaf and dumb person who, when he\r\nsees two men in conversation--although he is deprived of\r\nhearing--can nevertheless understand, from the attitudes and\r\ngestures of the speakers, the nature of their discussion. I once saw\r\nin Florence a man who had become deaf who, when you spoke very loud\r\ndid not understand you, but if you spoke gently and without making\r\nany sound, understood merely from the movement of the lips. Now\r\nperhaps you will say that the lips of a man who speaks loudly do not\r\nmove like those of one speaking softly, and that if they were to\r\nmove them alike they would be alike understood.

When you wish to represent a man speaking to a number of people,\r\nconsider the matter of which he has to treat and adapt his action to\r\nthe subject. Thus, if he speaks persuasively, let his action be\r\nappropriate to it. If the matter in hand be to set forth an\r\nargument, let the speaker, with the fingers of the right hand hold\r\none finger of the left hand, having the two smaller ones closed; and\r\nhis face alert, and turned towards the people with mouth a little\r\nopen, to look as though he spoke; and if he is sitting let him\r\nappear as though about to rise, with his head forward. If you\r\nrepresent him standing make him leaning slightly forward with body\r\nand head towards the people. These you must represent as silent and\r\nattentive, all looking at the orator's face with gestures of\r\nadmiration; and make some old men in astonishment at the things they\r\nhear, with the corners of their mouths pulled down and drawn in,\r\ntheir cheeks full of furrows, and their eyebrows raised, and\r\nwrinkling the forehead where they meet. Again, some sitting with\r\ntheir fingers clasped holding their weary knees. Again, some bent\r\nold man, with one knee crossed over the other; on which let him hold\r\nhis hand with his other elbow resting in it and the hand supporting\r\nhis bearded chin. [Footnote: The sketches introduced here are a facsimile of a pen and\r\nink drawing in the Louvre which Herr CARL BRUN considers as studies\r\nfor the Last Supper in the church of _Santa Maria delle Grazie_ (see\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, LXI, pp. 21, 27 and 28 in DOHME'S _Kunst und\r\nKunstler_, Leipzig, Seemann). I shall not here enter into any\r\ndiscussion of this suggestion; but as a justification for\r\nintroducing the drawing in this place, I may point out that some of\r\nthe figures illustrate this passage as perfectly as though they had\r\nbeen drawn for that express purpose. I have discussed the\r\nprobability of a connection between this sketch and the picture of\r\nthe Last Supper on p. 335. The original drawing is 27 3/4\r\ncentimetres wide by 21 high.--The drawing in silver point on reddish\r\npaper given on Pl. LII. No. 1--the original at Windsor Castle--may\r\nalso serve to illustrate the subject of appropriate gestures,\r\ntreated in Nos. 593 and 594.]\r\n\r\n595. OF THE DISPOSITION OF LIMBS. As regards the disposition of limbs in movement you will have to\r\nconsider that when you wish to represent a man who, by some chance,\r\nhas to turn backwards or to one side, you must not make him move his\r\nfeet and all his limbs towards the side to which he turns his head. Rather must you make the action proceed by degrees and through the\r\ndifferent joints; that is, those of the foot, the knee and the hip\r\nand the neck. And if you set him on the right leg, you must make the\r\nleft knee bend inwards, and let his foot be slightly raised on the\r\noutside, and the left shoulder be somewhat lower than the right,\r\nwhile the nape of the neck is in a line directly over the outer\r\nancle of the left foot. And the left shoulder will be in a\r\nperpendicular line above the toes of the right foot.

Of painting battle pieces (601-603). 601. OF THE WAY OF REPRESENTING A BATTLE. First you must represent the smoke of artillery mingling in the air\r\nwith the dust and tossed up by the movement of horses and the\r\ncombatants. And this mixture you must express thus: The dust, being\r\na thing of earth, has weight; and although from its fineness it is\r\neasily tossed up and mingles with the air, it nevertheless readily\r\nfalls again. It is the finest part that rises highest; hence that\r\npart will be least seen and will look almost of the same colour as\r\nthe air. The higher the smoke mixed with the dust-laden air rises\r\ntowards a certain level, the more it will look like a dark cloud;\r\nand it will be seen that at the top, where the smoke is more\r\nseparate from the dust, the smoke will assume a bluish tinge and the\r\ndust will tend to its colour. This mixture of air, smoke and dust\r\nwill look much lighter on the side whence the light comes than on\r\nthe opposite side. The more the combatants are in this turmoil the\r\nless will they be seen, and the less contrast will there be in their\r\nlights and shadows. Their faces and figures and their appearance,\r\nand the musketeers as well as those near them you must make of a\r\nglowing red. And this glow will diminish in proportion as it is\r\nremote from its cause. The figures which are between you and the light, if they be at a\r\ndistance, will appear dark on a light background, and the lower part\r\nof their legs near the ground will be least visible, because there\r\nthe dust is coarsest and densest [19].", "sentences": ["When you draw the nude always sketch the whole figure and then\r\nfinish those limbs which seem to you the best, but make them act\r\nwith the other limbs; otherwise you will get a habit of never\r\nputting the limbs well together on the body.", "Never make the head turn the same way as the torso, nor the arm and\r\nleg move together on the same side.", "And if the face is turned to the\r\nright shoulder, make all the parts lower on the left side than on\r\nthe right; and when you turn the body with the breast outwards, if\r\nthe head turns to the left side make the parts on the right side\r\nhigher than those on the left.", "[Footnote: In the original MS.", "a much defaced sketch is to be seen\r\nby the side of the second part of this chapter; its faded condition\r\nhas rendered reproduction impossible.", "In M.", "RAVAISSON'S facsimile\r\nthe outlines of the head have probably been touched up.", "This passage\r\nhowever is fitly illustrated by the drawings on Pl.", "XXI.]\r\n\r\n597.", "OF PAINTING.", "Of the nature of movements in man.", "Do not repeat the same gestures\r\nin the limbs of men unless you are compelled by the necessity of\r\ntheir action, as is shown in _a b_.", "[Footnote: See Pl.", "V, where part of the text is also reproduced.", "The\r\neffaced figure to the extreme left has evidently been cancelled by\r\nLeonardo himself as unsatisfactory.]\r\n\r\n598.", "The motions of men must be such as suggest their dignity or their\r\nbaseness.", "599.", "OF PAINTING.", "Make your work carry out your purpose and meaning.", "That is when you\r\ndraw a figure consider well who it is and what you wish it to be\r\ndoing.", "OF PAINTING.", "With regard to any action which you give in a picture to an old man\r\nor to a young one, you must make it more energetic in the young man\r\nin proportion as he is stronger than the old one; and in the same\r\nway with a young man and an infant.", "600.", "OF SETTING ON THE LIMBS.", "The limbs which are used for labour must be muscular and those which\r\nare not much used you must make without muscles and softly rounded.", "OF THE ACTION OF THE FIGURES.", "Represent your figures in such action as may be fitted to express\r\nwhat purpose is in the mind of each; otherwise your art will not be\r\nadmirable.", "V.", "SUGGESTIONS FOR COMPOSITIONS.", "Of painting battle pieces (601-603).", "601.", "OF THE WAY OF REPRESENTING A BATTLE.", "First you must represent the smoke of artillery mingling in the air\r\nwith the dust and tossed up by the movement of horses and the\r\ncombatants.", "And this mixture you must express thus: The dust, being\r\na thing of earth, has weight; and although from its fineness it is\r\neasily tossed up and mingles with the air, it nevertheless readily\r\nfalls again.", "It is the finest part that rises highest; hence that\r\npart will be least seen and will look almost of the same colour as\r\nthe air.", "The higher the smoke mixed with the dust-laden air rises\r\ntowards a certain level, the more it will look like a dark cloud;\r\nand it will be seen that at the top, where the smoke is more\r\nseparate from the dust, the smoke will assume a bluish tinge and the\r\ndust will tend to its colour.", "This mixture of air, smoke and dust\r\nwill look much lighter on the side whence the light comes than on\r\nthe opposite side.", "The more the combatants are in this turmoil the\r\nless will they be seen, and the less contrast will there be in their\r\nlights and shadows.", "Their faces and figures and their appearance,\r\nand the musketeers as well as those near them you must make of a\r\nglowing red.", "And this glow will diminish in proportion as it is\r\nremote from its cause.", "The figures which are between you and the light, if they be at a\r\ndistance, will appear dark on a light background, and the lower part\r\nof their legs near the ground will be least visible, because there\r\nthe dust is coarsest and densest [19]."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_126", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 126)", "language": "it", "content": "And if you introduce horses\r\ngalloping outside the crowd, make the little clouds of dust distant\r\nfrom each other in proportion to the strides made by the horses; and\r\nthe clouds which are furthest removed from the horses, should be\r\nleast visible; make them high and spreading and thin, and the nearer\r\nones will be more conspicuous and smaller and denser [23].

The figures which are seen against the fire look dark in the glare\r\nof the firelight because that side of the objects which you see is\r\ntinged by the darkness of the night and not by the fire; and those\r\nwho stand at the side are half dark and half red; while those who\r\nare visible beyond the edges of the flame will be fully lighted by\r\nthe ruddy glow against a black background. As to their gestures,\r\nmake those which are near it screen themselves with their hands and\r\ncloaks as a defence against the intense heat, and with their faces\r\nturned away as if about to retire.

Describe a storm of rain. 606. HOW TO REPRESENT A TEMPEST. If you wish to represent a tempest consider and arrange well its\r\neffects as seen, when the wind, blowing over the face of the sea and\r\nearth, removes and carries with it such things as are not fixed to\r\nthe general mass. And to represent the storm accurately you must\r\nfirst show the clouds scattered and torn, and flying with the wind,\r\naccompanied by clouds of sand blown up from the sea shore, and\r\nboughs and leaves swept along by the strength and fury of the blast\r\nand scattered with other light objects through the air. Trees and\r\nplants must be bent to the ground, almost as if they would follow\r\nthe course of the gale, with their branches twisted out of their\r\nnatural growth and their leaves tossed and turned about [Footnote\r\n11: See Pl. XL, No. 2.]. Of the men who are there some must have\r\nfallen to the ground and be entangled in their garments, and hardly\r\nto be recognized for the dust, while those who remain standing may\r\nbe behind some tree, with their arms round it that the wind may not\r\ntear them away; others with their hands over their eyes for the\r\ndust, bending to the ground with their clothes and hair streaming in\r\nthe wind. [Footnote 15: See Pl. XXXIV, the right hand lower sketch.]\r\nLet the sea be rough and tempestuous and full of foam whirled among\r\nthe lofty waves, while the wind flings the lighter spray through the\r\nstormy air, till it resembles a dense and swathing mist. Of the\r\nships that are therein some should be shown with rent sails and the\r\ntatters fluttering through the air, with ropes broken and masts\r\nsplit and fallen.

Of the objects\r\ncarried down by the current, those which are heaviest or rather\r\nlargest in mass will keep farthest from the two opposite shores. The\r\nwater in the eddies revolves more swiftly in proportion as it is\r\nnearer to their centre. The crests of the waves of the sea tumble to\r\ntheir bases falling with friction on the bubbles of their sides; and\r\nthis friction grinds the falling water into minute particles and\r\nthis being converted into a dense mist, mingles with the gale in the\r\nmanner of curling smoke and wreathing clouds, and at last it, rises\r\ninto the air and is converted into clouds. But the rain which falls\r\nthrough the atmosphere being driven and tossed by the winds becomes\r\nrarer or denser according to the rarity or density of the winds that\r\nbuffet it, and thus there is generated in the atmosphere a moisture\r\nformed of the transparent particles of the rain which is near to the\r\neye of the spectator. The waves of the sea which break on the slope\r\nof the mountains which bound it, will foam from the velocity with\r\nwhich they fall against these hills; in rushing back they will meet\r\nthe next wave as it comes and and after a loud noise return in a\r\ngreat flood to the sea whence they came. Let great numbers of\r\ninhabitants--men and animals of all kinds--be seen driven [54] by\r\nthe rising of the deluge to the peaks of the mountains in the midst\r\nof the waters aforesaid. The wave of the sea at Piombino is all foaming water. [Footnote 55. 56: These two lines are written below the bottom sketch on Pl. XXXV,\r\n3. The MS.

[17] A mountain falling on a town, will fling up dust in the form of\r\nclouds; but the colour of this dust will differ from that of the\r\nclouds. Where the rain is thickest let the colour of the dust be\r\nless conspicuous and where the dust is thickest let the rain be less\r\nconspicuous.

Make some oil of mustard seed; and if you wish to make it with\r\ngreater ease mix the ground seeds with linseed oil and put it all\r\nunder the press. 630. TO REMOVE THE SMELL OF OIL. Take the rank oil and put ten pints into a jar and make a mark on\r\nthe jar at the height of the oil; then add to it a pint of vinegar\r\nand make it boil till the oil has sunk to the level of the mark and\r\nthus you will be certain that the oil is returned to its original\r\nquantity and the vinegar will have gone off in vapour, carrying with\r\nit the evil smell; and I believe you may do the same with nut oil or\r\nany other oil that smells badly. 631. Since walnuts are enveloped in a thin rind, which partakes of the\r\nnature of ..., if you do not remove it when you make the oil from\r\nthem, this skin tinges the oil, and when you work with it this skin\r\nseparates from the oil and rises to the surface of the painting, and\r\nthis is what makes it change. 632. TO RESTORE OIL COLOURS THAT HAVE BECOME DRY. If you want to restore oil colours that have become dry keep them\r\nsoaking in soft soap for a night and, with your finger, mix them up\r\nwith the soft soap; then pour them into a cup and wash them with\r\nwater, and in this way you can restore colours that have got dry. But take care that each colour has its own vessel to itself adding\r\nthe colour by degrees as you restore it and mind that they are\r\nthoroughly softened, and when you wish to use them for tempera wash\r\nthem five and six times with spring water, and leave them to settle;\r\nif the soft soap should be thick with any of the colours pass it\r\nthrough a filter. [Footnote: The same remark applies to these\r\nsections as to No. 618 and 619.]\r\n\r\n633. OIL. Mustard seed pounded with linseed oil. 634. ... outside the bowl 2 fingers lower than the level of the oil, and\r\npass it into the neck of a bottle and let it stand and thus all the\r\noil will separate from this milky liquid; it will enter the bottle\r\nand be as clear as crystal; and grind your colours with this, and\r\nevery coarse or viscid part will remain in the liquid.

PHILOSOPHY AND HISTORY OF THE ART OF PAINTING. The relation of art and nature (651. 652). 651. What is fair in men, passes away, but not so in art. 652. HE WHO DESPISES PAINTING LOVES NEITHER PHILOSOPHY NOR NATURE. If you condemn painting, which is the only imitator of all visible\r\nworks of nature, you will certainly despise a subtle invention which\r\nbrings philosophy and subtle speculation to the consideration of the\r\nnature of all forms--seas and plains, trees, animals, plants and\r\nflowers--which are surrounded by shade and light. And this is true\r\nknowledge and the legitimate issue of nature; for painting is born\r\nof nature--or, to speak more correctly, we will say it is the\r\ngrandchild of nature; for all visible things are produced by nature,\r\nand these her children have given birth to painting. Hence we may\r\njustly call it the grandchild of nature and related to God. Painting is superior to poetry (653. 654). 653. THAT PAINTING SURPASSES ALL HUMAN WORKS BY THE SUBTLE CONSIDERATIONS\r\nBELONGING TO IT. The eye, which is called the window of the soul, is the principal\r\nmeans by which the central sense can most completely and abundantly\r\nappreciate the infinite works of nature; and the ear is the second,\r\nwhich acquires dignity by hearing of the things the eye has seen. If\r\nyou, historians, or poets, or mathematicians had not seen things\r\nwith your eyes you could not report of them in writing. And if you,\r\n0 poet, tell a story with your pen, the painter with his brush can\r\ntell it more easily, with simpler completeness and less tedious to\r\nbe understood. And if you call painting dumb poetry, the painter may\r\ncall poetry blind painting. Now which is the worse defect? to be\r\nblind or dumb? Though the poet is as free as the painter in the\r\ninvention of his fictions they are not so satisfactory to men as\r\npaintings; for, though poetry is able to describe forms, actions and\r\nplaces in words, the painter deals with the actual similitude of the\r\nforms, in order to represent them. Now tell me which is the nearer\r\nto the actual man: the name of man or the image of the man. The name\r\nof man differs in different countries, but his form is never changed\r\nbut by death. 654.", "sentences": ["Powder gall nuts and let this stand 8 days in the white wine; and in\r\nthe same way dissolve vitriol in water, and let the water stand and\r\nsettle very clear, and the wine likewise, each by itself, and strain\r\nthem well; and when you dilute the white wine with the water the\r\nwine will become red.", "647.", "Put marcasite into aqua fortis and if it turns green, know that it\r\nhas copper in it.", "Take it out with saltpetre and soft soap.", "648.", "A white horse may have the spots removed with the Spanish haematite\r\nor with aqua fortis or with ...", "Removes the black hair on a white\r\nhorse with the singeing iron.", "Force him to the ground.", "649.", "FIRE.", "If you want to make a fire which will set a hall in a blaze without\r\ninjury do this: first perfume the hall with a dense smoke of incense\r\nor some other odoriferous substance: It is a good trick to play.", "Or\r\nboil ten pounds of brandy to evaporate, but see that the hall is\r\ncompletely closed and throw up some powdered varnish among the fumes\r\nand this powder will be supported by the smoke; then go into the\r\nroom suddenly with a lighted torch and at once it will be in a\r\nblaze.", "650.", "FIRE.", "Take away that yellow surface which covers oranges and distill them\r\nin an alembic, until the distillation may be said to be perfect.", "FIRE.", "Close a room tightly and have a brasier of brass or iron with fire\r\nin it and sprinkle on it two pints of aqua vitae, a little at a\r\ntime, so that it may be converted into smoke.", "Then make some one\r\ncome in with a light and suddenly you will see the room in a blaze\r\nlike a flash of lightning, and it will do no harm to any one.", "VII.", "PHILOSOPHY AND HISTORY OF THE ART OF PAINTING.", "The relation of art and nature (651.", "652).", "651.", "What is fair in men, passes away, but not so in art.", "652.", "HE WHO DESPISES PAINTING LOVES NEITHER PHILOSOPHY NOR NATURE.", "If you condemn painting, which is the only imitator of all visible\r\nworks of nature, you will certainly despise a subtle invention which\r\nbrings philosophy and subtle speculation to the consideration of the\r\nnature of all forms--seas and plains, trees, animals, plants and\r\nflowers--which are surrounded by shade and light.", "And this is true\r\nknowledge and the legitimate issue of nature; for painting is born\r\nof nature--or, to speak more correctly, we will say it is the\r\ngrandchild of nature; for all visible things are produced by nature,\r\nand these her children have given birth to painting.", "Hence we may\r\njustly call it the grandchild of nature and related to God.", "Painting is superior to poetry (653.", "654).", "653.", "THAT PAINTING SURPASSES ALL HUMAN WORKS BY THE SUBTLE CONSIDERATIONS\r\nBELONGING TO IT.", "The eye, which is called the window of the soul, is the principal\r\nmeans by which the central sense can most completely and abundantly\r\nappreciate the infinite works of nature; and the ear is the second,\r\nwhich acquires dignity by hearing of the things the eye has seen.", "If\r\nyou, historians, or poets, or mathematicians had not seen things\r\nwith your eyes you could not report of them in writing.", "And if you,\r\n0 poet, tell a story with your pen, the painter with his brush can\r\ntell it more easily, with simpler completeness and less tedious to\r\nbe understood.", "And if you call painting dumb poetry, the painter may\r\ncall poetry blind painting.", "Now which is the worse defect?", "to be\r\nblind or dumb?", "Though the poet is as free as the painter in the\r\ninvention of his fictions they are not so satisfactory to men as\r\npaintings; for, though poetry is able to describe forms, actions and\r\nplaces in words, the painter deals with the actual similitude of the\r\nforms, in order to represent them.", "Now tell me which is the nearer\r\nto the actual man: the name of man or the image of the man.", "The name\r\nof man differs in different countries, but his form is never changed\r\nbut by death.", "654."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_137", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 137)", "language": "it", "content": "And if the poet gratifies the sense by means of the ear, the painter\r\ndoes so by the eye--the worthier sense; but I will say no more of\r\nthis but that, if a good painter represents the fury of a battle,\r\nand if a poet describes one, and they are both together put before\r\nthe public, you will see where most of the spectators will stop, to\r\nwhich they will pay most attention, on which they will bestow most\r\npraise, and which will satisfy them best. Undoubtedly painting being\r\nby a long way the more intelligible and beautiful, will please most. Write up the name of God [Christ] in some spot and setup His image\r\nopposite and you will see which will be most reverenced. Painting\r\ncomprehends in itself all the forms of nature, while you have\r\nnothing but words, which are not universal as form is, and if you\r\nhave the effects of the representation, we have the representation\r\nof the effects. Take a poet who describes the beauty of a lady to\r\nher lover and a painter who represents her and you will see to which\r\nnature guides the enamoured critic. Certainly the proof should be\r\nallowed to rest on the verdict of experience. You have ranked\r\npainting among the mechanical arts but, in truth, if painters were\r\nas apt at praising their own works in writing as you are, it would\r\nnot lie under the stigma of so base a name. If you call it\r\nmechanical because it is, in the first place, manual, and that it is\r\nthe hand which produces what is to be found in the imagination, you\r\ntoo writers, who set down manually with the pen what is devised in\r\nyour mind. And if you say it is mechanical because it is done for\r\nmoney, who falls into this error--if error it can be called--more\r\nthan you? If you lecture in the schools do you not go to whoever\r\npays you most? Do you do any work without pay? Still, I do not say\r\nthis as blaming such views, for every form of labour looks for its\r\nreward. And if a poet should say: \"I will invent a fiction with a\r\ngreat purpose,\" the painter can do the same, as Apelles painted\r\nCalumny. If you were to say that poetry is more eternal, I say the\r\nworks of a coppersmith are more eternal still, for time preserves\r\nthem longer than your works or ours; nevertheless they have not much\r\nimagination [29]. And a picture, if painted on copper with enamel\r\ncolours may be yet more permanent. We, by our arts may be called the\r\ngrandsons of God. If poetry deals with moral philosophy, painting\r\ndeals with natural philosophy. Poetry describes the action of the\r\nmind, painting considers what the mind may effect by the motions [of\r\nthe body]. If poetry can terrify people by hideous fictions,\r\npainting can do as much by depicting the same things in action. Supposing that a poet applies himself to represent beauty, ferocity,\r\nor a base, a foul or a monstrous thing, as against a painter, he may\r\nin his ways bring forth a variety of forms; but will the painter not\r\nsatisfy more? are there not pictures to be seen, so like the actual\r\nthings, that they deceive men and animals? Painting is superior to sculpture (655. 656). 655. THAT SCULPTURE IS LESS INTELLECTUAL THAN PAINTING, AND LACKS MANY\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF NATURE. I myself, having exercised myself no less in sculpture than in\r\npainting and doing both one and the other in the same degree, it\r\nseems to me that I can, without invidiousness, pronounce an opinion\r\nas to which of the two is of the greatest merit and difficulty and\r\nperfection.

J. LERMOLIEFF has already pointed out that in\r\nthe various collections containing pictures by the great masters of\r\nthe Italian Renaissance, those painted on copper (for instance the\r\nfamous reading Magdalen in the Dresden Gallery) are the works of a\r\nmuch later date (see _Zeitschrift fur bildende Kunst_. Vol. X pg. 333, and: _Werke italienischer Master in den Galerien von Munchen,\r\nDresden und Berlin_. Leipzig 1880, pg. 158 and 159.)--Compare No. 654, 29.], a picture painted on thick copper covered with white\r\nenamel on which it is painted with enamel colours and then put into\r\nthe fire again and baked, far exceeds sculpture in permanence. It\r\nmay be said that if a mistake is made it is not easy to remedy it;\r\nit is but a poor argument to try to prove that a work be the nobler\r\nbecause oversights are irremediable; I should rather say that it\r\nwill be more difficult to improve the mind of the master who makes\r\nsuch mistakes than to repair the work he has spoilt. 656. We know very well that a really experienced and good painter will\r\nnot make such mistakes; on the contrary, with sound rules he will\r\nremove so little at a time that he will bring his work to a good\r\nissue. Again the sculptor if working in clay or wax, can add or\r\nreduce, and when his model is finished it can easily be cast in\r\nbronze, and this is the last operation and is the most permanent\r\nform of sculpture. Inasmuch as that which is merely of marble is\r\nliable to ruin, but not bronze. Hence a painting done on copper\r\nwhich as I said of painting may be added to or altered, resembles\r\nsculpture in bronze, which, having first been made in wax could then\r\nbe altered or added to; and if sculpture in bronze is durable, this\r\nwork in copper and enamel is absolutely imperishable. Bronze is but\r\ndark and rough after all, but this latter is covered with various\r\nand lovely colours in infinite variety, as has been said above; or\r\nif you will have me only speak of painting on panel, I am content to\r\npronounce between it and sculpture; saying that painting is the more\r\nbeautiful and the more imaginative and the more copious, while\r\nsculpture is the more durable but it has nothing else. Sculpture\r\nshows with little labour what in painting appears a miraculous thing\r\nto do; to make what is impalpable appear palpable, flat objects\r\nappear in relief, distant objects seem close.

Hence the painter will produce pictures of small merit if he takes\r\nfor his standard the pictures of others. But if he will study from\r\nnatural objects he will bear good fruit; as was seen in the painters\r\nafter the Romans who always imitated each other and so their art\r\nconstantly declined from age to age. After these came Giotto the\r\nFlorentine who--not content with imitating the works of Cimabue his\r\nmaster--being born in the mountains and in a solitude inhabited only\r\nby goats and such beasts, and being guided by nature to his art,\r\nbegan by drawing on the rocks the movements of the goats of which he\r\nwas keeper. And thus he began to draw all the animals which were to\r\nbe found in the country, and in such wise that after much study he\r\nexcelled not only all the masters of his time but all those of many\r\nbygone ages. Afterwards this art declined again, because everyone\r\nimitated the pictures that were already done; thus it went on from\r\ncentury to century until Tomaso, of Florence, nicknamed Masaccio,\r\nshowed by his perfect works how those who take for their standard\r\nany one but nature--the mistress of all masters--weary themselves in\r\nvain. And, I would say about these mathematical studies that those\r\nwho only study the authorities and not the works of nature are\r\ndescendants but not sons of nature the mistress of all good authors. Oh! how great is the folly of those who blame those who learn from\r\nnature [Footnote 22: _lasciando stare li autori_. In this\r\nobservation we may detect an indirect evidence that Leonardo\r\nregarded his knowledge of natural history as derived from his own\r\ninvestigations, as well as his theories of perspective and optics.

They are studies for the head of St. Matthew, the fourth figure on Christ's left hand--see Pl. XL VII,\r\nthe sketch (in black chalk) for the head of St. Philip, the third\r\nfigure on the left hand--see Pl. XL VIII, for St. Peter's right\r\narm--see Pl. XLIX, and for the expressive head of Judas which has\r\nunfortunately somewhat suffered by subsequent restoration of\r\noutlines,--see Pl. L. According to a tradition, as unfounded as it\r\nis improbable, Leonardo made use of the head of Padre Bandelli, the\r\nprior of the convent, as the prototype of his Judas; this however\r\nhas already been contradicted by Amoretti \"Memorie storiche\" cap. XIV. The study of the head of a criminal on Pl. LI has, it seems to\r\nme, a better claim to be regarded as one of the preparatory sketches\r\nfor the head of Judas. The Windsor collection contains two old\r\ncopies of the head of St. Simon, the figure to the extreme left of\r\nChrist, both of about equal merit (they are marked as Nos._ 21 _and_\r\n36_)--the second was reproduced on Pl. VIII of the Grosvenor\r\nGallery Publication in_ 1878. _There is also at Windsor a drawing in\r\nblack chalk of folded hands (marked with the old No._ 212; _No. LXI\r\nof the Grosvenor Gallery Publication) which I believe to be a copy\r\nof the hands of St. John, by some unknown pupil. A reproduction of\r\nthe excellent drawings of heads of Apostles in the possession of H. R. H. the Grand Duchess of Weimar would have been out of my province\r\nin this work, and, with regard to them, I must confine myself to\r\npointing out that the difference in style does not allow of our\r\nplacing the Weimar drawings in the same category as those here\r\nreproduced. The mode of grouping in the Weimar drawings is of itself\r\nsufficient to indicate that they were not executed before the\r\npicture was painted, but, on the contrary, afterwards, and it is, on\r\nthe face of it, incredible that so great a master should thus have\r\ncopied from his own work. The drawing of Christ's head, in the Brera palace at Milan was\r\nperhaps originally the work of Leonardo's hand; it has unfortunately\r\nbeen entirely retouched and re-drawn, so that no decisive opinion\r\ncan be formed as to its genuineness. The red chalk drawing reproduced on Pl. XLVI is in the Accademia at\r\nVenice; it was probably made before the text, Nos._ 664 _and_ 665,\r\n_was written. The two pen and ink sketches on Pl. XLV seem to belong to an even\r\nearlier date; the more finished drawing of the two, on the right\r\nhand, represents Christ with only St. John and Judas and a third\r\ndisciple whose action is precisely that described in No._ 666,\r\n_Pl._ 4. _It is hardly necessary to observe that the other sketches\r\non this page and the lines of text below the circle (containing the\r\nsolution of a geometrical problem) have no reference to the picture\r\nof the Last Supper.

Both have been lost in some wholly inexplicable manner. I cannot here enter into the remarkable history of this work; I can\r\nonly give an account of what has been preserved to us of Leonardo's\r\nscheme and preparations for executing it. The extent of the material\r\nin studies and drawings was till now quite unknown. Their\r\npublication here may give some adequate idea of the grandeur of this\r\nfamous work. The text given as No._ 669 _contains a description of\r\nthe particulars of the battle, but for the reasons given in the note\r\nto this text, I must abandon the idea of taking this passage as the\r\nbasis of my attempt to reconstruct the picture as the artist\r\nconceived and executed it. I may here remind the reader that Leonardo prepared the cartoon in\r\nthe Sala del Papa of Santa Maria Novella at Florence and worked\r\nthere from the end of October 1503 till February 1504, and then was\r\nbusied with the painting in the Sala del Consiglio in the Palazzo\r\ndella Signoria, till the work was interrupted at the end of May\r\n1506. (See Milanesi's note to Vasari pp. 43--45 Vol. IV ed. 1880.)\r\nVasari, as is well known, describes only one scene or episode of the\r\ncartoon--the Battle for the Standard in the foreground of the\r\ncomposition, as it would seem; and this only was ever finished as a\r\nmural decoration in the Sala del Consiglio. This portion of the\r\ncomposition is familiar to all from the disfigured copy engraved by\r\nEdelinck. Mariette had already very acutely observed that Edelinck\r\nmust surely have worked from a Flemish copy of the picture. There is\r\nin the Louvre a drawing by Rubens (No. 565) which also represents\r\nfour horsemen fighting round a standard and which agrees with\r\nEdelinck's engraving, but the engraving reverses the drawing. An\r\nearlier Flemish drawing, such as may have served as the model for\r\nboth Rubens and Edelinck, is in the Uffizi collection (see\r\nPhilpots's Photograph, No. 732). It seems to be a work of the second\r\nhalf of the XVIth century, a time when both the picture and the\r\ncartoon had already been destroyed. It is apparently the production\r\nof a not very skilled hand. Raphael Trichet du Fresne, 1651,\r\nmentions that a small picture by Leonardo himself of the Battle of\r\nthe Standard was then extant in the Tuileries; by this he probably\r\nmeans the painting on panel which is now in the possession of Madame\r\nTimbal in Paris, and which has lately been engraved by Haussoullier\r\nas a work by Leonardo. The picture, which is very carefully painted,\r\nseems to me however to be the work of some unknown Florentine\r\npainter, and probably executed within the first ten years of the\r\nXVIth century. At the same time, it would seem to be a copy not from\r\nLeonardo's cartoon, but from his picture in the Palazzo della\r\nSignoria; at any rate this little picture, and the small Flemish\r\ndrawing in Florence are the oldest finished copies of this episode\r\nin the great composition of the Battle of Anghiari. In his Life of Raphael, Vasari tells us that Raphael copied certain\r\nworks of Leonardo's during his stay in Florence. Raphael's first\r\nvisit to Florence lasted from the middle of October 1504 till July\r\n1505, and he revisited it in the summer of 1506. The hasty sketch,\r\nnow in the possession of the University of Oxford and reproduced on\r\npage 337 also represents the Battle of the Standard and seems to\r\nhave been made during his first stay, and therefore not from the\r\nfresco but from the cartoon; for, on the same sheet we also find,\r\nbesides an old man's head drawn in Leonardo's style, some studies\r\nfor the figure of St. John the Martyr which Raphael used in 1505 in\r\nhis great fresco in the Church of San Severo at Perugia.", "sentences": ["notes ever allude to it,\r\nthough according to Vasari the master had it in hand for fully four\r\nyears.", "Leonardo's cartoon for the picture of the battle of Anghiari has\r\nshared the fate of the rival work, Michaelangelo's \"Bathers summoned\r\nto Battle\".", "Both have been lost in some wholly inexplicable manner.", "I cannot here enter into the remarkable history of this work;

LII 2, Pl. LIII, Pl. LVI--we find studies for the episode of the Standard. The standard\r\nbearer, who, in the above named copies is seen stooping, holding on\r\nto the staff across his shoulder, is immediately recognisable as the\r\nleft-hand figure in Raphael's sketch, and we find it in a similar\r\nattitude in Leonardo's pen and ink drawing in the British\r\nMuseum--Pl. LII, 2--the lower figure to the right. It is not\r\ndifficult to identify the same figure in two more complicated groups\r\nin the pen and ink drawings, now in the Accademia at Venice--Pl. LIII, and Pl. LIV--where we also find some studies of foot soldiers\r\nfighting. On the sheet in the British Museum--Pl. LII, 2--we find,\r\namong others, one group of three horses galloping forwards: one\r\nhorseman is thrown and protects himself with his buckler against the\r\nlance thrusts of two others on horseback, who try to pierce him as\r\nthey ride past. The same action is repeated, with some variation, in\r\ntwo sketches in pen and ink on a third sheet, in the Accademia at\r\nVenice, Pl. LV; a coincidence which suggests the probability of such\r\nan incident having actually been represented on the cartoon. We are\r\nnot, it is true, in a position to declare with any certainty which\r\nof these three dissimilar sketches may have been the nearest to the\r\ngroup finally adopted in executing the cartoon. With regard, however, to one of the groups of horsemen it is\r\npossible to determine with perfect certainty not only which\r\narrangement was preferred, but the position it occupied in the\r\ncomposition. The group of horsemen on Pl. LVII is a drawing in black\r\nchalk at Windsor, which is there attributed to Leonardo, but which\r\nappears to me to be the work of Cesare da Sesto, and the\r\nCommendatore Giov. Morelli supports me in this view. It can hardly\r\nbe doubted that da Sesto, as a pupil of Leonardo's, made this\r\ndrawing from his master's cartoon, if we compare it with the copy\r\nmade by Raphael--here reproduced, for just above the fighting\r\nhorseman in Raphael's copy it is possible to detect a horse which is\r\nseen from behind, going at a slower pace, with his tail flying out\r\nto the right and the same horse may be seen in the very same\r\nattitude carrying a dimly sketched rider, in the foreground of\r\nCesare da Sesto's drawing._\r\n\r\n_If a very much rubbed drawing in black chalk at Windsor--Pl. LVI--is, as it appears to be, the reversed impression of an original\r\ndrawing, it is not difficult to supplement from it the portions\r\ndrawn by Cesare da Sesto. Nay, it may prove possible to reconstruct\r\nthe whole of the lost cartoon from the mass of materials we now have\r\nat hand which we may regard as the nucleus of the composition. A\r\nlarge pen and ink drawing by Raphael in the Dresden collection,\r\nrepresenting three horsemen fighting, and another, by Cesare da\r\nSesto, in the Uffizi, of light horsemen fighting are a further\r\ncontribution which will help us to reconstruct it._\r\n\r\n_The sketch reproduced on Pl. LV gives a suggestive example of the\r\nway in which foot-soldiers may have been introduced into the cartoon\r\nas fighting among the groups of horsemen; and I may here take the\r\nopportunity of mentioning that, for reasons which it would be out of\r\nplace to enlarge upon here, I believe the two genuine drawings by\r\nRaphael's hand in his \"Venetian sketch-book\" as it is called--one of\r\na standard bearer marching towards the left, and one of two\r\nfoot-soldiers armed with spears and fighting with a horseman--to be\r\nundoubtedly copies from the cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari._\r\n\r\n_Leonardo's two drawings, preserved in the museum at Buda-Pesth and\r\nreproduced on pages 338 and 339 are preliminary studies for the\r\nheads of fighting warriors.

An old copy of\r\nthe last named drawing by a pupil of Leonardo is in MS. C. A. 187b;\r\n561b (See Saggio, Tav. XXII). Leonardo used to make such finished\r\nstudies of heads as those, drawn on detached sheets, before\r\nbeginning his pictures from his drawings--compare the preparatory\r\nstudies for the fresco of the Last Supper, given on Pl. XLVII and\r\nPl. L. Other drawings of heads, all characterised by the expression\r\nof vehement excitement that is appropriate to men fighting, are to\r\nbe seen at Windsor (No. 44) and at the Accademia at Venice (IV, 13);\r\nat the back of one of the drawings at Buda-Pesth there is the bust\r\nof a warrior carrying a spear on his left shoulder, holding up the\r\nleft arm (See Csatakepek a XVI--lk Szazadbol osszeallitotta Pvlszky\r\nKaroly). These drawings may have been made for other portions of the\r\ncartoon, of which no copies exist, and thus we are unable to\r\nidentify these preparatory drawings. Finally I may add that a sketch\r\nof fighting horse and foot soldiers, formerly in the possession of\r\nM. Thiers and published by Charles Blanc in his \"Vies des Peintres\"\r\ncan hardly be accepted as genuine. It is not to be found, as I am\r\ninformed, among the late President's property, and no one appears to\r\nknow where it now is._\r\n\r\n_An attempted reconstruction of the Cartoon, which is not only\r\nunsuccessful but perfectly unfounded, is to be seen in the\r\nlithograph by Bergeret, published in Charles Blanc's \"Vies des\r\npeintres\" and reprinted in \"The great Artists. L. da Vinci\", p. 80. This misleading pasticcio may now be rejected without hesitation._\r\n\r\n_There are yet a few original drawings by Leonardo which might be\r\nmentioned here as possibly belonging to the cartoon of the Battle;\r\nsuch as the pen and ink sketches on Pl. XXI and on Pl. XXXVIII, No. 3, but we should risk too wide a departure from the domain of\r\nascertained fact._\r\n\r\n_With regard to the colours and other materials used by Leonardo the\r\nreader may be referred to the quotations from the accounts for the\r\npicture in question given by Milanesi in his edition of Vasari (Vol. IV, p. 44, note) where we find entries of a similar character to\r\nthose in Leonardo's note books for the year 1505; S. K. M. 12 (see\r\nNo. 636)._\r\n\r\n_That Leonardo was employed in designing decorations and other\r\npreparations for high festivals, particularly for the court of\r\nMilan, we learn not only from the writings of his contemporaries but\r\nfrom his own incidental allusions; for instance in MS. C. l5b (1),\r\nl. 9. In the arrangement of the texts referring to this I have\r\nplaced those first, in which historical personages are named--Nos. 670-674. Among the descriptions of Allegorical subjects two texts\r\nlately found at Oxford have been included, Nos. 676 and 677. They\r\nare particularly interesting because they are accompanied by large\r\nsketches which render the meaning of the texts perfectly clear. It\r\nis very intelligible that in other cases, where there are no\r\nillustrative sketches, the notes must necessarily remain obscure or\r\nadmit of various interpretations. The literature of the time affords\r\nample evidence of the use of such allegorical representations,\r\nparticularly during the Carnival and in Leonardo's notes we find the\r\nCarnival expressly mentioned--Nos. 685 and 704.

[In the autumn of] 1478 I began the two Madonna [pictures]. [Footnote: Photographs of this page have been published by BRAUN,\r\nNo. 439, and PHILPOT, No. 718. 1. _Incominciai_. We have no other information as to the two\r\npictures of the Madonna here spoken of. As Leonardo here tells us\r\nthat he had begun two Madonnas at the same time, the word\r\n'_incominciai_' may be understood to mean that he had begun at the\r\nsame time preparatory studies for two pictures to be painted later. If this is so, the non-existence of the pictures may be explained by\r\nsupposing that they were only planned and never executed. I may here\r\nmention a few studies for pictures of the Madonna which probably\r\nbelong to this early time; particularly a drawing in silver-point on\r\nbluish tinted paper at Windsor--see Pl. XL, No. 3--, a drawing of\r\nwhich the details have almost disappeared in the original but have\r\nbeen rendered quite distinct in the reproduction; secondly a slight\r\npen and ink sketch in, the Codex VALLARDI, in the Louvre, fol. 64,\r\nNo. 2316; again a silver point drawing of a Virgin and child drawn\r\nover again with the pen in the His de la Salle collection also in\r\nthe Louvre, No. 101. (See Vicomte BOTH DE TAUZIA, _Notice des\r\ndessins de la collection His de la Salle, exposes au Louvre_. Paris\r\n1881, pp. 80, 81.) This drawing is, it is true, traditionally\r\nascribed to Raphael, but the author of the catalogue very justly\r\npoints out its great resemblance with the sketches for Madonnas in\r\nthe British Museum which are indisputably Leonardo's. Some of these\r\nhave been published by Mr. HENRY WALLIS in the Art Journal, New Ser. No. 14, Feb. 1882. If the non-existence of the two pictures here\r\nalluded to justifies my hypothesis that only studies for such\r\npictures are meant by the text, it may also be supposed that the\r\ndrawings were made for some comrade in VERROCCHIO'S atelier. (See\r\nVASARI, Sansoni's ed. Florence 1880. Vol. IV, p. 564): \"_E perche a\r\nLerenzo piaceva fuor di modo la maniera di Lionardo, la seppe cosi\r\nbene imitare, che niuno fu che nella pulitezza e nel finir l'opere\r\ncon diligenza l'imitasse più di lui_.\" Leonardo's notes give me no\r\nopportunity of discussing the pictures executed by him in Florence,\r\nbefore he moved to Milan. So the studies for the unfinished picture\r\nof the Adoration of the Magi--in the Uffizi, Florence--cannot be\r\ndescribed here, nor would any discussion about the picture in the\r\nLouvre \"_La Vierge aux Rochers_\" be appropriate in the absence of\r\nall allusion to it in the MSS. Therefore, when I presently add a few\r\nremarks on this painting in explanation of the Master's drawings for\r\nit, it will be not merely with a view to facilitate critical\r\nresearches about the picture now in the National Gallery, London,\r\nwhich by some critics has been pronounced to be a replica of the\r\nLouvre picture, but also because I take this opportunity of\r\npublishing several finished studies of the Master's which, even if\r\nthey were not made in Florence but later in Milan, must have been\r\nprior to the painting of the Last Supper. The original picture in\r\nParis is at present so disfigured by dust and varnish that the\r\ncurrent reproductions in photography actually give evidence more of\r\nthe injuries to which the picture has been exposed than of the\r\noriginal work itself.

Bernardo Bandini alone seemed to be\r\nfavoured by fortune; he hid first in the tower of the Cathedral, and\r\nthen escaped undiscovered from Florence. Poliziano, who was with\r\nLorenzo in the Cathedral, says in his 'Conjurationis Pactianae\r\nCommentarium': \"_Bandinus fugitans in Tiphernatem incidit, a quo in\r\naciem receptus Senas pervenit_.\" And Gino Capponi in summing up the\r\nreports of the numerous contemporary narrators of the event, says:\r\n\"_Bernardo Bandini ricoverato in Costantinopoli, fu per ordine del\r\nSultano preso e consegnato a un Antonio di Bernardino dei Medici,\r\nche Lorenzo aveva mandato apposta in Turchia: così era grande la\r\npotenza di quest' uomo e grande la voglia di farne mostra e che non\r\nrestasse in vita chi aveagli ucciso il fratello, fu egli applicato\r\nappena giunto_\" (_Storia della Republica di Firenze II_, 377, 378). Details about the dates may be found in the _Chronichetta di\r\nBelfredello Strinati Alfieri_: \"_Bernardo di Bandino Bandini\r\nsopradetto ne venne preso da Gostantinopoti a dì 14. Dicembre 1479 e\r\ndisaminato, che fu al Bargello, fu impiccato alle finestre di detto\r\nBargello allato alla Doana a dì 29. Dicembre MCCCCLXXIX che pochi dì\r\nstette_.\" It may however be mentioned with reference to the mode of\r\nwriting the name of the assassin that, though most of his\r\ncontemporaries wrote Bernardo Bandini, in the _Breve Chronicon\r\nCaroli Petri de Joanninis_ he is called Bernardo di Bandini\r\nBaroncelli; and, in the _Sententiae Domini Matthaei de Toscana_,\r\nBernardus Joannis Bandini de Baroncellis, as is written on\r\nLeonardo's drawing of him when hanged. Now VASARI, in the life of\r\n_Andrea del Castagno_ (Vol. II, 680; ed. Milanesi 1878), tells us\r\nthat in 1478 this painter was commissioned by order of the Signoria\r\nto represent the members of the Pazzi conspiracy as traitors, on the\r\nfacade of the Palazzo del Podestà--the Bargello. This statement is\r\nobviously founded on a mistake, for Andrea del Castagno was already\r\ndead in 1457. He had however been commissioned to paint Rinaldo\r\ndegli Albizzi, when declared a rebel and exiled in 1434, and his\r\nadherents, as hanging head downwards; and in consequence he had\r\nacquired the nickname of Andrea degl' Impiccati. On the 21st July\r\n1478 the Council of Eight came to the following resolution: \"_item\r\nservatis etc. deliberaverunt et santiaverunt Sandro Botticelli pro\r\nejus labore in pingendo proditores flor. quadraginta largos_\" (see\r\nG. MILANESI, _Arch. star. VI_ (1862) p. 5 note.)\r\n\r\nAs has been told, Giuliano de' Medici was murdered on the 26th April\r\n1478, and we see by this that only three months later Botticelli was\r\npaid for his painting of the \"_proditores_\". We can however hardly\r\nsuppose that all the members of the conspiracy were depicted by him\r\nin fresco on the facade of the palace, since no fewer than eighty\r\nhad been condemned to death. We have no means of knowing whether,\r\nbesides Botticelli, any other painters, perhaps Leonardo, was\r\ncommissioned, when the criminals had been hanged in person out of\r\nthe windows of the Palazzo del Podestà to represent them there\r\nafterwards in effigy in memory of their disgrace.

Then let it be shown how he first mounted on\r\nhorseback in armour; and the whole army came after him--40 squadrons\r\nof cavalry, and 2000 foot soldiers went with him. Very early in the\r\nmorning the Patriarch went up a hill to reconnoitre the country,\r\nthat is the hills, fields and the valley watered by a river; and\r\nfrom thence he beheld Niccolo Picinino coming from Borgo San\r\nSepolcro with his people, and with a great dust; and perceiving them\r\nhe returned to the camp of his own people and addressed them. Having\r\nspoken he prayed to God with clasped hands, when there appeared a\r\ncloud in which Saint Peter appeared and spoke to the Patriarch.--500\r\ncavalry were sent forward by the Patriarch to hinder or check the\r\nrush of the enemy. In the foremost troop Francesco the son of\r\nNiccolo Piccinino [24] was the first to attack the bridge which was\r\nheld by the Patriarch and the Florentines. Beyond the bridge to his\r\nleft he sent forward some infantry to engage ours, who drove them\r\nback, among whom was their captain Micheletto [29] whose lot it was\r\nto be that day at the head of the army. Here, at this bridge there\r\nis a severe struggle; our men conquer and the enemy is repulsed. Here Guido and Astorre, his brother, the Lord of Faenza with a great\r\nnumber of men, re-formed and renewed the fight, and rushed upon the\r\nFlorentines with such force that they recovered the bridge and\r\npushed forward as far as the tents. But Simonetto advanced with 600\r\nhorse, and fell upon the enemy and drove them back once more from\r\nthe place, and recaptured the bridge; and behind him came more men\r\nwith 2000 horse soldiers. And thus for a long time they fought with\r\nvarying fortune. But then the Patriarch, in order to divert the\r\nenemy, sent forward Niccolo da Pisa [44] and Napoleone Orsino, a\r\nbeardless lad, followed by a great multitude of men, and then was\r\ndone another great feat of arms. At the same time Niccolo Piccinino\r\nurged forward the remnant of his men, who once more made ours give\r\nway; and if it had not been that the Patriarch set himself at their\r\nhead and, by his words and deeds controlled the captains, our\r\nsoldiers would have taken to flight. The Patriarch had some\r\nartillery placed on the hill and with these he dispersed the enemy's\r\ninfantry; and the disorder was so complete that Niccolo began to\r\ncall back his son and all his men, and they took to flight towards\r\nBorgo. And then began a great slaughter of men; none escaped but the\r\nforemost of those who had fled or who hid themselves. The battle\r\ncontinued until sunset, when the Patriarch gave his mind to\r\nrecalling his men and burying the dead, and afterwards a trophy was\r\nerected. [Footnote: 669.

In his diary he designates them simply\r\nas \"_Die sechs Knoten_\" (see THAUSING, Life of A. Dürer I, 362,\r\n363). In Leonardo's MSS. we find here and there little sketches or\r\nsuggestions for similar ornaments. Compare too G. MONGERI, _L'Arte\r\nin Milano_, p. 315 where an ornament of the same character is given\r\nfrom the old decorations of the vaulted ceiling of the Sacristy of\r\nS. Maria delle Grazie.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 680, 17.

The notes on Sculpture. Compared with the mass of manuscript treating of Painting, a very\r\nsmall number of passages bearing on the practice and methods of\r\nSculpture are to be found scattered through the note books; these\r\nare here given at the beginning of this section (Nos. 706-709). There is less cause for surprise at finding that the equestrian\r\nstatue of Francesco Sforza is only incidentally spoken of; for,\r\nalthough Leonardo must have worked at it for a long succession of\r\nyears, it is not in the nature of the case that it could have given\r\nrise to much writing. We may therefore regard it as particularly\r\nfortunate that no fewer than thirteen notes in the master's\r\nhandwriting can be brought together, which seem to throw light on\r\nthe mysterious history of this famous work. Until now writers on\r\nLeonardo were acquainted only with the passages numbered 712, 719,\r\n720, 722 and 723. In arranging these notes on sculpture I have given the precedence to\r\nthose which treat of the casting of the monument, not merely because\r\nthey are the fullest, but more especially with a view to\r\nreconstructing the monument, an achievement which really almost lies\r\nwithin our reach by combining and comparing the whole of the\r\nmaterials now brought to light, alike in notes and in sketches. A good deal of the first two passages, Nos. 710 and 711, which refer\r\nto this subject seems obscure and incomprehensible; still, they\r\nsupplement each other and one contributes in no small degree to the\r\ncomprehension of the other. A very interesting and instructive\r\ncommentary on these passages may be found in the fourth chapter of\r\nVasari's Introduzione della Scultura under the title \"Come si fanno\r\ni modelli per fare di bronzo le figure grandi e picciole, e come le\r\nforme per buttarle; come si armino di ferri, e come si gettino di\r\nmetallo,\" &c. Among the drawings of models of the moulds for casting\r\nwe find only one which seems to represent the horse in the act of\r\ngalloping--No. 713. All the other designs show the horse as pacing\r\nquietly and as these studies of the horse are accompanied by copious\r\nnotes as to the method of casting, the question as to the position\r\nof the horse in the model finally selected, seems to be decided by\r\npreponderating evidence. \"Il cavallo dello Sforza\"--C. Boito remarks\r\nvery appositely in the Saggio on page 26, \"doveva sembrare fratello\r\nal cavallo del Colleoni. E si direbbe che questo fosse figlio del\r\ncavallo del Gattamelata, il quale pare figlio di uno dei quattro\r\ncavalli che stavano forse sull' Arco di Nerone in Roma\" (now at\r\nVenice).

The only important point here is\r\nto prove that strong evidence seems to show that, of the numerous\r\nstudies for the equestrian statue, only those which represent the\r\nhorse pacing agree with the schemes of the final plans. The second group of preparatory sketches, representing the horse as\r\ngalloping, must therefore be considered separately, a distinction\r\nwhich, in recapitulating the history of the origin of the monument\r\nseems justified by the note given under No. 720. Galeazza Maria Sforza was assassinated in 1476 before his scheme for\r\nerecting a monument to his father Francesco Sforza could be carried\r\ninto effect. In the following year Ludovico il Moro the young\r\naspirant to the throne was exiled to Pisa, and only returned to\r\nMilan in 1479 when he was Lord (Governatore) of the State of Milan,\r\nin 1480 after the minister Cecco Simonetta had been murdered. It may\r\nhave been soon after this that Ludovico il Moro announced a\r\ncompetition for an equestrian statue, and it is tolerably certain\r\nthat Antonio del Pollajuolo took part in it, from this passage in\r\nVasari's Life of this artist: \"E si trovo, dopo la morte sua, il\r\ndisegno e modello che a Lodovico Sforza egli aveva fatto per la\r\nstatua a cavallo di Francesco Sforza, duca di Milano; il quale\r\ndisegno e nel nostro Libro, in due modi: in uno egli ha sotto\r\nVerona; nell'altro, egli tutto armato, e sopra un basamento pieno di\r\nbattaglie, fa saltare il cavallo addosso a un armato; ma la cagione\r\nperche non mettesse questi disegni in opera, non ho gia potuto\r\nsapere.\" One of Pollajuolo's drawings, as here described, has lately\r\nbeen discovered by Senatore Giovanni Morelli in the Munich\r\nPinacothek. Here the profile of the horseman is a portrait of\r\nFrancesco Duke of Milan, and under the horse, who is galloping to\r\nthe left, we see a warrior thrown and lying on the ground; precisely\r\nthe same idea as we find in some of Leonardo's designs for the\r\nmonument, as on Pl. LXVI, LXVII, LXVIII, LXIX and LXXII No. 1; and,\r\nas it is impossible to explain this remarkable coincidence by\r\nsupposing that either artist borrowed it from the other, we can only\r\nconclude that in the terms of the competition the subject proposed\r\nwas the Duke on a horse in full gallop, with a fallen foe under its\r\nhoofs. Leonardo may have been in the competition there and then, but the\r\nmeans for executing the monument do not seem to have been at once\r\nforthcoming. It was not perhaps until some years later that Leonardo\r\nin a letter to the Duke (No. 719) reminded him of the project for\r\nthe monument. Then, after he had obeyed a summons to Milan, the plan\r\nseems to have been so far modified, perhaps in consequence of a\r\nremonstrance on the part of the artist, that a pacing horse was\r\nsubstituted for one galloping, and it may have been at the same time\r\nthat the colossal dimensions of the statue were first decided on. The designs given on Pl. LXX, LXXI, LXXII, 2 and 3, LXXIII and LXXIV\r\nand on pp. 4 and 24, as well as three sketches on Pl. LXIX may be\r\nstudied with reference to the project in its new form, though it is\r\nhardly possible to believe that in either of these we see the design\r\nas it was actually carried out.

In 1473 Pope Sixtus\r\nIV had this antique equestrian statue restored and placed on a new\r\npedestal in front of the church of San Giovanni in Luterano. Leonardo, although he was painting independently as early as in 1472\r\nis still spoken of as working in Verrocchio's studio in 1477. Two\r\nyears later the Venetian senate decided on erecting an equestrian\r\nstatue to Colleoni; and as Verrocchio, to whom the work was\r\nentrusted, did not at once move from Florence to Venice--where he\r\ndied in 1488 before the casting was completed--but on the contrary\r\nremained in Florence for some years, perhaps even till 1485,\r\nLeonardo probably had the opportunity of seeing all his designs for\r\nthe equestrian statue at Venice and the red chalk drawing on Pl. LXXIV may be a reminiscence of it. The pen and ink drawing on Pl. LXXII, No. 3, reminds us of\r\nDonatello's statue of Gattamelata at Padua. However it does not\r\nappear that Leonardo was ever at Padua before 1499, but we may\r\nconclude that he took a special interest in this early bronze statue\r\nand the reports he could procure of it, form an incidental remark\r\nwhich is to be found in C. A. 145a; 432a, and which will be given in\r\nVol. II under Ricordi or Memoranda. Among the studies--in the widest\r\nsense of the word--made in preparation statue we may include the\r\nAnatomy of the Horse which Lomazzo and Vas mention; the most\r\nimportant parts of this work still exist in the Queen's Li Windsor. It was beyond a doubt compiled by Leonardo when at Milan; only\r\ninteresting records to be found among these designs are reproduced\r\nin Nos. 716a but it must be pointed out that out of 40 sheets of\r\nstudies of the movements of the belonging to that treatise, a horse\r\nin full gallop occurs but once. If we may trust the account given by Paulus Jovius--about l527--\r\nLeonardo's horse was represented as \"vehementer incitatus et\r\nanhelatus\". Jovius had probably seen the model exhibited at Milan;\r\nbut, need we, in fact, infer from this description that the horse\r\nwas galloping? Compare Vasari's description of the Gattamelata\r\nmonument at Padua: \"Egli [Donatello] vi ando ben volentieri, e fece\r\nil cavallo di bronzo, che e in sulla piazza di Sant Antonio, nel\r\nquale si dimostra lo sbuffamento ed il fremito del cavallo, ed il\r\ngrande animo e la fierezza vivacissimamente espressa dall'arte nella\r\nfigura che lo cavalca\". These descriptions, it seems to me, would only serve to mark the\r\ndifference between the work of the middle ages and that of the\r\nrenaissance. We learn from a statement of Sabba da Castiglione that, when Milan\r\nwas taken by the French in 1499, the model sustained some injury;\r\nand this informant, who, however is not invariably trustworthy, adds\r\nthat Leonardo had devoted fully sixteen years to this work (la forma\r\ndel cavallo, intorno a cui Leonardo avea sedici anni continui\r\nconsumati). This often-quoted passage has given ground for an\r\nassumption, which has no other evidence to support it, that Leonardo\r\nhad lived in Milan ever since 1483. But I believe it is nearer the\r\ntruth to suppose that this author's statement alludes to the fact\r\nthat about sixteen years must have past since the competition in\r\nwhich Leonardo had taken part. I must in these remarks confine myself strictly to the task in hand\r\nand give no more of the history of the Sforza monument than is\r\nneeded to explain the texts and drawings I have been able to\r\nreproduce. In the first place, with regard to the drawings, I may\r\nobserve that they are all, with the following two exceptions, in the\r\nQueen's Library at Windsor Castle; the red chalk drawing on Pl.

LXVI have undergone a trifling\r\nreduction from the size of the originals. There can no longer be the slightest doubt that the well-known\r\nengraving of several horsemen (Passavant, Le Peintre-Graveur, Vol. V, p. 181, No. 3) is only a copy after original drawings by\r\nLeonardo, executed by some unknown engraver; we have only to compare\r\nthe engraving with the facsimiles of drawings on Pl. LXV, No. 2, Pl. LXVII, LXVIII and LXIX which, it is quite evident, have served as\r\nmodels for the engraver. On Pl. LXV No. 1, in the larger sketch to the right hand, only the\r\nbase is distinctly visible, the figure of the horseman is effaced. Leonardo evidently found it unsatisfactory and therefore rubbed it\r\nout. The base of the monument--the pedestal for the equestrian statue--is\r\nrepeatedly sketched on a magnificent plan. In the sketch just\r\nmentioned it has the character of a shrine or aedicula to contain a\r\nsarcophagus. Captives in chains are here represented on the\r\nentablature with their backs turned to that portion of the monument\r\nwhich more\r\n\r\nstrictly constitutes the pedestal of the horse. The lower portion of\r\nthe aedicula is surrounded by columns. In the pen and ink drawing\r\nPl. LXVI--the lower drawing on the right hand side--the sarcophagus\r\nis shown between the columns, and above the entablature is a plinth\r\non which the horse stands. But this arrangement perhaps seemed to\r\nLeonardo to lack solidity, and in the little sketch on the left\r\nhand, below, the sarcophagus is shown as lying under an arched\r\ncanopy. In this the trophies and the captive warriors are detached\r\nfrom the angles. In the first of these two sketches the place for\r\nthe trophies is merely indicated by a few strokes; in the third\r\nsketch on the left the base is altogether broader, buttresses and\r\npinnacles having been added so as to form three niches. The black\r\nchalk drawing on Pl. LXVIII shows a base in which the angles are\r\nformed by niches with pilasters. In the little sketch to the extreme\r\nleft on Pl. LXV, No. 1, the equestrian statue serves to crown a\r\ncircular temple somewhat resembling Bramante's tempietto of San\r\nPietro in Montario at Rome, while the sketch above to the right\r\ndisplays an arrangement faintly reminding us of the tomb of the\r\nScaligers in Verona. The base is thus constructed of two platforms\r\nor slabs, the upper one considerably smaller than the lower one\r\nwhich is supported on flying buttresses with pinnacles. On looking over the numerous studies in which the horse is not\r\ngalloping but merely walking forward, we find only one drawing for\r\nthe pedestal, and this, to accord with the altered character of the\r\nstatue, is quieter and simpler in style (Pl. LXXIV). It rises almost\r\nvertically from the ground and is exactly as long as the pacing\r\nhorse. The whole base is here arranged either as an independent\r\nbaldaquin or else as a projecting canopy over a recess in which the\r\nfigure of the deceased Duke is seen lying on his sarcophagus; in the\r\nlatter case it was probably intended as a tomb inside a church. Here, too, it was intended to fill the angles with trophies or\r\ncaptive warriors. Probably only No. 724 in the text refers to the\r\nwork for the base of the monument. If we compare the last mentioned sketch with the description of a\r\nplan for an equestrian monument to Gian Giacomo Trivulzio (No. 725)\r\nit seems by no means impossible that this drawing is a preparatory\r\nstudy for the very monument concerning which the manuscript gives us\r\ndetailed information. We have no historical record regarding this\r\nsketch nor do the archives in the Trivulzio Palace give us any\r\ninformation. The simple monument to the great general in San Nazaro\r\nMaggiore in Milan consists merely of a sarcophagus placed in recess\r\nhigh on the wall of an octagonal chapel.

This passage is taken\r\nfrom a note book which can be proved to have been used in Rome.]\r\n\r\nAll coins which do not have the rim complete, are not to be accepted\r\nas good; and to secure the perfection of their rim it is requisite\r\nthat, in the first place, all the coins should be a perfect circle;\r\nand to do this a coin must before all be made perfect in weight, and\r\nsize, and thickness. Therefore have several plates of metal made of\r\nthe same size and thickness, all drawn through the same gauge so as\r\nto come out in strips. And out of [24] these strips you will stamp\r\nthe coins, quite round, as sieves are made for sorting chestnuts\r\n[27]; and these coins can then be stamped in the way indicated\r\nabove; &c. [31] The hollow of the die must be uniformly wider than the lower,\r\nbut imperceptibly [35]. This cuts the coins perfectly round and of the exact thickness, and\r\nweight; and saves the man who cuts and weighs, and the man who makes\r\nthe coins round. Hence it passes only through the hands of the\r\ngauger and of the stamper, and the coins are very superior. [Footnote: See Pl. LXXVI No. 2. The text of lines 31-35 stands\r\nparallel 1. 24-27.

OF TAKING CASTS OF MEDALS. A paste of emery mixed with aqua vitae, or iron filings with\r\nvinegar, or ashes of walnut leaves, or ashes of straw very finely\r\npowdered. [Footnote: The meaning of _scagliuolo_ in this passage is doubtful.]\r\n\r\nThe diameter is given in the lead enclosed; it is beaten with a\r\nhammer and several times extended; the lead is folded and kept\r\nwrapped up in parchment so that the powder may not be spilt; then\r\nmelt the lead, and the powder will be on the top of the melted lead,\r\nwhich must then be rubbed between two plates of steel till it is\r\nthoroughly pulverised; then wash it with aqua fortis, and the\r\nblackness of the iron will be dissolved leaving the powder clean. Emery in large grains may be broken by putting it on a cloth many\r\ntimes doubled, and hit it sideways with the hammer, when it will\r\nbreak up; then mix it little by little and it can be founded with\r\nease; but if you hold it on the anvil you will never break it, when\r\nit is large. Any one who grinds smalt should do it on plates of tempered steel\r\nwith a cone shaped grinder; then put it in aqua fortis, which melts\r\naway the steel that may have been worked up and mixed with the\r\nsmalt, and which makes it black; it then remains purified and clean;\r\nand if you grind it on porphyry the porphyry will work up and mix\r\nwith the smalt and spoil it, and aqua fortis will never remove it\r\nbecause it cannot dissolve the porphyry. If you want a fine blue colour dissolve the smalt made with tartar,\r\nand then remove the salt. Vitrified brass makes a fine red. 729. STUCCO. Place stucco over the prominence of the..... which may be composed\r\nof Venus and Mercury, and lay it well over that prominence of the\r\nthickness of the side of a knife, made with the ruler and cover this\r\nwith the bell of a still, and you will have again the moisture with\r\nwhich you applied the paste. The rest you may dry [Margin note: On\r\nstucco (729. 730).] [Footnote: In this passage a few words have been\r\nwritten in a sort of cipher--that is to say backwards; as in l. 3\r\n_erenev_ for _Venere_, l. 4 _oirucrem_ for Mercurio, l. 12 _il\r\norreve co ecarob_ for _il everro (?) co borace_.

Make a bunch of iron wire as thick as thread, and scrub them with\r\n[this and] water; hold a bowl underneath that it may not make a mud\r\nbelow. HOW TO REMOVE THE ROUGH EDGES FROM BRONZE. Make an iron rod, after the manner of a large chisel, and with this\r\nrub over those seams on the bronze which remain on the casts of the\r\nguns, and which are caused by the joins in the mould; but make the\r\ntool heavy enough, and let the strokes be long and broad. TO FACILITATE MELTING. First alloy part of the metal in the crucible, then put it in the\r\nfurnace, and this being in a molten state will assist in beginning\r\nto melt the copper. TO PREVENT THE COPPER COOLING IN THE FURNACE. When the copper cools in the furnace, be ready, as soon as you\r\nperceive it, to cut it with a long stick while it is still in a\r\npaste; or if it is quite cold cut it as lead is cut with broad and\r\nlarge chisels. IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LARGE CAST. If you have to make a cast of a hundred thousand pounds do it with\r\ntwo furnaces and with 2000 pounds in each, or as much as 3000 pounds\r\nat most. 738. HOW TO PROCEED TO BREAK A LARGE MASS OF BRONZE. If you want to break up a large mass of bronze, first suspend it,\r\nand then make round it a wall on the four sides, like a trough of\r\nbricks, and make a great fire therein. When it is quite red hot give\r\nit a blow with a heavy weight raised above it, and with great force. 739. TO COMBINE LEAD WITH OTHER METAL. If you wish for economy in combining lead with the metal in order to\r\nlessen the amount of tin which is necessary in the metal, first\r\nalloy the lead with the tin and then add the molten copper. How TO MELT [METAL] IN A FURNACE. The furnace should be between four well founded pillars. OF THE THICKNESS OF THE COATING. The coating should not be more than two fingers thick, it should be\r\nlaid on in four thicknesses over fine clay and then well fixed, and\r\nit should be fired only on the inside and then carefully covered\r\nwith ashes and cow's dung. OF THE THICKNESS OF THE GUN. The gun being made to carry 600 Ibs. of ball and more, by this rule\r\nyou will take the measure of the diameter of the ball and divide it\r\ninto 6 parts and one of these parts will be its thickness at the\r\nmuzzle; but at the breech it must always be half. And if the ball is\r\nto be 700 lbs., 1/7th of the diameter of the ball must be its\r\nthickness in front; and if the ball is to be 800, the eighth of its\r\ndiameter in front; and if 900, 1/8th and 1/2 [3/16], and if 1000,\r\n1/9th. OF THE LENGTH OF THE BODY OF THE GUN. If you want it to throw a ball of stone, make the length of the gun\r\nto be 6, or as much as 7 diameters of the ball; and if the ball is\r\nto be of iron make it as much as 12 balls, and if the ball is to be\r\nof lead, make it as much as 18 balls. I mean when the gun is to have\r\nthe mouth fitted to receive 600 lbs. of stone ball, and more. OF THE THICKNESS OF SMALL GUNS. The thickness at the muzzle of small guns should be from a half to\r\none third of the diameter of the ball, and the length from 30 to 36\r\nballs. 740. OF LUTING THE FURNACE WITHIN.

This hypothesis has\r\nlately been confirmed by the publication of certain documents,\r\npreserved at Milan, showing that Leonardo was not only employed in\r\npreparing plans but that he took an active part, with much credit,\r\nas member of a commission on public buildings; his name remains\r\nlinked with the history of the building of the Cathedral at Pavia\r\nand that of the Cathedral at Milan._\r\n\r\n_Leonardo's writings on Architecture are dispersed among a large\r\nnumber of MSS., and it would be scarcely possible to master their\r\ncontents without the opportunity of arranging, sorting and comparing\r\nthe whole mass of materials, so as to have some comprehensive idea\r\nof the whole.

Here there cannot and ought not to be any _campanile_; on the\r\ncontrary it must stand apart like that of the Cathedral and of San\r\nGiovanni at Florence, and of the Cathedral at Pisa, where the\r\ncampanile is quite detached as well as the dome. Thus each can\r\ndisplay its own perfection. If however you wish to join it to the\r\nchurch, make the lantern serve for the campanile as in the church at\r\nChiaravalle. [Footnote: This text is written by the side of the plan given on Pl. XCI.

This subject has been more extensively treated by Leonardo in\r\ndrawings than in writing. Still we may fairly assume that it was his\r\npurpose, ultimately to embody the results of his investigation in a_\r\n\"Trattato delle Cupole.\" _The amount of materials is remarkably\r\nextensive. MS. B is particularly rich in plans and elevations of\r\nchurches with one or more domes--from the simplest form to the most\r\ncomplicated that can be imagined. Considering the evident connexion\r\nbetween a great number of these sketches, as well as the\r\nimpossibility of seeing in them designs or preparatory sketches for\r\nany building intended to be erected, the conclusion is obvious that\r\nthey were not designed for any particular monument, but were\r\ntheoretical and ideal researches, made in order to obtain a clear\r\nunderstanding of the laws which must govern the construction of a\r\ngreat central dome, with smaller ones grouped round it; and with or\r\nwithout the addition of spires, so that each of these parts by\r\nitself and in its juxtaposition to the other parts should produce\r\nthe grandest possible effect.

Leonardo's sketches show that he was fully aware, as was to be\r\nexpected, of this truth. Few of them exhibit the form of a Latin\r\ncross, and when this is met with, it generally gives evidence of the\r\ndetermination to assign as prominent a part as possible to the dome\r\nin the general effect of the building. While it is evident, on the one hand, that the greater number of\r\nthese domes had no particular purpose, not being designed for\r\nexecution, on the other hand several reasons may be found for\r\nLeonardo's perseverance in his studies of the subject. Besides the theoretical interest of the question for Leonardo and\r\nhis_ Trattato _and besides the taste for domes prevailing at that\r\ntime, it seems likely that the intended erection of some building of\r\nthe first importance like the Duomos of Pavia and Como, the church\r\nof Sta. Maria delle Grazie at Milan, and the construction of a Dome\r\nor central Tower_ (Tiburio) _on the cathedral of Milan, may have\r\nstimulated Leonardo to undertake a general and thorough\r\ninvestigation of the subject; whilst Leonardo's intercourse with\r\nBramante for ten years or more, can hardly have remained without\r\ninfluence in this matter. In fact now that some of this great\r\nArchitect's studies for S. Peter's at Rome have at last become\r\nknown, he must be considered henceforth as the greatest master of\r\nDome-Architecture that ever existed. His influence, direct or\r\nindirect even on a genius like Leonardo seems the more likely, since\r\nLeonardo's sketches reveal a style most similar to that of Bramante,\r\nwhose name indeed, occurs twice in Leonardo's manuscript notes. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that Leonardo was a Florentine; the\r\ncharacteristic form of the two principal domes of Florence, Sta. Maria del Fiore and the Battisterio, constantly appear as leading\r\nfeatures in his sketches. The church of San Lorenzo at Milan, was at that time still intact. The dome is to this day one of the most wonderful cupolas ever\r\nconstructed, and with its two smaller domes might well attract the\r\nattention and study of a never resting genius such as Leonardo. A\r\nwhole class of these sketches betray in fact the direct influence of\r\nthe church of S. Lorenzo, and this also seems to have suggested the\r\nplan of Bramante's dome of St. Peter's at Rome. In the following pages the various sketches for the construction of\r\ndomes have been classified and discussed from a general point of\r\nview. On two sheets: Pl. LXXXIV (C.A. 354b; 118a) and Pl. LXXXV,\r\nNos. 1-11 (Ash. II, 6b) we see various dissimilar types, grouped\r\ntogether; thus these two sheets may be regarded as a sort of\r\nnomenclature of the different types, on which we shall now have to\r\ntreat._\r\n\r\n_1.

In b) The chapels are dissimilar; those which terminate the\r\nprincipal axes being different in form from those which are added on\r\nthe diagonal sides of the octagon. a. First Class. The Chapel_ \"degli Angeli,\" _at Florence, built only to a height of\r\nabout 20 feet by Brunellesco, may be considered as the prototype of\r\nthis group; and, indeed it probably suggested it. The fact that we\r\nsee in MS. B. 11b (Pl. XCIV, No. 3) by the side of Brunellesco's\r\nplan for the Basilica of Sto. Spirito at Florence, a plan almost\r\nidentical with that of the_ Capella degli Angeli, _confirms this\r\nsupposition. Only two small differences, or we may say improvements,\r\nhave been introduced by Leonardo. Firstly the back of the chapels\r\ncontains a third niche, and each angle of the Octagon a folded\r\npilaster like those in Bramante's_ Sagrestia di S. M. presso San\r\nSatiro _at Milan, instead of an interval between the two pilasters\r\nas seen in the Battistero at Florence and in the Sacristy of Sto. Spirito in the same town and also in the above named chapel by\r\nBrunellesco. The first set of sketches which come under consideration have at\r\nfirst sight the appearance of mere geometrical studies. They seem to\r\nhave been suggested by the plan given on page 44 Fig. 2 (MS. B, 55a)\r\nin the centre of which is written_ \"Santa Maria in perticha da\r\nPavia\", _at the place marked A on the reproduction. a) (MS. B, 34b, page 44 Fig. 3). In the middle of each side a column\r\nis added, and in the axes of the intercolumnar spaces a second row\r\nof columns forms an aisle round the octagon. These are placed at the\r\nintersection of a system of semicircles, of which the sixteen\r\ncolumns on the sides of the octagon are the centres. b) The preceding diagram is completed and becomes more monumental in\r\nstyle in the sketch next to it (MS. B, 35a, see p. 45 Fig. 1). An\r\nouter aisle is added by circles, having for radius the distance\r\nbetween the columns in the middle sides of the octagon. c) (MS.

A. 266 IIb, 8l2b there is a plan almost identical with\r\nthat of San Lorenzo. The diagonal sides of the irregular octagon are\r\nnot indicated. If it could be proved that the arches which, in the actual church,\r\nexist on these sides in the first story, were added in 1574 by\r\nMartimo Bassi, then this plan and the following section would be\r\nstill nearer the original state of San Lorenzo than at present. A\r\nreproduction of this slightly sketched plan has not been possible. It may however be understood from Pl. LXXXVIII No. 3, by suppressing\r\nthe four pillars corresponding to the apses. Pl. LXXXVII No. 1 shows the section in elevation corresponding with\r\nthe above-named plan. The recessed chapels are decorated with large\r\nshells in the halfdomes like the arrangement in San Lorenzo, but\r\nwith proportions like those of Bramante's Sacristy of Santa Maria\r\npresso S. Satiro. MS. C. A. 266; a sheet containing three views of exteriors of Domes. On the same sheet there is a plan similar to the one above-named but\r\nwith uninterrupted aisles and with the addition of round chapels in\r\nthe axes (compare Pl. XCVII No. 3 and page 44 Fig. 1), perhaps a\r\nreminiscence of the two chapels annexed to San Lorenzo.--Leonardo\r\nhas here sketched the way of transforming this plan into a Latin\r\ncross by means of a nave with side aisles. Pl. XCI No. 1. Plan showing a type deprived of aisles and comprised\r\nin a square building which is surrounded by a portico. It is\r\naccompanied by the following text:_\r\n\r\n756.

On the left is a view of the exterior of the preceding plan. It is\r\naccompanied by the following note:_\r\n\r\n757. This building is inhabited below and above; the way up is by the\r\ncampaniles, and in going up one has to use the platform, where the\r\ndrums of the four domes are, and this platform has a parapet in\r\nfront, and none of these domes communicate with the church, but they\r\nare quite separate. _Pl.

Pl. XCVII No. 3 (MS. B. 52a). The central part is a development of\r\nS. Lorenzo at Milan, such as was executed at the Duomo of Pavia. There is sufficient analogy between the building actually executed\r\nand this sketch to suggest a direct connection between them. Leonardo accompanied Francesco di Giorgio[Footnote 3: See MALASPINA,\r\nil Duomo di Pavia. Documents.] when the latter was consulted on June\r\n21st, 1490 as to this church; the fact that the only word\r\naccompanying the plan is:_ \"sagrestia\", _seems to confirm our\r\nsupposition, for the sacristies were added only in 1492, i. e. four\r\nyears after the beginning of the Cathedral, which at that time was\r\nmost likely still sufficiently unfinished to be capable of receiving\r\nthe form of the present sketch.

FOR MAKING A CLEAN STABLE. The manner in which one must arrange a stable. You must first divide\r\nits width in 3 parts, its depth matters not; and let these 3\r\ndivisions be equal and 6 braccia broad for each part and 10 high,\r\nand the middle part shall be for the use of the stablemasters; the 2\r\nside ones for the horses, each of which must be 6 braccia in width\r\nand 6 in length, and be half a braccio higher at the head than\r\nbehind. Let the manger be at 2 braccia from the ground, to the\r\nbottom of the rack, 3 braccia, and the top of it 4 braccia. Now, in\r\norder to attain to what I promise, that is to make this place,\r\ncontrary to the general custom, clean and neat: as to the upper part\r\nof the stable, i. e. where the hay is, that part must have at its\r\nouter end a window 6 braccia high and 6 broad, through which by\r\nsimple means the hay is brought up to the loft, as is shown by the\r\nmachine _E_; and let this be erected in a place 6 braccia wide, and\r\nas long as the stable, as seen at _k p_. The other two parts, which\r\nare on either side of this, are again divided; those nearest to the\r\nhay-loft are 4 braccia, _p s_, and only for the use and circulation\r\nof the servants belonging to the stable; the other two which reach\r\nto the outer walls are 2 braccia, as seen at _s k_, and these are\r\nmade for the purpose of giving hay to the mangers, by means of\r\nfunnels, narrow at the top and wide over the manger, in order that\r\nthe hay should not choke them. They must be well plastered and clean\r\nand are represented at 4 _f s_. As to the giving the horses water,\r\nthe troughs must be of stone and above them [cisterns of] water. The\r\nmangers may be opened as boxes are uncovered by raising the lids. [Footnote: See Pl. LXXVIII, No.1.]\r\n\r\nDecorations for feasts. 762. THE WAY TO CONSTRUCT A FRAME-WORK FOR DECORATING BUILDINGS. The way in which the poles ought to be placed for tying bunches of\r\njuniper on to them. These poles must lie close to the framework of\r\nthe vaulting and tie the bunches on with osier withes, so as to clip\r\nthem even afterwards with shears. Let the distance from one circle to another be half a braccia; and\r\nthe juniper [sprigs] must lie top downwards, beginning from below. Round this column tie four poles to which willows about as thick as\r\na finger must be nailed and then begin from the bottom and work\r\nupwards with bunches of juniper sprigs, the tops downwards, that is\r\nupside down.

They might all be collected under the one title: \"Studies\r\non the Strength of Materials\".

First write the treatise on the causes of the giving way of walls\r\nand then, separately, treat of the remedies. Parallel fissures constantly occur in buildings which are erected on\r\na hill side, when the hill is composed of stratified rocks with an\r\noblique stratification, because water and other moisture often\r\npenetrates these oblique seams carrying in greasy and slippery soil;\r\nand as the strata are not continuous down to the bottom of the\r\nvalley, the rocks slide in the direction of the slope, and the\r\nmotion does not cease till they have reached the bottom of the\r\nvalley, carrying with them, as though in a boat, that portion of the\r\nbuilding which is separated by them from the rest. The remedy for\r\nthis is always to build thick piers under the wall which is\r\nslipping, with arches from one to another, and with a good scarp and\r\nlet the piers have a firm foundation in the strata so that they may\r\nnot break away from them. In order to find the solid part of these strata, it is necessary to\r\nmake a shaft at the foot of the wall of great depth through the\r\nstrata; and in this shaft, on the side from which the hill slopes,\r\nsmooth and flatten a space one palm wide from the top to the bottom;\r\nand after some time this smooth portion made on the side of the\r\nshaft, will show plainly which part of the hill is moving. [Footnote: See Pl. CIV.]\r\n\r\n771. The cracks in walls will never be parallel unless the part of the\r\nwall that separates from the remainder does not slip down. WHAT IS THE LAW BY WHICH BUILDINGS HAVE STABILITY. The stability of buildings is the result of the contrary law to the\r\ntwo former cases. That is to say that the walls must be all built up\r\nequally, and by degrees, to equal heights all round the building,\r\nand the whole thickness at once, whatever kind of walls they may be. And although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one it will\r\nnot necessarily give way under the added weight day by day and thus,\r\n[16] although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one, it\r\nwill not give way under the weight which the latter may acquire from\r\nday to day.

The reason is, that the brick _a_ has\r\nabove it only the weight _a k_, whilst the last brick under the arch\r\nhas above it the weight _c d x a_. _c d_ seems to press on the arch towards the abutment at the point\r\n_p_ but the weight _p o_ opposes resistence to it, whence the whole\r\npressure is transmitted to the root of the arch. Therefore the foot\r\nof the arch acts like 7 6, which is more than double of _x z_. II. ON FISSURES IN NICHES. 777. ON FISSURES IN NICHES. An arch constructed on a semicircle and bearing weights on the two\r\nopposite thirds of its curve will give way at five points of the\r\ncurve. To prove this let the weights be at _n m_ which will break\r\nthe arch _a_, _b_, _f_. I say that, by the foregoing, as the\r\nextremities _c_ and _a_ are equally pressed upon by the thrust _n_,\r\nit follows, by the 5th, that the arch will give way at the point\r\nwhich is furthest from the two forces acting on them and that is the\r\nmiddle _e_. The same is to be understood of the opposite curve, _d g\r\nb_; hence the weights _n m_ must sink, but they cannot sink by the\r\n7th, without coming closer together, and they cannot come together\r\nunless the extremities of the arch between them come closer, and if\r\nthese draw together the crown of the arch must break; and thus the\r\narch will give way in two places as was at first said &c. I ask, given a weight at _a_ what counteracts it in the direction\r\n_n_ _f_ and by what weight must the weight at _f_ be counteracted. 778. ON THE SHRINKING OF DAMP BODIES OF DIFFERENT THICKNESS AND WIDTH. The window _a_ is the cause of the crack at _b_; and this crack is\r\nincreased by the pressure of _n_ and _m_ which sink or penetrate\r\ninto the soil in which foundations are built more than the lighter\r\nportion at _b_. Besides, the old foundation under _b_ has already\r\nsettled, and this the piers _n_ and _m_ have not yet done. Hence the\r\npart _b_ does not settle down perpendicularly; on the contrary, it\r\nis thrown outwards obliquely, and it cannot on the contrary be\r\nthrown inwards, because a portion like this, separated from the main\r\nwall, is larger outside than inside and the main wall, where it is\r\nbroken, is of the same shape and is also larger outside than inside;\r\ntherefore, if this separate portion were to fall inwards the larger\r\nwould have to pass through the smaller--which is impossible.

The cube placed on the pavement diminishes more in height than in\r\nbreadth, which the cube above, hanging in the air, cannot do. Thus\r\nit is proved. The cube shown above is better shown here below. The final result of the two cylinders of damp clay that is _a_ and\r\n_b_ will be the pyramidal figures below _c_ and _d_. This is proved\r\nthus: The cylinder _a_ resting on block of stone being made of clay\r\nmixed with a great deal of water will sink by its weight, which\r\npresses on its base, and in proportion as it settles and spreads all\r\nthe parts will be somewhat nearer to the base because that is\r\ncharged with the whole weight. III. ON THE NATURE OF THE ARCH. 779. WHAT IS AN ARCH? The arch is nothing else than a force originated by two weaknesses,\r\nfor the arch in buildings is composed of two segments of a circle,\r\neach of which being very weak in itself tends to fall; but as each\r\nopposes this tendency in the other, the two weaknesses combine to\r\nform one strength. OF THE KIND OF PRESSURE IN ARCHES. As the arch is a composite force it remains in equilibrium because\r\nthe thrust is equal from both sides; and if one of the segments\r\nweighs more than the other the stability is lost, because the\r\ngreater pressure will outweigh the lesser. OF DISTRIBUTING THE PRESSURE ABOVE AN ARCH. Next to giving the segments of the circle equal weight it is\r\nnecessary to load them equally, or you will fall into the same\r\ndefect as before. WHERE AN ARCH BREAKS. An arch breaks at the part which lies below half way from the\r\ncentre. SECOND RUPTURE OF THE ARCH. If the excess of weight be placed in the middle of the arch at the\r\npoint _a_, that weight tends to fall towards _b_, and the arch\r\nbreaks at 2/3 of its height at _c e_; and _g e_ is as many times\r\nstronger than _e a_, as _m o_ goes into _m n_. ON ANOTHER CAUSE OF RUIN. The arch will likewise give way under a transversal thrust, for when\r\nthe charge is not thrown directly on the foot of the arch, the arch\r\nlasts but a short time. 780. ON THE STRENGTH OF THE ARCH. The way to give stability to the arch is to fill the spandrils with\r\ngood masonry up to the level of its summit. ON THE LOADING OF ROUND ARCHES. ON THE PROPER MANNER OF LOADING THE POINTED ARCH. ON THE EVIL EFFECTS OF LOADING THE POINTED ARCH DIRECTLY ABOVE ITS\r\nCROWN.

ON THE REMEDY FOR EARTHQUAKES. The arch which throws its pressure perpendicularly on the abutments\r\nwill fulfil its function whatever be its direction, upside down,\r\nsideways or upright. The arch will not break if the chord of the outer arch does not\r\ntouch the inner arch. This is manifest by experience, because\r\nwhenever the chord _a o n_ of the outer arch _n r a_ approaches the\r\ninner arch _x b y_ the arch will be weak, and it will be weaker in\r\nproportion as the inner arch passes beyond that chord. When an arch\r\nis loaded only on one side the thrust will press on the top of the\r\nother side and be transmitted to the spring of the arch on that\r\nside; and it will break at a point half way between its two\r\nextremes, where it is farthest from the chord. 782. A continuous body which has been forcibly bent into an arch, thrusts\r\nin the direction of the straight line, which it tends to recover. 783. In an arch judiciously weighted the thrust is oblique, so that the\r\ntriangle _c n b_ has no weight upon it. 784. I here ask what weight will be needed to counterpoise and resist the\r\ntendency of each of these arches to give way? [Footnote: The two lower sketches are taken from the MS. S. K. M. III, 10a; they have there no explanatory text.]\r\n\r\n785. ON THE STRENGTH OF THE ARCH IN ARCHITECTURE. The stability of the arch built by an architect resides in the tie\r\nand in the flanks. ON THE POSITION OF THE TIE IN THE ABOVE NAMED ARCH. The position of the tie is of the same importance at the beginning\r\nof the arch and at the top of the perpendicular pier on which it\r\nrests. This is proved by the 2nd \"of supports\" which says: that part\r\nof a support has least resistance which is farthest from its solid\r\nattachment; hence, as the top of the pier is farthest from the\r\nmiddle of its true foundation and the same being the case at the\r\nopposite extremities of the arch which are the points farthest from\r\nthe middle, which is really its [upper] attachment, we have\r\nconcluded that the tie _a b_ requires to be in such a position as\r\nthat its opposite ends are between the four above-mentioned\r\nextremes. The adversary says that this arch must be more than half a circle,\r\nand that then it will not need a tie, because then the ends will not\r\nthrust outwards but inwards, as is seen in the excess at _a c_, _b\r\nd_. To this it must be answered that this would be a very poor\r\ndevice, for three reasons. The first refers to the strength of the\r\narch, since it is proved that the circular parallel being composed\r\nof two semicircles will only break where these semicircles cross\r\neach other, as is seen in the figure _n m;_ besides this it follows\r\nthat there is a wider space between the extremes of the semicircle\r\nthan between the plane of the walls; the third reason is that the\r\nweight placed to counterbalance the strength of the arch diminishes\r\nin proportion as the piers of the arch are wider than the space\r\nbetween the piers. Fourthly in proportion as the parts at _c a b d_\r\nturn outwards, the piers are weaker to support the arch above them. The 5th is that all the material and weight of the arch which are in\r\nexcess of the semicircle are useless and indeed mischievous; and\r\nhere it is to be noted that the weight placed above the arch will be\r\nmore likely to break the arch at _a b_, where the curve of the\r\nexcess begins that is added to the semicircle, than if the pier were\r\nstraight up to its junction with the semicircle [spring of the\r\narch].

ON THE STRENGTH AND NATURE OF ARCHES, AND WHERE THEY ARE STRONG OR\r\nWEAK; AND THE SAME AS TO COLUMNS. That part of the arch which is nearer to the horizontal offers least\r\nresistance to the weight placed on it. When the triangle _a z n_, by settling, drives backwards the 2/3 of\r\neach 1/2 circle that is _a s_ and in the same way _z m_, the reason\r\nis that _a_ is perpendicularly over _b_ and so likewise _z_ is above\r\n_f_. Either half of an arch, if overweighted, will break at 2/3 of its\r\nheight, the point which corresponds to the perpendicular line above\r\nthe middle of its bases, as is seen at _a b_; and this happens\r\nbecause the weight tends to fall past the point _r_.--And if,\r\nagainst its nature it should tend to fall towards the point _s_ the\r\narch _n s_ would break precisely in its middle. If the arch _n s_\r\nwere of a single piece of timber, if the weight placed at _n_ should\r\ntend to fall in the line _n m_, the arch would break in the middle\r\nof the arch _e m_, otherwise it will break at one third from the top\r\nat the point a because from _a_ to _n_ the arch is nearer to the\r\nhorizontal than from _a_ to _o_ and from _o_ to _s_, in proportion\r\nas _p t_ is greater than _t n_, _a o_ will be stronger than _a n_\r\nand likewise in proportion as _s o_ is stronger than _o a_, _r p_\r\nwill be greater than _p t_. The arch which is doubled to four times of its thickness will bear\r\nfour times the weight that the single arch could carry, and more in\r\nproportion as the diameter of its thickness goes a smaller number of\r\ntimes into its length. That is to say that if the thickness of the\r\nsingle arch goes ten times into its length, the thickness of the\r\ndoubled arch will go five times into its length. Hence as the\r\nthickness of the double arch goes only half as many times into its\r\nlength as that of the single arch does, it is reasonable that it\r\nshould carry half as much more weight as it would have to carry if\r\nit were in direct proportion to the single arch. Hence as this\r\ndouble arch has 4 times the thickness of the single arch, it would\r\nseem that it ought to bear 4 times the weight; but by the above rule\r\nit is shown that it will bear exactly 8 times as much. THAT PIER, WHICH is CHARGED MOST UNEQUALLY, WILL SOONEST GIVE WAY. The column _c b_, being charged with an equal weight, [on each side]\r\nwill be most durable, and the other two outward columns require on\r\nthe part outside of their centre as much pressure as there is inside\r\nof their centre, that is, from the centre of the column, towards the\r\nmiddle of the arch. Arches which depend on chains for their support will not be very\r\ndurable. THAT ARCH WILL BE OF LONGER DURATION WHICH HAS A GOOD ABUTMENT\r\nOPPOSED TO ITS THRUST. The arch itself tends to fall. If the arch be 30 braccia and the\r\ninterval between the walls which carry it be 20, we know that 30\r\ncannot pass through the 20 unless 20 becomes likewise 30. Hence the\r\narch being crushed by the excess of weight, and the walls offering\r\ninsufficient resistance, part, and afford room between them, for the\r\nfall of the arch.", "sentences": ["This is proved by the 7th of this which says: The opposite ends of\r\nthe support are equally pressed upon by the weight suspended to\r\nthem; hence the weight shown at _f_ is felt at _b c_, that is half\r\nat each extremity; and by the third which says: in a support of\r\nequal strength [throughout] that portion will give way soonest which\r\nis farthest from its attachment; whence it follows that _d_ being\r\nequally distant from _f, e_ .....", "If the centering of the arch does not settle as the arch settles,\r\nthe mortar, as it dries, will shrink and detach itself from the\r\nbricks between which it was laid to keep them together; and as it\r\nthus leaves them disjoined the vault will remain loosely built, and\r\nthe rains will soon destroy it.", "786.", "ON THE STRENGTH AND NATURE OF ARCHES, AND WHERE THEY ARE STRONG OR\r\nWEAK; AND THE SAME AS TO COLUMNS.", "That part of the arch which is nearer to the horizontal offers least\r\nresistance to the weight placed on it.", "When the triangle _a z n_, by settling, drives backwards the 2/3 of\r\neach 1/2 circle that is _a s_ and in the same way _z m_, the reason\r\nis that _a_ is perpendicularly over _b_ and so likewise _z_ is above\r\n_f_.", "Either half of an arch, if overweighted, will break at 2/3 of its\r\nheight, the point which corresponds to the perpendicular line above\r\nthe middle of its bases, as is seen at _a b_; and this happens\r\nbecause the weight tends to fall past the point _r_.--And if,\r\nagainst its nature it should tend to fall towards the point _s_ the\r\narch _n s_ would break precisely in its middle.", "If the arch _n s_\r\nwere of a single piece of timber, if the weight placed at _n_ should\r\ntend to fall in the line _n m_, the arch would break in the middle\r\nof the arch _e m_, otherwise it will break at one third from the top\r\nat the point a because from _a_ to _n_ the arch is nearer to the\r\nhorizontal than from _a_ to _o_ and from _o_ to _s_, in proportion\r\nas _p t_ is greater than _t n_, _a o_ will be stronger than _a n_\r\nand likewise in proportion as _s o_ is stronger than _o a_, _r p_\r\nwill be greater than _p t_.", "The arch which is doubled to four times of its thickness will bear\r\nfour times the weight that the single arch could carry, and more in\r\nproportion as the diameter of its thickness goes a smaller number of\r\ntimes into its length.", "That is to say that if the thickness of the\r\nsingle arch goes ten times into its length, the thickness of the\r\ndoubled arch will go five times into its length.", "Hence as the\r\nthickness of the double arch goes only half as many times into its\r\nlength as that of the single arch does, it is reasonable that it\r\nshould carry half as much more weight as it would have to carry if\r\nit were in direct proportion to the single arch.", "Hence as this\r\ndouble arch has 4 times the thickness of the single arch, it would\r\nseem that it ought to bear 4 times the weight; but by the above rule\r\nit is shown that it will bear exactly 8 times as much.", "THAT PIER, WHICH is CHARGED MOST UNEQUALLY, WILL SOONEST GIVE WAY.", "The column _c b_, being charged with an equal weight, [on each side]\r\nwill be most durable, and the other two outward columns require on\r\nthe part outside of their centre as much pressure as there is inside\r\nof their centre, that is, from the centre of the column, towards the\r\nmiddle of the arch.", "Arches which depend on chains for their support will not be very\r\ndurable.", "THAT ARCH WILL BE OF LONGER DURATION WHICH HAS A GOOD ABUTMENT\r\nOPPOSED TO ITS THRUST.", "The arch itself tends to fall.", "If the arch be 30 braccia and the\r\ninterval between the walls which carry it be 20, we know that 30\r\ncannot pass through the 20 unless 20 becomes likewise 30.", "Hence the\r\narch being crushed by the excess of weight, and the walls offering\r\ninsufficient resistance, part, and afford room between them, for the\r\nfall of the arch."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_191", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 191)", "language": "it", "content": "But if you do not wish to strengthen the arch with an iron tie you\r\nmust give it such abutments as can resist the thrust; and you can do\r\nthis thus: fill up the spandrels _m n_ with stones, and direct the\r\nlines of the joints between them to the centre of the circle of the\r\narch, and the reason why this makes the arch durable is this. We\r\nknow very well that if the arch is loaded with an excess of weight\r\nabove its quarter as _a b_, the wall _f g_ will be thrust outwards\r\nbecause the arch would yield in that direction; if the other quarter\r\n_b c_ were loaded, the wall _f g_ would be thrust inwards, if it\r\nwere not for the line of stones _x y_ which resists this. 787. PLAN. Here it is shown how the arches made in the side of the octagon\r\nthrust the piers of the angles outwards, as is shown by the line _h\r\nc_ and by the line _t d_ which thrust out the pier _m_; that is they\r\ntend to force it away from the centre of such an octagon. 788. An Experiment to show that a weight placed on an arch does not\r\ndischarge itself entirely on its columns; on the contrary the\r\ngreater the weight placed on the arches, the less the arch transmits\r\nthe weight to the columns. The experiment is the following. Let a\r\nman be placed on a steel yard in the middle of the shaft of a well,\r\nthen let him spread out his hands and feet between the walls of the\r\nwell, and you will see him weigh much less on the steel yard; give\r\nhim a weight on the shoulders, you will see by experiment, that the\r\ngreater the weight you give him the greater effort he will make in\r\nspreading his arms and legs, and in pressing against the wall and\r\nthe less weight will be thrown on the steel yard. IV. ON FOUNDATIONS, THE NATURE OF THE GROUND AND SUPPORTS. 789. The first and most important thing is stability. As to the foundations of the component parts of temples and other\r\npublic buildings, the depths of the foundations must bear the same\r\nproportions to each other as the weight of material which is to be\r\nplaced upon them. Every part of the depth of earth in a given space is composed of\r\nlayers, and each layer is composed of heavier or lighter materials,\r\nthe lowest being the heaviest. And this can be proved, because these\r\nlayers have been formed by the sediment from water carried down to\r\nthe sea, by the current of rivers which flow into it. The heaviest\r\npart of this sediment was that which was first thrown down, and so\r\non by degrees; and this is the action of water when it becomes\r\nstagnant, having first brought down the mud whence it first flowed. And such layers of soil are seen in the banks of rivers, where their\r\nconstant flow has cut through them and divided one slope from the\r\nother to a great depth; where in gravelly strata the waters have run\r\noff, the materials have, in consequence, dried and been converted\r\ninto hard stone, and this happened most in what was the finest mud;\r\nwhence we conclude that every portion of the surface of the earth\r\nwas once at the centre of the earth, and _vice_versa_ &c. 790. The heaviest part of the foundations of buildings settles most, and\r\nleaves the lighter part above it separated from it. And the soil which is most pressed, if it be porous yields most. You should always make the foundations project equally beyond the\r\nweight of the walls and piers, as shown at _m a b_.

OF THE SUPPORTS. A pillar of which the thickness is increased will gain more than its\r\ndue strength, in direct proportion to what its loses in relative\r\nheight. EXAMPLE. If a pillar should be nine times as high as it is broad--that is to\r\nsay, if it is one braccio thick, according to rule it should be nine\r\nbraccia high--then, if you place 100 such pillars together in a mass\r\nthis will be ten braccia broad and 9 high; and if the first pillar\r\ncould carry 10000 pounds the second being only about as high as it\r\nis wide, and thus lacking 8 parts of its proper length, it, that is\r\nto say, each pillar thus united, will bear eight times more than\r\nwhen disconnected; that is to say, that if at first it would carry\r\nten thousand pounds, it would now carry 90 thousand. V. ON THE RESISTANCE OF BEAMS. 793. That angle will offer the greatest resistance which is most acute,\r\nand the most obtuse will be the weakest. [Footnote: The three smaller sketches accompany the text in the\r\noriginal, but the larger one is not directly connected with it. It\r\nis to be found on fol. 89a of the same Manuscript and there we read\r\nin a note, written underneath, _coverchio della perdicha del\r\ncastello_ (roof of the flagstaff of the castle),--Compare also Pl. XCIII, No. 1.]\r\n\r\n794. If the beams and the weight _o_ are 100 pounds, how much weight will\r\nbe wanted at _ae_ to resist such a weight, that it may not fall\r\ndown? 795. ON THE LENGTH OF BEAMS. That beam which is more than 20 times as long as its greatest\r\nthickness will be of brief duration and will break in half; and\r\nremember, that the part built into the wall should be steeped in hot\r\npitch and filleted with oak boards likewise so steeped. Each beam\r\nmust pass through its walls and be secured beyond the walls with\r\nsufficient chaining, because in consequence of earthquakes the beams\r\nare often seen to come out of the walls and bring down the walls and\r\nfloors; whilst if they are chained they will hold the walls strongly\r\ntogether and the walls will hold the floors. Again I remind you\r\nnever to put plaster over timber. Since by expansion and shrinking\r\nof the timber produced by damp and dryness such floors often crack,\r\nand once cracked their divisions gradually produce dust and an ugly\r\neffect. Again remember not to lay a floor on beams supported on\r\narches; for, in time the floor which is made on beams settles\r\nsomewhat in the middle while that part of the floor which rests on\r\nthe arches remains in its place; hence, floors laid over two kinds\r\nof supports look, in time, as if they were made in hills [Footnote:\r\n19 M. RAVAISSON, in his edition of MS.

A few remarks may here be added on the style of Leonardo's\r\narchitectural studies. However incomplete, however small in scale,\r\nthey allow us to establish a certain number of facts and\r\nprobabilities, well worthy of consideration. When Leonardo began his studies the great name of Brunellesco was\r\nstill the inspiration of all Florence, and we cannot doubt that\r\nLeonardo was open to it, since we find among his sketches the plan\r\nof the church of Santo Spirito[Footnote 1: See Pl. XCIV, No. 2. Then\r\nonly in course of erection after the designs of Brunellesco, though\r\nhe was already dead; finished in 1481.] and a lateral view of San\r\nLorenzo (Pl.

C.A. 309) proves that he also studied mediaeval\r\nmonuments.]\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the second period of modern Italian architecture\r\nfalls during the first twenty years of Leonardo's life. However the\r\nnew impetus given by Leon Battista Alberti either was not generally\r\nunderstood by his contemporaries, or those who appreciated it, had\r\nno opportunity of showing that they did so. It was only when taken\r\nup by Bramante and developed by him to the highest rank of modern\r\narchitecture that this new influence was generally felt. Now the\r\npeculiar feature of Leonardo's sketches is that, like the works of\r\nBramante, they appear to be the development and continuation of\r\nAlberti's. _But a question here occurs which is difficult to answer. Did\r\nLeonardo, till he quitted Florence, follow the direction given by\r\nthe dominant school of Brunellesco, which would then have given rise\r\nto his \"First manner\", or had he, even before he left Florence, felt\r\nAlberti's influence--either through his works (Palazzo Ruccellai,\r\nand the front of Santa Maria Novella) or through personal\r\nintercourse? Or was it not till he went to Milan that Alberti's work\r\nbegan to impress him through Bramante, who probably had known\r\nAlberti at Mantua about 1470 and who not only carried out Alberti's\r\nviews and ideas, but, by his designs for St. Peter's at Rome, proved\r\nhimself the greatest of modern architects. When Leonardo went to\r\nMilan Bramante had already been living there for many years. One of\r\nhis earliest works in Milan was the church of Santa Maria presso San\r\nSatiro, Via del Falcone[Footnote 1: Evidence of this I intend to\r\ngive later on in a Life of Bramante, which I have in preparation.]. Now we find among Leonardos studies of Cupolas on Plates LXXXIV and\r\nLXXXV and in Pl. LXXX several sketches which seem to me to have been\r\nsuggested by Bramante's dome of this church. The MSS. B and Ash. II contain the plans of S. Sepolcro, the\r\npavilion in the garden of the duke of Milan, and two churches,\r\nevidently inspired by the church of San Lorenzo at Milan. MS. B. contains besides two notes relating to Pavia, one of them a\r\ndesign for the sacristy of the Cathedral at Pavia, which cannot be\r\nsupposed to be dated later than 1492, and it has probably some\r\nrelation to Leonardo's call to Pavia June 21, 1490[Footnote 2: The\r\nsketch of the plan of Brunellesco's church of Santo Spirito at\r\nFlorence, which occurs in the same Manuscript, may have been done\r\nfrom memory.]. These and other considerations justify us in\r\nconcluding, that Leonardo made his studies of cupolas at Milan,\r\nprobably between the years 1487 and 1492 in anticipation of the\r\nerection of one of the grandest churches of Italy, the Cathedral of\r\nPavia. This may explain the decidedly Lombardo-Bramantesque tendency\r\nin the style of these studies, among which only a few remind us of\r\nthe forms of the cupolas of S. Maria del Fiore and of the Baptistery\r\nof Florence. Thus, although when compared with Bramante's work,\r\nseveral of these sketches plainly reveal that master's influence, we\r\nfind, among the sketches of domes, some, which show already\r\nBramante's classic style, of which the Tempietto of San Pietro in\r\nMontorio, his first building executed at Rome, is the foremost\r\nexample[Footnote 3: It may be mentioned here, that in 1494 Bramante\r\nmade a similar design for the lantern of the Cupola of the Church of\r\nSanta Maria delle Grazie.]. On Plate LXXXIV is a sketch of the plan of a similar circular\r\nbuilding; and the Mausoleum on Pl. XCVIII, no less than one of the\r\npedestals for the statue of Francesco Sforza (Pl. LXV), is of the\r\nsame type. The drawings Pl. LXXXIV No. 2, Pl.

XCI No. 2, with the interesting decoration by gigantic\r\nstatues in large niches, are also, I believe, more in the style\r\nBramante adopted at Rome, than in the Lombard style. Are we to\r\nconclude from this that Leonardo on his part influenced Bramante in\r\nthe sense of simplifying his style and rendering it more congenial\r\nto antique art? The answer to this important question seems at first\r\ndifficult to give, for we are here in presence of Bramante, the\r\ngreatest of modern architects, and with Leonardo, the man comparable\r\nwith no other. We have no knowledge of any buildings erected by\r\nLeonardo, and unless we admit personal intercourse--which seems\r\nprobable, but of which there is no proof--, it would be difficult to\r\nunderstand how Leonardo could have affected Bramante's style. The\r\nconverse is more easily to be admitted, since Bramante, as we have\r\nproved elsewhere, drew and built simultaneously in different\r\nmanners, and though in Lombardy there is no building by him in his\r\nclassic style, the use of brick for building, in that part of Italy,\r\nmay easily account for it._\r\n\r\n_Bramante's name is incidentally mentioned in Leonardo's manuscripts\r\nin two passages (Nos. 1414 and 1448). On each occasion it is only a\r\nslight passing allusion, and the nature of the context gives us no\r\ndue information as to any close connection between the two artists._\r\n\r\n_It might be supposed, on the ground of Leonardo's relations with\r\nthe East given in sections XVII and XXI of this volume, that some\r\nevidence of oriental influence might be detected in his\r\narchitectural drawings. I do not however think that any such traces\r\ncan be pointed out with certainty unless perhaps the drawing for a\r\nMausoleum, Pl. XC VIII._\r\n\r\n_Among several studies for the construction of cupolas above a Greek\r\ncross there are some in which the forms are decidedly monotonous. These, it is clear, were not designed as models of taste; they must\r\nbe regarded as the results of certain investigations into the laws\r\nof proportion, harmony and contrast._\r\n\r\n_The designs for churches, on the plan of a Latin cross are\r\nevidently intended to depart as little as possible from the form of\r\na Greek cross; and they also show a preference for a nave surrounded\r\nwith outer porticos._\r\n\r\n_The architectural forms preferred by Leonardo are pilasters coupled\r\n(Pl. LXXXII No. 1; or grouped (Pl. LXXX No. 5 and XCIV No. 4), often\r\ncombined with niches. We often meet with orders superposed, one in\r\neach story, or two small orders on one story, in combination with\r\none great order (Pl. XCVI No. 2)._\r\n\r\nThe drum (tamburo) of these cupolas is generally octagonal, as in\r\nthe cathedral of Florence, and with similar round windows in its\r\nsides. In Pl. LXXXVII No. 2 it is circular like the model actually\r\ncarried out by Michael Angelo at St. Peter's. The cupola itself is either hidden under a pyramidal roof, as in the\r\nBaptistery of Florence, San Lorenzo of Milan and most of the Lombard\r\nchurches (Pl. XCI No. 1 and Pl. XCII No. 1); but it more generally\r\nsuggests the curve of Sta Maria del Fiore (Pl. LXXXVIII No. 5; Pl. XC No. 2; Pl. LXXXIX, M; Pl XC No. 4, Pl. XCVI No. 2). In other\r\ncases (Pl. LXXX No. 4; Pl. LXXXIX; Pl. XC No. 2) it shows the sides\r\nof the octagon crowned by semicircular pediments, as in\r\nBrunellesco's lantern of the Cathedral and in the model for the\r\nCathedral of Pavia.

William Hunter, the great surgeon--a competent judge--who had an\r\nopportunity in the time of George III. of seeing the originals in\r\nthe King's Library, has thus recorded his opinion: \"I expected to\r\nsee little more than such designs in Anatomy as might be useful to a\r\npainter in his own profession. But I saw, and indeed with\r\nastonishment, that Leonardo had been a general and deep student. When I consider what pains he has taken upon every part of the body,\r\nthe superiority of his universal genius, his particular excellence\r\nin mechanics and hydraulics, and the attention with which such a man\r\nwould examine and see objects which he has to draw, I am fully\r\npersuaded that Leonardo was the best Anatomist, at that time, in the\r\nworld ... Leonardo was certainly the first man, we know of, who\r\nintroduced the practice of making anatomical drawings\" (Two\r\nintroductory letters. London 1784, pages 37 and 39). The illustrious German Naturalist Johan Friedrich Blumenback\r\nesteemed them no less highly; he was one of the privileged few who,\r\nafter Hunter, had the chance of seeing these Manuscripts. He writes:\r\n_Der Scharfblick dieses grossen Forschers und Darstellers der Natur\r\nhat schon auf Dinge geachtet, die noch Jahrhunderte nachher\r\nunbemerkt geblieben sind_\" (see _Blumenbach's medicinische\r\nBibliothek_, Vol. 3, St. 4, 1795. page 728). These opinions were founded on the drawings alone. Up to the present\r\nday hardly anything has been made known of the text, and, for the\r\nreasons I have given, it is my intention to reproduce here no more\r\nthan a selection of extracts which I have made from the originals at\r\nWindsor Castle and elsewhere. In the Bibliography of the\r\nManuscripts, at the end of this volume a short review is given of\r\nthe valuable contents of these Anatomical note books which are at\r\npresent almost all in the possession of her Majesty the Queen of\r\nEngland. It is, I believe, possible to assign the date with\r\napproximate accuracy to almost all the fragments, and I am thus led\r\nto conclude that the greater part of Leonardo's anatomical\r\ninvestigations were carried out after the death of della Torre. Merely in reading the introductory notes to his various books on\r\nAnatomy which are here printed it is impossible to resist the\r\nimpression that the Master's anatomical studies bear to a very great\r\nextent the stamp of originality and independent thought.

In the\r\npassage under consideration, which was evidently written at a late\r\nperiod of his life, Leonardo speaks of his Manuscript note-books as\r\nnumbering 12O; but we should hardly be justified in concluding from\r\nthis passage that the greater part of his Manuscripts were now\r\nmissing (see _Prolegomena_, Vol. I, pp. 5-7).], the hundred and\r\ntwenty books composed by me will give verdict Yes or No. In these I\r\nhave been hindered neither by avarice nor negligence, but simply by\r\nwant of time.

This depicting of mine of the human body will be as clear to you as\r\nif you had the natural man before you; and the reason is that if you\r\nwish thoroughly to know the parts of man, anatomically, you--or your\r\neye--require to see it from different aspects, considering it from\r\nbelow and from above and from its sides, turning it about and\r\nseeking the origin of each member; and in this way the natural\r\nanatomy is sufficient for your comprehension. But you must\r\nunderstand that this amount of knowledge will not continue to\r\nsatisfy you; seeing the very great confusion that must result from\r\nthe combination of tissues, with veins, arteries, nerves, sinews,\r\nmuscles, bones, and blood which, of itself, tinges every part the\r\nsame colour. And the veins, which discharge this blood, are not\r\ndiscerned by reason of their smallness. Moreover integrity of the\r\ntissues, in the process of the investigating the parts within them,\r\nis inevitably destroyed, and their transparent substance being\r\ntinged with blood does not allow you to recognise the parts covered\r\nby them, from the similarity of their blood-stained hue; and you\r\ncannot know everything of the one without confusing and destroying\r\nthe other. Hence, some further anatomy drawings become necessary. Of\r\nwhich you want three to give full knowledge of the veins and\r\narteries, everything else being destroyed with the greatest care. And three others to display the tissues; and three for the sinews\r\nand muscles and ligaments; and three for the bones and cartilages;\r\nand three for the anatomy of the bones, which have to be sawn to\r\nshow which are hollow and which are not, which have marrow and which\r\nare spongy, and which are thick from the outside inwards, and which\r\nare thin.", "sentences": ["Then I will describe which are the members, which, after the boy is\r\nborn, grow more than the others, and determine the proportions of a\r\nboy of one year.", "Then describe the fully grown man and woman, with their proportions,\r\nand the nature of their complexions, colour, and physiognomy.", "Then how they are composed of veins, tendons, muscles and bones.", "This I shall do at the end of the book.", "Then, in four drawings,\r\nrepresent four universal conditions of men.", "That is, Mirth, with\r\nvarious acts of laughter, and describe the cause of laughter.", "Weeping in various aspects with its causes.", "Contention, with various\r\nacts of killing; flight, fear, ferocity, boldness, murder and every\r\nthing pertaining to such cases.", "Then represent Labour, with pulling,\r\nthrusting, carrying, stopping, supporting and such like things.", "Further I would describe attitudes and movements.", "Then perspective,\r\nconcerning the functions and effects of the eye; and of\r\nhearing--here I will speak of music--, and treat of the other\r\nsenses.", "And then describe the nature of the senses.", "This mechanism of man we will demonstrate in ...", "figures; of which\r\nthe three first will show the ramification of the bones; that is:\r\nfirst one to show their height and position and shape: the second\r\nwill be seen in profile and will show the depth of the whole and of\r\nthe parts, and their position.", "The third figure will be a\r\ndemonstration of the bones of the backparts.", "Then I will make three\r\nother figures from the same point of view, with the bones sawn\r\nacross, in which will be shown their thickness and hollowness.", "Three\r\nother figures of the bones complete, and of the nerves which rise\r\nfrom the nape of the neck, and in what limbs they ramify.", "And three\r\nothers of the bones and veins, and where they ramify.", "Then three\r\nfigures with the muscles and three with the skin, and their proper\r\nproportions; and three of woman, to illustrate the womb and the\r\nmenstrual veins which go to the breasts.", "[Footnote: The meaning of the word _nervo_ varies in different\r\npassages, being sometimes used for _muscolo_ (muscle).]\r\n\r\n798.", "THE ORDER OF THE BOOK.", "This depicting of mine of the human body will be as clear to you as\r\nif you had the natural man before you; and the reason is that if you\r\nwish thoroughly to know the parts of man, anatomically, you--or your\r\neye--require to see it from different aspects, considering it from\r\nbelow and from above and from its sides, turning it about and\r\nseeking the origin of each member; and in this way the natural\r\nanatomy is sufficient for your comprehension.", "But you must\r\nunderstand that this amount of knowledge will not continue to\r\nsatisfy you; seeing the very great confusion that must result from\r\nthe combination of tissues, with veins, arteries, nerves, sinews,\r\nmuscles, bones, and blood which, of itself, tinges every part the\r\nsame colour.", "And the veins, which discharge this blood, are not\r\ndiscerned by reason of their smallness.", "Moreover integrity of the\r\ntissues, in the process of the investigating the parts within them,\r\nis inevitably destroyed, and their transparent substance being\r\ntinged with blood does not allow you to recognise the parts covered\r\nby them, from the similarity of their blood-stained hue; and you\r\ncannot know everything of the one without confusing and destroying\r\nthe other.", "Hence, some further anatomy drawings become necessary.", "Of\r\nwhich you want three to give full knowledge of the veins and\r\narteries, everything else being destroyed with the greatest care.", "And three others to display the tissues; and three for the sinews\r\nand muscles and ligaments; and three for the bones and cartilages;\r\nand three for the anatomy of the bones, which have to be sawn to\r\nshow which are hollow and which are not, which have marrow and which\r\nare spongy, and which are thick from the outside inwards, and which\r\nare thin."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_199", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 199)", "language": "it", "content": "And some are extremely thin in some parts and thick in\r\nothers, and in some parts hollow or filled up with bone, or full of\r\nmarrow, or spongy.

And three you\r\nmust have for the woman, in which there is much that is mysterious\r\nby reason of the womb and the foetus. Therefore by my drawings every\r\npart will be known to you, and all by means of demonstrations from\r\nthree different points of view of each part; for when you have seen\r\na limb from the front, with any muscles, sinews, or veins which take\r\ntheir rise from the opposite side, the same limb will be shown to\r\nyou in a side view or from behind, exactly as if you had that same\r\nlimb in your hand and were turning it from side to side until you\r\nhad acquired a full comprehension of all you wished to know.

CVII. The original drawing at\r\nWindsor is 28 1/2 X 19 1/2 centimetres. The upper figures are\r\nslightly washed with Indian ink. On the back of this drawing is the\r\ntext No. 1140.]. Thus, in twelve entire figures, you will have set before you the\r\ncosmography of this lesser world on the same plan as, before me, was\r\nadopted by Ptolemy in his cosmography; and so I will afterwards\r\ndivide them into limbs as he divided the whole world into provinces;\r\nthen I will speak of the function of each part in every direction,\r\nputting before your eyes a description of the whole form and\r\nsubstance of man, as regards his movements from place to place, by\r\nmeans of his different parts. And thus, if it please our great\r\nAuthor, I may demonstrate the nature of men, and their customs in\r\nthe way I describe his figure. And remember that the anatomy of the nerves will not give the\r\nposition of their ramifications, nor show you which muscles they\r\nbranch into, by means of bodies dissected in running water or in\r\nlime water; though indeed their origin and starting point may be\r\nseen without such water as well as with it. But their ramifications,\r\nwhen under running water, cling and unite--just like flat or hemp\r\ncarded for spinning--all into a skein, in a way which makes it\r\nimpossible to trace in which muscles or by what ramification the\r\nnerves are distributed among those muscles. 799. THE ARRANGEMENT OF ANATOMY\r\n\r\nFirst draw the bones, let us say, of the arm, and put in the motor\r\nmuscle from the shoulder to the elbow with all its lines. Then\r\nproceed in the same way from the elbow to the wrist. Then from the\r\nwrist to the hand and from the hand to the fingers. And in the arm you will put the motors of the fingers which open,\r\nand these you will show separately in their demonstration. In the\r\nsecond demonstration you will clothe these muscles with the\r\nsecondary motors of the fingers and so proceed by degrees to avoid\r\nconfusion. But first lay on the bones those muscles which lie close\r\nto the said bones, without confusion of other muscles; and with\r\nthese you may put the nerves and veins which supply their\r\nnourishment, after having first drawn the tree of veins and nerves\r\nover the simple bones. 800. Begin the anatomy at the head and finish at the sole of the foot. 801. 3 men complete, 3 with bones and nerves, 3 with the bones only. Here\r\nwe have 12 demonstrations of entire figures. 802. When you have finished building up the man, you will make the statue\r\nwith all its superficial measurements. [Footnote: _Cresciere l'omo_. The meaning of this expression appears\r\nto be different here and in the passage C.A. 157a, 468a (see No. 526, Note 1. 2).

You must show all the motions of the bones with their joints to\r\nfollow the demonstration of the first three figures of the bones,\r\nand this should be done in the first book. 804. Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle,\r\nyou must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way\r\nas to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the\r\nligaments of the bones. NOTE. You will never get any thing but confusion in demonstrating the\r\nmuscles and their positions, origin, and termination, unless you\r\nfirst make a demonstration of thin muscles after the manner of linen\r\nthreads; and thus you can represent them, one over another as nature\r\nhas placed them; and thus, too, you can name them according to the\r\nlimb they serve; for instance the motor of the point of the great\r\ntoe, of its middle bone, of its first bone, &c. And when you have\r\nthe knowledge you will draw, by the side of this, the true form and\r\nsize and position of each muscle. But remember to give the threads\r\nwhich explain the situation of the muscles in the position which\r\ncorresponds to the central line of each muscle; and so these threads\r\nwill demonstrate the form of the leg and their distance in a plain\r\nand clear manner. I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that\r\nthe muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin\r\nmembrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in\r\nmuscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by\r\nthe skin they had very little over their natural size.

Thus it is composed of less ingenious instruments, and of\r\nspaces less capacious for receiving the faculties of sense. I have\r\nseen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with\r\npart of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils,\r\nwhich form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which\r\nenters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several\r\npassages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down. The eyes in the Lion tribe have a large part of the head for their\r\nsockets and the optic nerves communicate at once with the brain; but\r\nthe contrary is to be seen in man, for the sockets of the eyes are\r\nbut a small part of the head, and the optic nerves are very fine and\r\nlong and weak, and by the weakness of their action we see by day but\r\nbadly at night, while these animals can see as well at night as by\r\nday. The proof that they can see is that they prowl for prey at\r\nnight and sleep by day, as nocturnal birds do also. Advantages in the structure of the eye in certain animals (828-831). 828. Every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\r\nand larger in the morning than at midday. This happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\r\nthan at any other time. In proportion as the eye or the pupil of the owl is larger in\r\nproportion to the animal than that of man, so much the more light\r\ncan it see at night than man can; hence at midday it can see nothing\r\nif its pupil does not diminish; and, in the same way, at night\r\nthings look larger to it than by day. 829. OF THE EYES IN ANIMALS. The eyes of all animals have their pupils adapted to dilate and\r\ndiminish of their own accord in proportion to the greater or less\r\nlight of the sun or other luminary. But in birds the variation is\r\nmuch greater; and particularly in nocturnal birds, such as horned\r\nowls, and in the eyes of one species of owl; in these the pupil\r\ndilates in such away as to occupy nearly the whole eye, or\r\ndiminishes to the size of a grain of millet, and always preserves\r\nthe circular form. But in the Lion tribe, as panthers, pards,\r\nounces, tigers, lynxes, Spanish cats and other similar animals the\r\npupil diminishes from the perfect circle to the figure of a pointed\r\noval such as is shown in the margin. But man having a weaker sight\r\nthan any other animal is less hurt by a very strong light and his\r\npupil increases but little in dark places; but in the eyes of these\r\nnocturnal animals, the horned owl--a bird which is the largest of\r\nall nocturnal birds--the power of vision increases so much that in\r\nthe faintest nocturnal light (which we call darkness) it sees with\r\nmuch more distinctness than we do in the splendour of noon day, at\r\nwhich time these birds remain hidden in dark holes; or if indeed\r\nthey are compelled to come out into the open air lighted up by the\r\nsun, they contract their pupils so much that their power of sight\r\ndiminishes together with the quantity of light admitted. Study the anatomy of various eyes and see which are the muscles\r\nwhich open and close the said pupils of the eyes of animals.

On the conditions of sight (834. 835). 834. OF THE NATURE OF SIGHT. I say that sight is exercised by all animals, by the medium of\r\nlight; and if any one adduces, as against this, the sight of\r\nnocturnal animals, I must say that this in the same way is subject\r\nto the very same natural laws. For it will easily be understood that\r\nthe senses which receive the images of things do not project from\r\nthemselves any visual virtue [Footnote 4: Compare No. 68.]. On the\r\ncontrary the atmospheric medium which exists between the object and\r\nthe sense incorporates in itself the figure of things, and by its\r\ncontact with the sense transmits the object to it. If the\r\nobject--whether by sound or by odour--presents its spiritual force\r\nto the ear or the nose, then light is not required and does not act. The forms of objects do not send their images into the air if they\r\nare not illuminated [8]; and the eye being thus constituted cannot\r\nreceive that from the air, which the air does not possess, although\r\nit touches its surface. If you choose to say that there are many\r\nanimals that prey at night, I answer that when the little light\r\nwhich suffices the nature of their eyes is wanting, they direct\r\nthemselves by their strong sense of hearing and of smell, which are\r\nnot impeded by the darkness, and in which they are very far superior\r\nto man. If you make a cat leap, by daylight, among a quantity of\r\njars and crocks you will see them remain unbroken, but if you do the\r\nsame at night, many will be broken. Night birds do not fly about\r\nunless the moon shines full or in part; rather do they feed between\r\nsun-down and the total darkness of the night. [Footnote 8: See No. 58-67.]\r\n\r\nNo body can be apprehended without light and shade, and light and\r\nshade are caused by light. 835.

The seat of the common sense. 836. The Common Sense, is that which judges of things offered to it by\r\nthe other senses. The ancient speculators have concluded that that\r\npart of man which constitutes his judgment is caused by a central\r\norgan to which the other five senses refer everything by means of\r\nimpressibility; and to this centre they have given the name Common\r\nSense. And they say that this Sense is situated in the centre of the\r\nhead between Sensation and Memory. And this name of Common Sense is\r\ngiven to it solely because it is the common judge of all the other\r\nfive senses _i.e._ Seeing, Hearing, Touch, Taste and Smell. This\r\nCommon Sense is acted upon by means of Sensation which is placed as\r\na medium between it and the senses. Sensation is acted upon by means\r\nof the images of things presented to it by the external instruments,\r\nthat is to say the senses which are the medium between external\r\nthings and Sensation. In the same way the senses are acted upon by\r\nobjects. Surrounding things transmit their images to the senses and\r\nthe senses transfer them to the Sensation. Sensation sends them to\r\nthe Common Sense, and by it they are stamped upon the memory and are\r\nthere more or less retained according to the importance or force of\r\nthe impression. That sense is most rapid in its function which is\r\nnearest to the sensitive medium and the eye, being the highest is\r\nthe chief of the others. Of this then only we will speak, and the\r\nothers we will leave in order not to make our matter too long. Experience tells us that the eye apprehends ten different natures of\r\nthings, that is: Light and Darkness, one being the cause of the\r\nperception of the nine others, and the other its absence:-- Colour\r\nand substance, form and place, distance and nearness, motion and\r\nstillness [Footnote 15: Compare No. 23.]. On the origin of the soul. 837. Though human ingenuity may make various inventions which, by the\r\nhelp of various machines answering the same end, it will never\r\ndevise any inventions more beautiful, nor more simple, nor more to\r\nthe purpose than Nature does; because in her inventions nothing is\r\nwanting, and nothing is superfluous, and she needs no counterpoise\r\nwhen she makes limbs proper for motion in the bodies of animals. But\r\nshe puts into them the soul of the body, which forms them that is\r\nthe soul of the mother which first constructs in the womb the form\r\nof the man and in due time awakens the soul that is to inhabit it. And this at first lies dormant and under the tutelage of the soul of\r\nthe mother, who nourishes and vivifies it by the umbilical vein,\r\nwith all its spiritual parts, and this happens because this\r\numbilicus is joined to the placenta and the cotyledons, by which the\r\nchild is attached to the mother. And these are the reason why a\r\nwish, a strong craving or a fright or any other mental suffering in\r\nthe mother, has more influence on the child than on the mother; for\r\nthere are many cases when the child loses its life from them, &c. This discourse is not in its place here, but will be wanted for the\r\none on the composition of animated bodies--and the rest of the\r\ndefinition of the soul I leave to the imaginations of friars, those\r\nfathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration.

Rather is it entirely in one part. Because, if it were all-pervading and the same in every part, there\r\nwould have been no need to make the instruments of the senses meet\r\nin one centre and in one single spot; on the contrary it would have\r\nsufficed that the eye should fulfil the function of its sensation on\r\nits surface only, and not transmit the image of the things seen, to\r\nthe sense, by means of the optic nerves, so that the soul--for the\r\nreason given above-- may perceive it in the surface of the eye. In\r\nthe same way as to the sense of hearing, it would have sufficed if\r\nthe voice had merely sounded in the porous cavity of the indurated\r\nportion of the temporal bone which lies within the ear, without\r\nmaking any farther transit from this bone to the common sense, where\r\nthe voice confers with and discourses to the common judgment.

Our life is made by the death of others. In dead matter insensible life remains, which, reunited to the\r\nstomachs of living beings, resumes life, both sensual and\r\nintellectual. 846.

On the circulation of the blood (848-850). 848. Death in old men, when not from fever, is caused by the veins which\r\ngo from the spleen to the valve of the liver, and which thicken so\r\nmuch in the walls that they become closed up and leave no passage\r\nfor the blood that nourishes it. [6]The incessant current of the blood through the veins makes these\r\nveins thicken and become callous, so that at last they close up and\r\nprevent the passage of the blood. 849. The waters return with constant motion from the lowest depths of the\r\nsea to the utmost height of the mountains, not obeying the nature of\r\nheavier bodies; and in this they resemble the blood of animated\r\nbeings which always moves from the sea of the heart and flows\r\ntowards the top of the head; and here it may burst a vein, as may be\r\nseen when a vein bursts in the nose; all the blood rises from below\r\nto the level of the burst vein. When the water rushes out from the\r\nburst vein in the earth, it obeys the law of other bodies that are\r\nheavier than the air since it always seeks low places. [Footnote: From this passage it is quite plain that Leonardo had not\r\nmerely a general suspicion of the circulation of the blood but a\r\nvery clear conception of it. Leonardo's studies on the muscles of\r\nthe heart are to be found in the MS. W. An. III. but no information\r\nabout them has hitherto been made public.

WILLIAM\r\nHARVEY (born 1578 and Professor of Anatomy at Cambridge from 1615)\r\nis always considered to have been the discoverer of the circulation\r\nof the blood.

In the passages here printed, a connected view is given of\r\nhis astronomical studies as they lie scattered through the\r\nmanuscripts, which have come down to us. Unlike his other purely\r\nscientific labours, Leonardo devotes here a good deal of attention\r\nto the opinions of the ancients, though he does not follow the\r\npractice universal in his day of relying on them as authorities; he\r\nonly quotes them, as we shall see, in order to refute their\r\narguments. His researches throughout have the stamp of independent\r\nthought. There is nothing in these writings to lead us to suppose\r\nthat they were merely an epitome of the general learning common to\r\nthe astronomers of the period. As early as in the XIVth century\r\nthere were chairs of astronomy in the universities of Padua and\r\nBologna, but so late as during the entire XVIth century Astronomy\r\nand Astrology were still closely allied._\r\n\r\n_It is impossible now to decide whether Leonardo, when living in\r\nFlorence, became acquainted in his youth with the doctrines of Paolo\r\nToscanelli the great astronomer and mathematician (died_ 1482_), of\r\nwhose influence and teaching but little is now known, beyond the\r\nfact that he advised and encouraged Columbus to carry out his\r\nproject of sailing round the world. His name is nowhere mentioned by\r\nLeonardo, and from the dates of the manuscripts from which the texts\r\non astronomy are taken, it seems highly probable that Leonardo\r\ndevoted his attention to astronomical studies less in his youth than\r\nin his later years. It was evidently his purpose to treat of\r\nAstronomy in a connected form and in a separate work (see the\r\nbeginning of Nos._ 866 _and_ 892_; compare also No._ 1167_). It is\r\nquite in accordance with his general scientific thoroughness that he\r\nshould propose to write a special treatise on Optics as an\r\nintroduction to Astronomy (see Nos._ 867 _and_ 877_).

The fundamental laws of the solar system (859-864). 859. Force arises from dearth or abundance; it is the child of physical\r\nmotion, and the grand-child of spiritual motion, and the mother and\r\norigin of gravity. Gravity is limited to the elements of water and\r\nearth; but this force is unlimited, and by it infinite worlds might\r\nbe moved if instruments could be made by which the force could be\r\ngenerated. Force, with physical motion, and gravity, with resistance are the\r\nfour external powers on which all actions of mortals depend. Force has its origin in spiritual motion; and this motion, flowing\r\nthrough the limbs of sentient animals, enlarges their muscles. Being\r\nenlarged by this current the muscles are shrunk in length and\r\ncontract the tendons which are connected with them, and this is the\r\ncause of the force of the limbs in man. The quality and quantity of the force of a man are able to give\r\nbirth to other forces, which will be proportionally greater as the\r\nmotions produced by them last longer. [Footnote: Only part of this passage belongs, strictly speaking, to\r\nthis section. The principle laid down in the second paragraph is\r\nmore directly connected with the notes given in the preceding\r\nsection on Physiology.]\r\n\r\n860. Why does not the weight _o_ remain in its place? It does not remain\r\nbecause it has no resistance. Where will it move to? It will move\r\ntowards the centre [of gravity]. And why by no other line?

In your discourse you must prove that the earth is a star much like\r\nthe moon, and the glory of our universe; and then you must treat of\r\nthe size of various stars, according to the authors. 867. THE METHOD OF PROVING THAT THE EARTH IS A STAR. First describe the eye; then show how the twinkling of a star is\r\nreally in the eye and why one star should twinkle more than another,\r\nand how the rays from the stars originate in the eye; and add, that\r\nif the twinkling of the stars were really in the stars --as it seems\r\nto be--that this twinkling appears to be an extension as great as\r\nthe diameter of the body of the star; therefore, the star being\r\nlarger than the earth, this motion effected in an instant would be a\r\nrapid doubling of the size of the star. Then prove that the surface\r\nof the air where it lies contiguous to fire, and the surface of the\r\nfire where it ends are those into which the solar rays penetrate,\r\nand transmit the images of the heavenly bodies, large when they\r\nrise, and small, when they are on the meridian. Let _a_ be the earth\r\nand _n d m_ the surface of the air in contact with the sphere of\r\nfire; _h f g_ is the orbit of the moon or, if you please, of the\r\nsun; then I say that when the sun appears on the horizon _g_, its\r\nrays are seen passing through the surface of the air at a slanting\r\nangle, that is _o m_; this is not the case at _d k_. And so it\r\npasses through a greater mass of air; all of _e m_ is a denser\r\natmosphere. 868. Beyond the sun and us there is darkness and so the air appears blue.

Among objects moved from the eye at equal distance, that undergoes\r\nleast diminution which at first was most remote. When various objects are removed at equal distances farther from\r\ntheir original position, that which was at first the farthest from\r\nthe eye will diminish least. And the proportion of the diminution\r\nwill be in proportion to the relative distance of the objects from\r\nthe eye before they were removed. That is to say in the object _t_ and the object _e_ the proportion\r\nof their distances from the eye _a_ is quintuple. I remove each from\r\nits place and set it farther from the eye by one of the 5 parts into\r\nwhich the proposition is divided. Hence it happens that the nearest\r\nto the eye has doubled the distance and according to the last\r\nproposition but one of this, is diminished by the half of its whole\r\nsize; and the body _e_, by the same motion, is diminished 1/5 of its\r\nwhole size. Therefore, by that same last proposition but one, that\r\nwhich is said in this last proposition is true; and this I say of\r\nthe motions of the celestial bodies which are more distant by 3500\r\nmiles when setting than when overhead, and yet do not increase or\r\ndiminish in any sensible degree. 871. _a b_ is the aperture through which the sun passes, and if you could\r\nmeasure the size of the solar rays at _n m_, you could accurately\r\ntrace the real lines of the convergence of the solar rays, the\r\nmirror being at _a b_, and then show the reflected rays at equal\r\nangles to _n m_; but, as you want to have them at _n m_, take them\r\nat the. inner side of the aperture at cd, where they maybe measured\r\nat the spot where the solar rays fall. Then place your mirror at the\r\ndistance _a b_, making the rays _d b_, _c a_ fall and then be\r\nreflected at equal angles towards _c d_; and this is the best\r\nmethod, but you must use this mirror always in the same month, and\r\nthe same day, and hour and instant, and this will be better than at\r\nno fixed time because when the sun is at a certain distance it\r\nproduces a certain pyramid of rays. 872.", "sentences": ["The\r\nconvex pupil of the eye can take in the whole of our hemisphere,\r\nwhile this will show only a single star;

THE REASON OF THE INCREASED SIZE OF THE SUN IN THE WEST. Some mathematicians explain that the sun looks larger as it sets,\r\nbecause the eye always sees it through a denser atmosphere, alleging\r\nthat objects seen through mist or through water appear larger. To\r\nthese I reply: No; because objects seen through a mist are similar\r\nin colour to those at a distance; but not being similarly diminished\r\nthey appear larger. Again, nothing increases in size in smooth\r\nwater; and the proof of this may be seen by throwing a light on a\r\nboard placed half under water. But the reason why the sun looks\r\nlarger is that every luminous body appears larger in proportion as\r\nit is more remote. [Footnote: Lines 5 and 6 are thus rendered by M. RAVAISSON in his edition of MS. A. \"_De meme, aucune chose ne croit\r\ndans l'eau plane, et tu en feras l'experience_ en calquant un ais\r\nsous l'eau.\"--Compare the diagrams in Vol. I, p. 114.]\r\n\r\nOn the luminosity of the Earth in the universal space (874-878). 874. In my book I propose to show, how the ocean and the other seas must,\r\nby means of the sun, make our world shine with the appearance of a\r\nmoon, and to the remoter worlds it looks like a star; and this I\r\nshall prove. Show, first that every light at a distance from the eye throws out\r\nrays which appear to increase the size of the luminous body; and\r\nfrom this it follows that 2 ...[Footnote 10: Here the text breaks\r\noff; lines 11 and fol. are written in the margin.]. [11]The moon is cold and moist. Water is cold and moist. Thus our\r\nseas must appear to the moon as the moon does to us. 875. The waves in water magnify the image of an object reflected in it. Let _a_ be the sun, and _n m_ the ruffled water, _b_ the image of\r\nthe sun when the water is smooth. Let _f_ be the eye which sees the\r\nimage in all the waves included within the base of the triangle _c e\r\nf_. Now the sun reflected in the unruffled surface occupied the\r\nspace _c d_, while in the ruffled surface it covers all the watery\r\nspace _c e_ (as is proved in the 4th of my \"Perspective\") [Footnote\r\n9: _Nel quarto della mia prospettiva_. If this reference is to the\r\ndiagrams accompanying the text--as is usual with Leonardo--and not\r\nto some particular work, the largest of the diagrams here given must\r\nbe meant. It is the lowest and actually the fifth, but he would have\r\ncalled it the fourth, for the text here given is preceded on the\r\nsame page of the manuscript by a passage on whirlpools, with the\r\ndiagram belonging to it also reproduced here. The words _della mia\r\nprospettiva_ may therefore indicate that the diagram to the\r\npreceding chapter treating on a heterogeneal subject is to be\r\nexcluded. It is a further difficulty that this diagram belongs\r\nproperly to lines 9-10 and not to the preceding sentence. The\r\nreflection of the sun in water is also discussed in the Theoretical\r\npart of the Book on Painting; see Vol. I, No. 206, 207.] and it will\r\ncover more of the water in proportion as the reflected image is\r\nremote from the eye [10].

[Footnote: In the original the writing is across the diagram.]\r\n\r\n882. Epicurus says the sun is the size it looks. Hence as it looks about\r\na foot across we must consider that to be its size; it would follow\r\nthat when the moon eclipses the sun, the sun ought not to appear the\r\nlarger, as it does. Then, the moon being smaller than the sun, the\r\nmoon must be less than a foot, and consequently when our world\r\neclipses the moon, it must be less than a foot by a finger's\r\nbreadth; inasmuch as if the sun is a foot across, and our earth\r\ncasts a conical shadow on the moon, it is inevitable that the\r\nluminous cause of the cone of shadow must be larger than the opaque\r\nbody which casts the cone of shadow. 883. To measure how many times the diameter of the sun will go into its\r\ncourse in 24 hours. Make a circle and place it to face the south, after the manner of a\r\nsundial, and place a rod in the middle in such a way as that its\r\nlength points to the centre of this circle, and mark the shadow cast\r\nin the sunshine by this rod on the circumference of the circle, and\r\nthis shadow will be--let us say-- as broad as from _a_ to _n_. Now\r\nmeasure how many times this shadow will go into this circumference\r\nof a circle, and that will give you the number of times that the\r\nsolar body will go into its orbit in 24 hours. Thus you may see\r\nwhether Epicurus was [right in] saying that the sun was only as\r\nlarge as it looked; for, as the apparent diameter of the sun is\r\nabout a foot, and as that sun would go a thousand times into the\r\nlength of its course in 24 hours, it would have gone a thousand\r\nfeet, that is 300 braccia, which is the sixth of a mile. Whence it\r\nwould follow that the course of the sun during the day would be the\r\nsixth part of a mile and that this venerable snail, the sun will\r\nhave travelled 25 braccia an hour. 884.

and these often combine at a long distance and\r\nappear as one. The lustre of the new moon is brighter and stronger,\r\nthan when the moon is full; and the reason of this is that the angle\r\nof incidence is more obtuse in the new than in the full moon, in\r\nwhich the angles [of incidence and reflection] are highly acute. The\r\nwaves of the moon therefore mirror the sun in the hollows of the\r\nwaves as well as on the ridges, and the sides remain in shadow. But\r\nat the sides of the moon the hollows of the waves do not catch the\r\nsunlight, but only their crests; and thus the images are fewer and\r\nmore mixed up with the shadows in the hollows; and this\r\nintermingling of the shaded and illuminated spots comes to the eye\r\nwith a mitigated splendour, so that the edges will be darker,\r\nbecause the curves of the sides of the waves are insufficient to\r\nreflect to the eye the rays that fall upon them. Now the new moon\r\nnaturally reflects the solar rays more directly towards the eye from\r\nthe crests of the waves than from any other part, as is shown by the\r\nform of the moon, whose rays a strike the waves _b_ and are\r\nreflected in the line _b d_, the eye being situated at _d_. This\r\ncannot happen at the full moon, when the solar rays, being in the\r\nwest, fall on the extreme waters of the moon to the East from _n_ to\r\n_m_, and are not reflected to the eye in the West, but are thrown\r\nback eastwards, with but slight deflection from the straight course\r\nof the solar ray; and thus the angle of incidence is very wide\r\nindeed. The moon is an opaque and solid body and if, on the contrary, it\r\nwere transparent, it would not receive the light of the sun. The yellow or yolk of an egg remains in the middle of the albumen,\r\nwithout moving on either side; now it is either lighter or heavier\r\nthan this albumen, or equal to it; if it is lighter, it ought to\r\nrise above all the albumen and stop in contact with the shell of the\r\negg; and if it is heavier, it ought to sink, and if it is equal, it\r\nmight just as well be at one of the ends, as in the middle or below\r\n[54]. [Footnote 48-64: Compare No. 861.]\r\n\r\nThe innumerable images of the solar rays reflected from the\r\ninnumerable waves of the sea, as they fall upon those waves, are\r\nwhat cause us to see the very broad and continuous radiance on the\r\nsurface of the sea. 897. That the sun could not be mirrored in the body of the moon, which is\r\na convex mirror, in such a way as that so much of its surface as is\r\nilluminated by the sun, should reflect the sun unless the moon had a\r\nsurface adapted to reflect it--in waves and ridges, like the surface\r\nof the sea when its surface is moved by the wind. [Footnote: In the original diagrams _sole_ is written at the place\r\nmarked _A; luna_ at _C,_ and _terra_ at the two spots marked _B_.]\r\n\r\nThe waves in water multiply the image of the object reflected in it.

And if you could stand where the moon is, the sun would look to you,\r\nas if it were reflected from all the sea that it illuminates by day;\r\nand the land amid the water would appear just like the dark spots\r\nthat are on the moon, which, when looked at from our earth, appears\r\nto men the same as our earth would appear to any men who might dwell\r\nin the moon.

Therefore it is not totally dark, and hence some have believed that\r\nthe moon must in parts have a light of its own besides that which is\r\ngiven it by the sun; and this light is due, as has been said, to the\r\nabove- mentioned cause,--that our seas are illuminated by the sun.

And the small amount of light which the dark side of the moon\r\nreceives bears the same proportion to the light of that side which\r\nis illuminated, as that...

But, if\r\nthis were the case, these spots would never be permanent, either as\r\nto position or form; and, seeing the moon from various aspects, even\r\nif these spots did not move they would change in form, as objects do\r\nwhich are seen from different sides. 904. OF THE SPOTS ON THE MOON. Others say that the moon is composed of more or less transparent\r\nparts; as though one part were something like alabaster and others\r\nlike crystal or glass. It would follow from this that the sun\r\ncasting its rays on the less transparent portions, the light would\r\nremain on the surface, and so the denser part would be illuminated,\r\nand the transparent portions would display the shadow of their\r\ndarker depths; and this is their account of the structure and nature\r\nof the moon.", "sentences": ["At _C luna_ (moon) is written and at _B terra_ (the earth).]\r\n\r\nSome might say that the air surrounding the moon as an element,\r\ncatches the light of the sun as our atmosphere does, and that it is\r\nthis which completes the luminous circle on the body of the moon.", "Some have thought that the moon has a light of its own, but this\r\nopinion is false, because they have founded it on that dim light\r\nseen between the hornes of the new moon, which looks dark where it\r\nis close to the bright part, while against the darkness of the\r\nbackground it looks so light that many have taken it to be a ring of\r\nnew radiance completing the circle where the tips of the horns\r\nilluminated by the sun cease to shine [Footnote 34: See Pl.", "CVIII,\r\nNo.", "5.].", "And this difference of background arises from the fact that\r\nthe portion of that background which is conterminous with the bright\r\npart of the moon, by comparison with that brightness looks darker\r\nthan it is; while at the upper part, where a portion of the luminous\r\ncircle is to be seen of uniform width, the result is that the moon,\r\nbeing brighter there than the medium or background on which it is\r\nseen by comparison with that darkness it looks more luminous at that\r\nedge than it is.", "And that brightness at such a time itself is\r\nderived from our ocean and other inland-seas.", "These are, at that\r\ntime, illuminated by the sun which is already setting in such a way\r\nas that the sea then fulfils the same function to the dark side of\r\nthe moon as the moon at its fifteenth day does to us when the sun is\r\nset.", "And the small amount of light which the dark side of the moon\r\nreceives bears the same proportion to the light of that side which\r\nis illuminated, as that...", "[Footnote 42: Here the text breaks off;\r\nlines 43-52 are written on the margin.].", "If you want to see how much brighter the shaded portion of the moon\r\nis than the background on which it is seen, conceal the luminous\r\nportion of the moon with your hand or with some other more distant\r\nobject.", "On the spots in the moon (903-907).", "903.", "THE SPOTS ON THE MOON.", "Some have said that vapours rise from the moon, after the manner of\r\nclouds and are interposed between the moon and our eyes.", "But, if\r\nthis were the case, these spots would never be permanent, either as\r\nto position or form; and, seeing the moon from various aspects, even\r\nif these spots did not move they would change in form, as objects do\r\nwhich are seen from different sides.", "904.", "OF THE SPOTS ON THE MOON.", "Others say that the moon is composed of more or less transparent\r\nparts; as though one part were something like alabaster and others\r\nlike crystal or glass.", "It would follow from this that the sun\r\ncasting its rays on the less transparent portions, the light would\r\nremain on the surface, and so the denser part would be illuminated,\r\nand the transparent portions would display the shadow of their\r\ndarker depths; and this is their account of the structure and nature\r\nof the moon."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_223", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 223)", "language": "it", "content": "And this opinion has found favour with many\r\nphilosophers, and particularly with Aristotle, and yet it is a false\r\nview--for, in the various phases and frequent changes of the moon\r\nand sun to our eyes, we should see these spots vary, at one time\r\nlooking dark and at another light: they would be dark when the sun\r\nis in the West and the moon in the middle of the sky; for then the\r\ntransparent hollows would be in shadow as far as the tops of the\r\nedges of those transparent hollows, because the sun could not then\r\nfling his rays into the mouth of the hollows, which however, at full\r\nmoon, would be seen in bright light, at which time the moon is in\r\nthe East and faces the sun in the West; then the sun would\r\nilluminate even the lowest depths of these transparent places and\r\nthus, as there would be no shadows cast, the moon at these times\r\nwould not show us the spots in question; and so it would be, now\r\nmore and now less, according to the changes in the position of the\r\nsun to the moon, and of the moon to our eyes, as I have said above. 905. OF THE SPOTS ON THE MOON. It has been asserted, that the spots on the moon result from the\r\nmoon being of varying thinness or density; but if this were so, when\r\nthere is an eclipse of the moon the solar rays would pierce through\r\nthe portions which were thin as is alleged [Footnote 3-5: _Eclissi_. This word, as it seems to me, here means eclipses of the sun; and\r\nthe sense of the passage, as I understand it, is that by the\r\nforegoing hypothesis the moon, when it comes between the sun and the\r\nearth must appear as if pierced,--we may say like a sieve.]. But as\r\nwe do not see this effect the opinion must be false. Others say that the surface of the moon is smooth and polished and\r\nthat, like a mirror, it reflects in itself the image of our earth. This view is also false, inasmuch as the land, where it is not\r\ncovered with water, presents various aspects and forms. Hence when\r\nthe moon is in the East it would reflect different spots from those\r\nit would show when it is above us or in the West; now the spots on\r\nthe moon, as they are seen at full moon, never vary in the course of\r\nits motion over our hemisphere. A second reason is that an object\r\nreflected in a convex body takes up but a small portion of that\r\nbody, as is proved in perspective [Footnote 18: _come e provato_. This alludes to the accompanying diagram.]. The third reason is that\r\nwhen the moon is full, it only faces half the hemisphere of the\r\nilluminated earth, on which only the ocean and other waters reflect\r\nbright light, while the land makes spots on that brightness; thus\r\nhalf of our earth would be seen girt round with the brightness of\r\nthe sea lighted up by the sun, and in the moon this reflection would\r\nbe the smallest part of that moon. Fourthly, a radiant body cannot\r\nbe reflected from another equally radiant; therefore the sea, since\r\nit borrows its brightness from the sun,--as the moon does--, could\r\nnot cause the earth to be reflected in it, nor indeed could the body\r\nof the sun be seen reflected in it, nor indeed any star opposite to\r\nit. 906. If you keep the details of the spots of the moon under observation\r\nyou will often find great variation in them, and this I myself have\r\nproved by drawing them. And this is caused by the clouds that rise\r\nfrom the waters in the moon, which come between the sun and those\r\nwaters, and by their shadow deprive these waters of the sun's rays. Thus those waters remain dark, not being able to reflect the solar\r\nbody. 907. How the spots on the moon must have varied from what they formerly\r\nwere, by reason of the course of its waters. On the moon's halo. 908. OF HALOS ROUND THE MOON.

Define first what is meant by height and depth; also how the\r\nelements are situated one inside another. Then, what is meant by\r\nsolid weight and by liquid weight; but first what weight and\r\nlightness are in themselves. Then describe why water moves, and why\r\nits motion ceases; then why it becomes slower or more rapid; besides\r\nthis, how it always falls, being in contact with the air but lower\r\nthan the air. And how water rises in the air by means of the heat of\r\nthe sun, and then falls again in rain; again, why water springs\r\nforth from the tops of mountains; and if the water of any spring\r\nhigher than the ocean can pour forth water higher than the surface\r\nof that ocean. And how all the water that returns to the ocean is\r\nhigher than the sphere of waters. And how the waters of the\r\nequatorial seas are higher than the waters of the North, and higher\r\nbeneath the body of the sun than in any part of the equatorial\r\ncircle; for experiment shows that under the heat of a burning brand\r\nthe water near the brand boils, and the water surrounding this\r\nebullition always sinks with a circular eddy. And how the waters of\r\nthe North are lower than the other seas, and more so as they become\r\ncolder, until they are converted into ice. Definitions (931. 932). 931. OF WHAT IS WATER. Among the four elements water is the second both in weight and in\r\ninstability. 932. THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK ON WATER.

The centres of the sphere of water are two, one universal and common\r\nto all water, the other particular. The universal one is that which\r\nis common to all waters not in motion, which exist in great\r\nquantities. As canals, ditches, ponds, fountains, wells, dead\r\nrivers, lakes, stagnant pools and seas, which, although they are at\r\nvarious levels, have each in itself the limits of their superficies\r\nequally distant from the centre of the earth, such as lakes placed\r\nat the tops of high mountains; as the lake near Pietra Pana and the\r\nlake of the Sybil near Norcia; and all the lakes that give rise to\r\ngreat rivers, as the Ticino from Lago Maggiore, the Adda from the\r\nlake of Como, the Mincio from the lake of Garda, the Rhine from the\r\nlakes of Constance and of Chur, and from the lake of Lucerne, like\r\nthe Tigris which passes through Asia Minor carrying with it the\r\nwaters of three lakes, one above the other at different heights of\r\nwhich the highest is Munace, the middle one Pallas, and the lowest\r\nTriton; the Nile again flows from three very high lakes in Ethiopia.

OF THE CENTRE OF THE OCEAN. The centre of the sphere of waters is the true centre of the globe\r\nof our world, which is composed of water and earth, having the shape\r\nof a sphere. But, if you want to find the centre of the element of\r\nthe earth, this is placed at a point equidistant from the surface of\r\nthe ocean, and not equidistant from the surface of the earth; for it\r\nis evident that this globe of earth has nowhere any perfect\r\nrotundity, excepting in places where the sea is, or marshes or other\r\nstill waters. And every part of the earth that rises above the water\r\nis farther from the centre. 935. OF THE SEA WHICH CHANGES THE WEIGHT OF THE EARTH. The shells, oysters, and other similar animals, which originate in\r\nsea-mud, bear witness to the changes of the earth round the centre\r\nof our elements. This is proved thus: Great rivers always run\r\nturbid, being coloured by the earth, which is stirred by the\r\nfriction of their waters at the bottom and on their shores; and this\r\nwearing disturbs the face of the strata made by the layers of\r\nshells, which lie on the surface of the marine mud, and which were\r\nproduced there when the salt waters covered them; and these strata\r\nwere covered over again from time to time, with mud of various\r\nthickness, or carried down to the sea by the rivers and floods of\r\nmore or less extent; and thus these layers of mud became raised to\r\nsuch a height, that they came up from the bottom to the air. At the\r\npresent time these bottoms are so high that they form hills or high\r\nmountains, and the rivers, which wear away the sides of these\r\nmountains, uncover the strata of these shells, and thus the softened\r\nside of the earth continually rises and the antipodes sink closer to\r\nthe centre of the earth, and the ancient bottoms of the seas have\r\nbecome mountain ridges. 936.

Of the proportion of the mass of water to that of the earth (937. 938). 937. WHETHER THE EARTH IS LESS THAN THE WATER. Some assert that it is true that the earth, which is not covered by\r\nwater is much less than that covered by water. But considering the\r\nsize of 7000 miles in diameter which is that of this earth, we may\r\nconclude the water to be of small depth. 938. OF THE EARTH. The great elevations of the peaks of the mountains above the sphere\r\nof the water may have resulted from this that: a very large portion\r\nof the earth which was filled with water that is to say the vast\r\ncavern inside the earth may have fallen in a vast part of its vault\r\ntowards the centre of the earth, being pierced by means of the\r\ncourse of the springs which continually wear away the place where\r\nthey pass. Sinking in of countries like the Dead Sea in Syria, that is Sodom\r\nand Gomorrah. It is of necessity that there should be more water than land, and\r\nthe visible portion of the sea does not show this; so that there\r\nmust be a great deal of water inside the earth, besides that which\r\nrises into the lower air and which flows through rivers and springs.

Now the\r\nsame heat which holds up so great a weight of water as is seen to\r\nrain from the clouds, draws them from below upwards, from the foot\r\nof the mountains, and leads and holds them within the summits of the\r\nmountains, and these, finding some fissure, issue continuously and\r\ncause rivers.

OF CERTAIN PERSONS WHO SAY THE WATERS WERE HIGHER THAN THE DRY LAND. Certainly I wonder not a little at the common opinion which is\r\ncontrary to truth, but held by the universal consent of the judgment\r\nof men. And this is that all are agreed that the surface of the sea\r\nis higher than the highest peaks of the mountains; and they allege\r\nmany vain and childish reasons, against which I will allege only one\r\nsimple and short reason; We see plainly that if we could remove the\r\nshores of the sea, it would invest the whole earth and make it a\r\nperfect sphere. Now, consider how much earth would be carried away\r\nto enable the waves of the sea to cover the world; therefore that\r\nwhich would be carried away must be higher than the sea-shore. 944. THE OPINION OF SOME PERSONS WHO SAY THAT THE WATER OF SOME SEAS IS\r\nHIGHER THAN THE HIGHEST SUMMITS OF MOUNTAINS; AND NEVERTHELESS THE\r\nWATER WAS FORCED UP TO THESE SUMMITS. Water would not move from place to place if it were not that it\r\nseeks the lowest level and by a natural consequence it never can\r\nreturn to a height like that of the place where it first on issuing\r\nfrom the mountain came to light. And that portion of the sea which,\r\nin your vain imagining, you say was so high that it flowed over the\r\nsummits of the high mountains, for so many centuries would be\r\nswallowed up and poured out again through the issue from these\r\nmountains. You can well imagine that all the time that Tigris and\r\nEuphrates\r\n\r\n945. have flowed from the summits of the mountains of Armenia, it must be\r\nbelieved that all the water of the ocean has passed very many times\r\nthrough these mouths. And do you not believe that the Nile must have\r\nsent more water into the sea than at present exists of all the\r\nelement of water? Undoubtedly, yes. And if all this water had fallen\r\naway from this body of the earth, this terrestrial machine would\r\nlong since have been without water. Whence we may conclude that the\r\nwater goes from the rivers to the sea, and from the sea to the\r\nrivers, thus constantly circulating and returning, and that all the\r\nsea and the rivers have passed through the mouth of the Nile an\r\ninfinite number of times [Footnote: _Moti Armeni, Ermini_ in the\r\noriginal, in M. RAVAISSON'S transcript _\"monti ernini [le loro\r\nruine?]\"_. He renders this _\"Le Tigre et l'Euphrate se sont deverses\r\npar les sommets des montagnes [avec leurs eaux destructives?] on\r\npent cro're\" &c. Leonardo always writes _Ermini, Erminia_, for\r\n_Armeni, Armenia_ (Arabic: _Irminiah_). M. RAVAISSON also deviates\r\nfrom the original in his translation of the following passage: \"_Or\r\ntu ne crois pas que le Nil ait mis plus d'eau dans la mer qu'il n'y\r\nen a a present dans tout l'element de l'eau. Il est certain que si\r\ncette eau etait tombee_\" &c.]\r\n\r\nII. ON THE OCEAN. Refutation of Pliny's theory as to the saltness of the sea (946. 947). 946. WHY WATER IS SALT. Pliny says in his second book, chapter 103, that the water of the\r\nsea is salt because the heat of the sun dries up the moisture and\r\ndrinks it up; and this gives to the wide stretching sea the savour\r\nof salt. But this cannot be admitted, because if the saltness of the\r\nsea were caused by the heat of the sun, there can be no doubt that\r\nlakes, pools and marshes would be so much the more salt, as their\r\nwaters have less motion and are of less depth; but experience shows\r\nus, on the contrary, that these lakes have their waters quite free\r\nfrom salt. Again it is stated by Pliny in the same chapter that this\r\nsaltness might originate, because all the sweet and subtle portions\r\nwhich the heat attracts easily being taken away, the more bitter and\r\ncoarser part will remain, and thus the water on the surface is\r\nfresher than at the bottom [Footnote 22: Compare No.", "sentences": ["Obviously no portions of dry land left uncovered by water can ever\r\nbe lower than the surface of the watery sphere.", "943.", "OF CERTAIN PERSONS WHO SAY THE WATERS WERE HIGHER THAN THE DRY LAND.", "Certainly I wonder not a little at the common opinion which is\r\ncontrary to truth, but held by the universal consent of the judgment\r\nof men.", "And this is that all are agreed that the surface of the sea\r\nis higher than the highest peaks of the mountains; and they allege\r\nmany vain and childish reasons, against which I will allege only one\r\nsimple and short reason; We see plainly that if we could remove the\r\nshores of the sea, it would invest the whole earth and make it a\r\nperfect sphere.", "Now, consider how much earth would be carried away\r\nto enable the waves of the sea to cover the world; therefore that\r\nwhich would be carried away must be higher than the sea-shore.", "944.", "THE OPINION OF SOME PERSONS WHO SAY THAT THE WATER OF SOME SEAS IS\r\nHIGHER THAN THE HIGHEST SUMMITS OF MOUNTAINS; AND NEVERTHELESS THE\r\nWATER WAS FORCED UP TO THESE SUMMITS.", "Water would not move from place to place if it were not that it\r\nseeks the lowest level and by a natural consequence it never can\r\nreturn to a height like that of the place where it first on issuing\r\nfrom the mountain came to light.", "And that portion of the sea which,\r\nin your vain imagining, you say was so high that it flowed over the\r\nsummits of the high mountains, for so many centuries would be\r\nswallowed up and poured out again through the issue from these\r\nmountains.", "You can well imagine that all the time that Tigris and\r\nEuphrates\r\n\r\n945.", "have flowed from the summits of the mountains of Armenia, it must be\r\nbelieved that all the water of the ocean has passed very many times\r\nthrough these mouths.", "And do you not believe that the Nile must have\r\nsent more water into the sea than at present exists of all the\r\nelement of water?", "Undoubtedly, yes.", "And if all this water had fallen\r\naway from this body of the earth, this terrestrial machine would\r\nlong since have been without water.", "Whence we may conclude that the\r\nwater goes from the rivers to the sea, and from the sea to the\r\nrivers, thus constantly circulating and returning, and that all the\r\nsea and the rivers have passed through the mouth of the Nile an\r\ninfinite number of times [Footnote: _Moti Armeni, Ermini_ in the\r\noriginal, in M.", "RAVAISSON'S transcript _\"monti ernini [le loro\r\nruine?]\"_.", "He renders this _\"Le Tigre et l'Euphrate se sont deverses\r\npar les sommets des montagnes [avec leurs eaux destructives?] on\r\npent cro're\" &c.", "Leonardo always writes _Ermini, Erminia_, for\r\n_Armeni, Armenia_ (Arabic: _Irminiah_).", "M.", "RAVAISSON also deviates\r\nfrom the original in his translation of the following passage: \"_Or\r\ntu ne crois pas que le Nil ait mis plus d'eau dans la mer qu'il n'y\r\nen a a present dans tout l'element de l'eau.", "Il est certain que si\r\ncette eau etait tombee_\" &c.]\r\n\r\nII.", "ON THE OCEAN.", "Refutation of Pliny's theory as to the saltness of the sea (946.", "947).", "946.", "WHY WATER IS SALT.", "Pliny says in his second book, chapter 103, that the water of the\r\nsea is salt because the heat of the sun dries up the moisture and\r\ndrinks it up; and this gives to the wide stretching sea the savour\r\nof salt.", "But this cannot be admitted, because if the saltness of the\r\nsea were caused by the heat of the sun, there can be no doubt that\r\nlakes, pools and marshes would be so much the more salt, as their\r\nwaters have less motion and are of less depth; but experience shows\r\nus, on the contrary, that these lakes have their waters quite free\r\nfrom salt.", "Again it is stated by Pliny in the same chapter that this\r\nsaltness might originate, because all the sweet and subtle portions\r\nwhich the heat attracts easily being taken away, the more bitter and\r\ncoarser part will remain, and thus the water on the surface is\r\nfresher than at the bottom [Footnote 22: Compare No."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "da Vinci Leonardo"}, {"id": "txt_it_5000_232", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (Part 232)", "language": "it", "content": "948.]; but this\r\nis contradicted by the same reason given above, which is, that the\r\nsame thing would happen in marshes and other waters, which are dried\r\nup by the heat. Again, it has been said that the saltness of the sea\r\nis the sweat of the earth; to this it may be answered that all the\r\nsprings of water which penetrate through the earth, would then be\r\nsalt. But the conclusion is, that the saltness of the sea must\r\nproceed from the many springs of water which, as they penetrate into\r\nthe earth, find mines of salt and these they dissolve in part, and\r\ncarry with them to the ocean and the other seas, whence the clouds,\r\nthe begetters of rivers, never carry it up. And the sea would be\r\nsalter in our times than ever it was at any time; and if the\r\nadversary were to say that in infinite time the sea would dry up or\r\ncongeal into salt, to this I answer that this salt is restored to\r\nthe earth by the setting free of that part of the earth which rises\r\nout of the sea with the salt it has acquired, and the rivers return\r\nit to the earth under the sea. [Footnote: See PLINY, Hist. Nat. II, CIII [C]. _Itaque Solis ardore\r\nsiccatur liquor: et hoc esse masculum sidus accepimus, torrens\r\ncuncta sorbensque._ (cp. CIV.) _Sic mari late patenti saporem\r\nincoqui salis, aut quia exhausto inde dulci tenuique, quod facillime\r\ntrahat vis ignea, omne asperius crassiusque linquatur: ideo summa\r\naequorum aqua dulciorem profundam; hanc esse veriorem causam, quam\r\nquod mare terrae sudor sit aeternus: aut quia plurimum ex arido\r\nmisceatur illi vapore: aut quia terrae natura sicut medicatas aquas\r\ninficiat_ ...

Ideo et marinae, quarum natura gravior, magis invecta\r\nsustinent. Quaedam vero et dulces inter se supermeant alias._]\r\n\r\n947. For the third and last reason we will say that salt is in all\r\ncreated things; and this we learn from water passed over the ashes\r\nand cinders of burnt things; and the urine of every animal, and the\r\nsuperfluities issuing from their bodies, and the earth into which\r\nall things are converted by corruption. But,--to put it better,--given that the world is everlasting, it\r\nmust be admitted that its population will also be eternal; hence the\r\nhuman species has eternally been and would be consumers of salt; and\r\nif all the mass of the earth were to be turned into salt, it would\r\nnot suffice for all human food [Footnote 27: That is, on the\r\nsupposition that salt, once consumed, disappears for ever.]; whence\r\nwe are forced to admit, either that the species of salt must be\r\neverlasting like the world, or that it dies and is born again like\r\nthe men who devour it. But as experience teaches us that it does not\r\ndie, as is evident by fire, which does not consume it, and by water\r\nwhich becomes salt in proportion to the quantity dissolved in\r\nit,--and when it is evaporated the salt always remains in the\r\noriginal quantity--it must pass through the bodies of men either in\r\nthe urine or the sweat or other excretions where it is found again;\r\nand as much salt is thus got rid of as is carried every year into\r\ntowns; therefore salt is dug in places where there is urine.-- Sea\r\nhogs and sea winds are salt. We will say that the rains which penetrate the earth are what is\r\nunder the foundations of cities with their inhabitants, and are what\r\nrestore through the internal passages of the earth the saltness\r\ntaken from the sea; and that the change in the place of the sea,\r\nwhich has been over all the mountains, caused it to be left there in\r\nthe mines found in those mountains, &c.

THAT THE OCEAN DOES NOT PENETRATE UNDER THE EARTH. The ocean does not penetrate under the earth, and this we learn from\r\nthe many and various springs of fresh water which, in many parts of\r\nthe ocean make their way up from the bottom to the surface. The same\r\nthing is farther proved by wells dug beyond the distance of a mile\r\nfrom the said ocean, which fill with fresh water; and this happens\r\nbecause the fresh water is lighter than salt water and consequently\r\nmore penetrating. Which weighs most, water when frozen or when not frozen? FRESH WATER PENETRATES MORE AGAINST SALT WATER THAN SALT WATER\r\nAGAINST FRESH WATER. That fresh water penetrates more against salt water, than salt water\r\nagainst fresh is proved by a thin cloth dry and old, hanging with\r\nthe two opposite ends equally low in the two different waters, the\r\nsurfaces of which are at an equal level; and it will then be seen\r\nhow much higher the fresh water will rise in this piece of linen\r\nthan the salt; by so much is the fresh lighter than the salt.

HERE THE REASON IS GIVEN OF THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE WATERS IN\r\nTHE ABOVE MENTIONED PLACE. All the lakes and all the gulfs of the sea and all inland seas are\r\ndue to rivers which distribute their waters into them, and from\r\nimpediments in their downfall into the Mediterranean --which divides\r\nAfrica from Europe and Europe from Asia by means of the Nile and the\r\nDon which pour their waters into it.

OF WAVES. A wave of the sea always breaks in front of its base, and that\r\nportion of the crest will then be lowest which before was highest. [Footnote: The page of FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO'S _Trattato_, on which\r\nLeonardo has written this remark, contains some notes on the\r\nconstruction of dams, harbours &c.]\r\n\r\n953. That the shores of the sea constantly acquire more soil towards the\r\nmiddle of the sea; that the rocks and promontories of the sea are\r\nconstantly being ruined and worn away; that the Mediterranean seas\r\nwill in time discover their bottom to the air, and all that will be\r\nleft will be the channel of the greatest river that enters it; and\r\nthis will run to the ocean and pour its waters into that with those\r\nof all the rivers that are its tributaries. 954. How the river Po, in a short time might dry up the Adriatic sea in\r\nthe same way as it has dried up a large part of Lombardy. The ebb and flow of the tide (955-960). 955. Where there is a larger quantity of water, there is a greater flow\r\nand ebb, but the contrary in narrow waters. Look whether the sea is at its greatest flow when the moon is half\r\nway over our hemisphere [on the meridian]. 956.

And again it is caused by whirlpools. 958. OF THE FLOW AND EBB. All seas have their flow and ebb in the same period, but they seem\r\nto vary because the days do not begin at the same time throughout\r\nthe universe; in such wise as that when it is midday in our\r\nhemisphere, it is midnight in the opposite hemisphere; and at the\r\nEastern boundary of the two hemispheres the night begins which\r\nfollows on the day, and at the Western boundary of these hemispheres\r\nbegins the day, which follows the night from the opposite side. Hence it is to be inferred that the above mentioned swelling and\r\ndiminution in the height of the seas, although they take place in\r\none and the same space of time, are seen to vary from the above\r\nmentioned causes. The waters are then withdrawn into the fissures\r\nwhich start from the depths of the sea and which ramify inside the\r\nbody of the earth, corresponding to the sources of rivers, which are\r\nconstantly taking from the bottom of the sea the water which has\r\nflowed into it. A sea of water is incessantly being drawn off from\r\nthe surface of the sea. And if you should think that the moon,\r\nrising at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean sea must there begin\r\nto attract to herself the waters of the sea, it would follow that we\r\nmust at once see the effect of it at the Eastern end of that sea. Again, as the Mediterranean sea is about the eighth part of the\r\ncircumference of the aqueous sphere, being 3000 miles long, while\r\nthe flow and ebb only occur 4 times in 24 hours, these results would\r\nnot agree with the time of 24 hours, unless this Mediterranean sea\r\nwere six thousand miles in length; because if such a superabundance\r\nof water had to pass through the straits of Gibraltar in running\r\nbehind the moon, the rush of the water through that strait would be\r\nso great, and would rise to such a height, that beyond the straits\r\nit would for many miles rush so violently into the ocean as to cause\r\nfloods and tremendous seething, so that it would be impossible to\r\npass through. This agitated ocean would afterwards return the waters\r\nit had received with equal fury to the place they had come from, so\r\nthat no one ever could pass through those straits. Now experience\r\nshows that at every hour they are passed in safety, but when the\r\nwind sets in the same direction as the current, the strong ebb\r\nincreases [Footnote 23: In attempting to get out of the\r\nMediterranean, vessels are sometimes detained for a considerable\r\ntime; not merely by the causes mentioned by Leonardo but by the\r\nconstant current flowing eastwards through the middle of the straits\r\nof Gibraltar.]. The sea does not raise the water that has issued\r\nfrom the straits, but it checks them and this retards the tide; then\r\nit makes up with furious haste for the time it has lost until the\r\nend of the ebb movement. 959. That the flow and ebb are not general; for on the shore at Genoa\r\nthere is none, at Venice two braccia, between England and Flanders\r\n18 braccia. That in the straits of Sicily the current is very strong\r\nbecause all the waters from the rivers that flow into the Adriatic\r\npass there. [Footnote: A few more recent data may be given here to facilitate\r\ncomparison. In the Adriatic the tide rises 2 and 1/2 feet, at\r\nTerracina 1 1/4. In the English channel between Calais and Kent it\r\nrises from 18 to 20 feet. In the straits of Messina it rises no more\r\nthan 2 1/2 feet, and that only in stormy weather, but the current is\r\nall the stronger. When Leonardo accounts for this by the southward\r\nflow of all the Italian rivers along the coasts, the explanation is\r\nat least based on a correct observation; namely that a steady\r\ncurrent flows southwards along the coast of Calabria and another\r\nnorthwards, along the shores of Sicily;

but\r\n20 braccia is the general rule, and this rule, as it is evident,\r\ncannot have the moon for its cause. This variation in the increase\r\nand decrease of the sea every 6 hours may arise from the damming up\r\nof the waters, which are poured into the Mediterranean by the\r\nquantity of rivers from Africa, Asia and Europe, which flow into\r\nthat sea, and the waters which are given to it by those rivers; it\r\npours them to the ocean through the straits of Gibraltar, between\r\nAbila and Calpe [Footnote 5: _Abila_, Lat. _Abyla_, Gr. , now\r\nSierra _Ximiera_ near Ceuta; _Calpe_, Lat. _Calpe_. Gr., now\r\nGibraltar. Leonardo here uses the ancient names of the rocks, which\r\nwere known as the Pillars of Hercules.]. That ocean extends to the\r\nisland of England and others farther North, and it becomes dammed up\r\nand kept high in various gulfs. These, being seas of which the\r\nsurface is remote from the centre of the earth, have acquired a\r\nweight, which as it is greater than the force of the incoming waters\r\nwhich cause it, gives this water an impetus in the contrary\r\ndirection to that in which it came and it is borne back to meet the\r\nwaters coming out of the straits; and this it does most against the\r\nstraits of Gibraltar; these, so long as this goes on, remain dammed\r\nup and all the water which is poured out meanwhile by the\r\naforementioned rivers, is pent up [in the Mediterranean]; and this\r\nmight be assigned as the cause of its flow and ebb, as is shown in\r\nthe 21st of the 4th of my theory. III. SUBTERRANEAN WATER COURSES. Theory of the circulation of the waters (961. 962). 961. Very large rivers flow under ground. 962. This is meant to represent the earth cut through in the middle,\r\nshowing the depths of the sea and of the earth; the waters start\r\nfrom the bottom of the seas, and ramifying through the earth they\r\nrise to the summits of the mountains, flowing back by the rivers and\r\nreturning to the sea. Observations in support of the hypothesis (963-969). 963. The waters circulate with constant motion from the utmost depths of\r\nthe sea to the highest summits of the mountains, not obeying the\r\nnature of heavy matter; and in this case it acts as does the blood\r\nof animals which is always moving from the sea of the heart and\r\nflows to the top of their heads; and here it is that veins burst--as\r\none may see when a vein bursts in the nose, that all the blood from\r\nbelow rises to the level of the burst vein. When the water rushes\r\nout of a burst vein in the earth it obeys the nature of other things\r\nheavier than the air, whence it always seeks the lowest places. [7]\r\nThese waters traverse the body of the earth with infinite\r\nramifications. [Footnote: The greater part of this passage has been given as No. 849 in the section on Anatomy.]\r\n\r\n964. The same cause which stirs the humours in every species of animal\r\nbody and by which every injury is repaired, also moves the waters\r\nfrom the utmost depth of the sea to the greatest heights. 965. It is the property of water that it constitutes the vital human of\r\nthis arid earth; and the cause which moves it through its ramified\r\nveins, against the natural course of heavy matters, is the same\r\nproperty which moves the humours in every species of animal body.

OF SPRINGS OF WATER ON THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS. It is quite evident that the whole surface of the ocean--when there\r\nis no storm--is at an equal distance from the centre of the earth,\r\nand that the tops of the mountains are farther from this centre in\r\nproportion as they rise above the surface of that sea; therefore if\r\nthe body of the earth were not like that of man, it would be\r\nimpossible that the waters of the sea--being so much lower than the\r\nmountains--could by their nature rise up to the summits of these\r\nmountains.

And\r\nthis water, which passes through a closed conduit inside the body of\r\nthe mountain like a dead thing, cannot come forth from its low place\r\nunless it is warmed by the vital heat of the spring time. Again, the\r\nheat of the element of fire and, by day, the heat of the sun, have\r\npower to draw forth the moisture of the low parts of the mountains\r\nand to draw them up, in the same way as it draws the clouds and\r\ncollects their moisture from the bed of the sea. 969.

OF RIVERS. On the way in which the sources of rivers are fed. 970. OF THE ORIGIN OF RIVERS. The body of the earth, like the bodies of animals, is intersected\r\nwith ramifications of waters which are all in connection and are\r\nconstituted to give nutriment and life to the earth and to its\r\ncreatures. These come from the depth of the sea and, after many\r\nrevolutions, have to return to it by the rivers created by the\r\nbursting of these springs; and if you chose to say that the rains of\r\nthe winter or the melting of the snows in summer were the cause of\r\nthe birth of rivers, I could mention the rivers which originate in\r\nthe torrid countries of Africa, where it never rains--and still less\r\nsnows--because the intense heat always melts into air all the clouds\r\nwhich are borne thither by the winds. And if you chose to say that\r\nsuch rivers, as increase in July and August, come from the snows\r\nwhich melt in May and June from the sun's approach to the snows on\r\nthe mountains of Scythia [Footnote 9: Scythia means here, as in\r\nAncient Geography, the whole of the Northern part of Asia as far as\r\nIndia.], and that such meltings come down into certain valleys and\r\nform lakes, into which they enter by springs and subterranean caves\r\nto issue forth again at the sources of the Nile, this is false;\r\nbecause Scythia is lower than the sources of the Nile, and, besides,\r\nScythia is only 400 miles from the Black sea and the sources of the\r\nNile are 3000 miles distant from the sea of Egypt into which its\r\nwaters flow. The tide in estuaries. 971. Book 9, of the meeting of rivers and of their ebb and flow. The\r\ncause is the same in the sea, where it is caused by the straits of\r\nGibraltar; and again it is caused by whirlpools. [3] If two rivers meet together to form a straight line, and then\r\nbelow two right angles take their course together, the flow and ebb\r\nwill happen now in one river and now in the other above their\r\nconfluence, and principally if the outlet for their united volume is\r\nno swifter than when they were separate. Here occur 4 instances. [Footnote: The first two lines of this passage have already been\r\ngiven as No. 957. In the margin, near line 3 of this passage, the\r\ntext given as No. 919 is written.]\r\n\r\nOn the alterations, caused in the courses of rivers by their\r\nconfluence (972-974). 972. When a smaller river pours its waters into a larger one, and that\r\nlarger one flows from the opposite direction, the course of the\r\nsmaller river will bend up against the approach of the larger river;\r\nand this happens because, when the larger river fills up all its bed\r\nwith water, it makes an eddy in front of the mouth of the other\r\nriver, and so carries the water poured in by the smaller river with\r\nits own. When the smaller river pours its waters into the larger\r\none, which runs across the current at the mouth of the smaller\r\nriver, its waters will bend with the downward movement of the larger\r\nriver. [Footnote: In the original sketches the word _Arno_ is\r\nwritten at the spot here marked _A_, at _R. Rifredi_, and at _M. Mugnone_.]\r\n\r\n973. When the fulness of rivers is diminished, then the acute angles\r\nformed at the junction of their branches become shorter at the sides\r\nand wider at the point; like the current _a n_ and the current _d\r\nn_, which unite in _n_ when the river is at its greatest fulness.

FOREWORD\r\n\r\nAugust Strindberg died at Stockholm On May 14, 1912, just ten days\r\nafter the first of his plays given in English in the United States had\r\ncompleted a month's engagement. This play was \"The Father,\" which, on\r\nApril 9, 1912, was produced at the Berkeley Theatre in New York, the\r\nsame little theatre that witnessed in 1894 the first performance in this\r\ncountry of Ibsen's \"Ghosts.\"\r\n\r\nIt happened that August Lindberg, the eminent Swedish actor and friend\r\nof Strindberg [who, by the way, was the first producer of \"Ghosts\" in\r\nany language], was visiting this country and came to see a performance\r\nof \"The Father.\" His enthusiasm over the interpretation given\r\nStrindberg, in the English rendering of the play as well as in the\r\nacting, led him to cable a congratulatory message to Strindberg; and\r\nupon departing for Stockholm, he asked for some of the many letters\r\nof appreciation from significant sources which the production of \"The\r\nFather\" had called forth. These he wished to give to Strindberg as\r\nfurther assurance \"that he has,\" to use Herr Lindberg's words, \"the\r\nright representatives in this country.\" It is gratifying to those\r\nwho esteem it a rare privilege to be the introducers of Strindberg's\r\npowerful dramatic art to the American stage to know that he finally\r\nfound his genius recognized on this side of the ocean. \"Comrades,\" the first play in the present volume, belongs to the same\r\nmomentous creative period as \"The Father\" and \"Countess Julie,\" although\r\nthere is little anecdotic history attaching to this vigorous comedy. It\r\nwas written in Denmark, where Strindberg, after finishing \"The Father\"\r\nin Switzerland in 1887, went with his family to live for two years, and\r\nwas published March 21, 1888.

The period of Strindberg's sojourn in Switzerland, 1884-87, was most\r\nimportant in the evolution of the character and work of the man who,\r\nthroughout his career, was to engage himself so penetratingly and\r\npassionately in the psychology of woman, and love, and the problems of\r\nmarriage, as to acquire the reputation, undeserved though it was, of\r\nwoman-hater. That this observation and analysis of woman was not induced\r\nby natural antipathy to the sex, nor by unhappiness in his own married\r\nexperience, is made clear by the facts of his life up to the time when\r\nsuch investigation was undertaken. What, then, did sway him to such\r\na choice of theme? Examination of the data of this period from\r\nStrindberg's own annals reveals the following influences: Ibsen from\r\nhis Norwegian throne had hailed woman and the laborer as the two rising\r\nranks of nobility, and Strindberg asked himself if this was ironic, as\r\nusual, or prophetic. Feminine individualism was the cult of the hour. The younger generation had, through the doctrines of evolution, become\r\natheistic. Strindberg tells of asking a young writer how he could get\r\nalong without God. \"We have woman instead,\" was the reply. This was\r\nthe last stage of Madonna worship! And how had it happened that the new\r\ngeneration had replaced God with woman? \"God was the remotest source;\r\nwhen he failed they grasped at the next, the mother. But then they\r\nshould at least choose the real mother, the real woman, before whom, no\r\nmatter how strong his spirit, man will always bow when she appears with\r\nher life-giving attributes. But the younger generation had pronounced\r\ncontempt for the mother, and in her place had set up the loathsome,\r\nsterile, degenerate amazon--the blue-stocking!\"\r\n\r\nEarnestly pondering these matters, Strindberg at length decided to write\r\na book about woman, a subject, he declares, which up to this time he had\r\nnot wanted to think about, as he himself \"lived in a happy erotic state,\r\nennobled and beautified by the rejuvenating and expiatory arrival of\r\nchildren.\" But nevertheless he decided to write such a book, and so with\r\nsympathy and much old-fashioned veneration for motherhood the task was\r\nundertaken. Regarding the mother as down-trodden, he wanted to think out a means\r\nfor her deliverance. To obtain a clear vision he chose as a method the\r\ndelineation of as large a number as possible of marriage cases that he\r\nhad seen--and he had seen many, as most of his contemporary friends were\r\nmarried. Of these he chose twelve, the most characteristic, and then he\r\nwent to work. When he had written about half that number, he stopped and\r\nreviewed the collection. The result was entirely different from what he\r\nhad expected. Then chance came to his aid, for in the pension where he was living,\r\nthirty women were stopping. He saw them at all meals, between meals, and\r\nall about, idle, gossiping, pretentious, longing for pleasure. \"There\r\nwere learned ladies who left the Saturday Review behind them on the\r\nchairs; there were literary ladies, young ladies, beautiful ladies.\"\r\nWhen he saw their care-free, idle life, with concern he asked himself:\r\n\"Whom do these parasites and their children live on?\" Then he discovered\r\nthe bread-winners. \"The husband sat in his dark office far away in\r\nLondon; the husband was far away with a detachment in Tonkin; the\r\nhusband was at work in his bureau in Paris; the husband had gone on a\r\nbusiness trip to Australia.\" And the three men who were there gave\r\nhim occasion to reflect about the so-called female slave.", "sentences": ["The\r\ndialogue is so concentrated that it seems as if not one line could be\r\ncut without the whole structure falling to pieces, and in these terse\r\nspeeches a genius is revealed that, with something of the divine touch,\r\nsounds the depths of the human heart and reveals its inmost thoughts.", "\"Pariah\" was published in 1890 and \"Facing Death\" in 1898.", "The period of Strindberg's sojourn in Switzerland, 1884-87, was most\r\nimportant in the evolution of the character and work of the man who,\r\nthroughout his career, was to engage himself so penetratingly and\r\npassionately in the psychology of woman, and love, and the problems of\r\nmarriage, as to acquire the reputation, undeserved though it was, of\r\nwoman-hater.", "That this observation and analysis of woman was not induced\r\nby natural antipathy to the sex, nor by unhappiness in his own married\r\nexperience, is made clear by the facts of his life up to the time when\r\nsuch investigation was undertaken.", "What, then, did sway him to such\r\na choice of theme?", "Examination of the data of this period from\r\nStrindberg's own annals reveals the following influences: Ibsen from\r\nhis Norwegian throne had hailed woman and the laborer as the two rising\r\nranks of nobility, and Strindberg asked himself if this was ironic, as\r\nusual, or prophetic.", "Feminine individualism was the cult of the hour.", "The younger generation had, through the doctrines of evolution, become\r\natheistic.", "Strindberg tells of asking a young writer how he could get\r\nalong without God.", "\"We have woman instead,\" was the reply.", "This was\r\nthe last stage of Madonna worship!", "And how had it happened that the new\r\ngeneration had replaced God with woman?", "\"God was the remotest source;\r\nwhen he failed they grasped at the next, the mother.", "But then they\r\nshould at least choose the real mother, the real woman, before whom, no\r\nmatter how strong his spirit, man will always bow when she appears with\r\nher life-giving attributes.", "But the younger generation had pronounced\r\ncontempt for the mother, and in her place had set up the loathsome,\r\nsterile, degenerate amazon--the blue-stocking!\"\r\n\r\nEarnestly pondering these matters, Strindberg at length decided to write\r\na book about woman, a subject, he declares, which up to this time he had\r\nnot wanted to think about, as he himself \"lived in a happy erotic state,\r\nennobled and beautified by the rejuvenating and expiatory arrival of\r\nchildren.\" But nevertheless he decided to write such a book, and so with\r\nsympathy and much old-fashioned veneration for motherhood the task was\r\nundertaken.", "Regarding the mother as down-trodden, he wanted to think out a means\r\nfor her deliverance.", "To obtain a clear vision he chose as a method the\r\ndelineation of as large a number as possible of marriage cases that he\r\nhad seen--and he had seen many, as most of his contemporary friends were\r\nmarried.", "Of these he chose twelve, the most characteristic, and then he\r\nwent to work.", "When he had written about half that number, he stopped and\r\nreviewed the collection.", "The result was entirely different from what he\r\nhad expected.", "Then chance came to his aid, for in the pension where he was living,\r\nthirty women were stopping.", "He saw them at all meals, between meals, and\r\nall about, idle, gossiping, pretentious, longing for pleasure.", "\"There\r\nwere learned ladies who left the Saturday Review behind them on the\r\nchairs;

An elderly man passed by,\r\nwho, although himself a brisk walker, was now leading his sickly wife\r\nstep by step, his hand supporting her back when making an ascent; he\r\ncarried her shawls, chair, and other little necessities, reverently,\r\nlovingly, as if he had become her son when she had ceased to be his\r\nwife. And there sat King Lear with his daughter,--it was terrible\r\nto see. He was over sixty, had had eight children, six of whom were\r\ndaughters, and who, in his days of affluence, he had allowed to manage\r\nhis house and, no doubt, the economy thereof. Now he was poor, had\r\nnothing, and they had all deserted him except one daughter who had\r\ninherited a small income from an aunt. And the former giant, who had\r\nbeen able to work for a household of twelve, crushed by the disgrace of\r\nbankruptcy, was forced to feel the humiliation of accepting support\r\nfrom his daughter, who went about with her twenty-nine women friends,\r\nreceiving their comfort and condolence, weeping over her fate, and\r\nsometimes actually wishing the life out of her father.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of all this observation and consequent analysis was\r\nthe collection of short stories in two volumes called \"Marriages,\" the\r\nfirst of which, published in 1884, gave rise to Strindberg's reputation\r\nof being a pessimist, and the second, two years later, to that of\r\nwoman-hater, which became confirmed by the portrayals of women in his\r\nrealistic dramas that soon followed, notably that of Laura in \"The\r\nFather.\" That part of the woman-hater legend which one encounters most\r\noften is that Strindberg was revealing his own marital miseries in\r\nthe sex conflicts of these dramas, particularly in \"The Father,\"\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that this play was written five years before\r\nhis first marriage was dissolved, and little more than two years after\r\nhis avowed hesitancy to undertake the dissection of womankind on account\r\nof the \"happy erotic state\" in which he was living. And that his analytical labors and personal experiences, far from\r\nbringing about an acquired aversion for woman, never even let him be\r\nwarned, is attested by the fact of his having founded three families. One is forced to suspect that instead of being a woman-hater, he was\r\nrather a disguised and indefatigable lover of woman, and that his wars\r\non woman and his fruitless endeavors to get into harmony with the other\r\nhalf of the race were, fundamentally, a warring within himself of\r\nhis own many-sided, rich nature. He said of himself that he had been\r\nsentenced by his nature to be the faultfinder, to see the other side of\r\nthings. He hated the Don Juans among men as intensely as he did the lazy\r\nparasites among women--the rich and spoiled ones who declaimed loudest\r\nabout woman's holy duties as wife and mother, but whose time was given\r\nup to being hysterical and thinking out foolish acts,--these women\r\nenraged him. However, the psychology of woman represents but one phase of Strindberg. In a book called \"The Author,\" styled by him \"a self-evolutionary\r\nhistory,\" which was written during the germinating period of the\r\nrealistic dramas, but was not given out for publication until 1909,\r\nthere is a foreword which contains the following significant avowal from\r\nthe Strindberg of the last years: \"The author had not arrived in 1886;\r\nperhaps only came into being then.

The play, \"Easter,\" included in the present collection, belongs to this\r\nperiod; it is a strange mingling of symbolism and realism, bearing the\r\nspiritual message of the resurrection.

But I belong to a circle of comrades who have\r\npromised each other not to wear their merit on their coats. BERTHA. But who have accepted salon medals! AXEL. Which are not worn on their coats. BERTHA. What do you say to this, Gaga? WILLMER. As long as distinctions exist, one does one's self harm to\r\ngo about with the mark of infamy, and the example no one is likely to\r\nfollow. Take them away for all of me--I certainly can't get them away\r\nfrom the others. AXEL. Yes, and when my comrades who are more deserving than I do not\r\nwear them, I would lower them by wearing the emblem. BERTHA. But it doesn't show under your overcoat. No one will know, and\r\nyou won't brand any one. WILLMER. Bertha is right there. You'll wear your order _under_ your\r\ncoat, not _on_ your coat. AXEL. Jesuits! When you are given a finger, you take the whole arm. [Abel comes in wearing fur coat and cap.]\r\n\r\nBERTHA. Oh, here's Abel! Come on, now, and settle this controversy. ABEL. Hello, Bertha! Hello, Axel! How are you, Gaga? What's the matter? BERTHA. Axel doesn't want to wear his order, because he daren't on\r\naccount of his comrades. ABEL.

I feel that what you people are saying is false, but I haven't the\r\ntime or energy to answer you now; but there is an answer! It's as if you\r\nwere drawing a net about me while I sit absorbed in my work. I can feel\r\nthe net winding about me, but my foot gets entangled when I want to kick\r\nit aside.

But of course he hasn't received\r\nthe notice yet. BERTHA. No, not that I know of. But, Abel, are you sure that Axel will\r\nmeet Madame Roubey and not Monsieur? ABEL. What should he see Monsieur Roubey for? He hasn't any say about\r\nit, but she is president of the Woman-Painters Protective Society. BERTHA. And I am not refused--yet? ABEL. No, as I said, and Axel's call is bound to do good. He has a\r\nRussian order, and everything Russian is very popular in Paris just now. But it's too had about Axel just the same. BERTHA. Too bad? Why? They haven't room for everybody on the salon\r\nwalls. There are so many women refused that a man might put up with it\r\nand be made to feel it for once. But if I get in now--we'll soon hear\r\nhow _he_ painted my picture, how _he_ has taught me, how _he_ has paid\r\nfor my lessons. But I shall not take any notice of that, because it\r\nisn't true. WILLMER. Well, we're bound to see something unusual happen now. BERTHA. No, I believe--granted that I am not refused--that we'll see\r\nsomething very usual.

No, I won't answer that. ABEL. Because, if you are accepted, the equality will be destroyed, as\r\nyou will be his superior. BERTHA. Superior? A wife superior to her husband--her husband--oh!

Oh, I feel\r\nthat a great hate is beginning to grow in here. [Indicating his breast.]\r\n\r\nBERTHA. Perhaps I look delighted because I've had a success, but when\r\none is tied to a man who cannot rejoice in another's good fortune, it's\r\ndifficult to sympathize with his misfortune. AXEL. I don't know why, but it seems as if we had become enemies now. The strife of position has come between us, and we can never be friends\r\nany more. BERTHA. Can't your sense of justice bend and recognize me as the abler,\r\nthe victorious one in the strife? AXEL. You are not the abler. BERTHA. The jury must have thought so, however. AXEL. But surely you know that I paint better than you do. BERTHA. Are you so sure of that? AXEL. Yes, I am. But for that matter--you worked under better conditions\r\nthan I. You didn't have to do any pot-boiling, you could go to the\r\nstudio, you had models, and you were a woman! BERTHA. Yes, now I'll hear how I have lived on you--\r\n\r\nAXEL. Between ourselves, yes, but the world won't know unless you go and\r\ntell it yourself. BERTHA. Oh, the world knows that already. But tell me, why don't you\r\nsuffer when a comrade, a man comrade, is accepted, although he has less\r\nmerit than you? AXEL. I'll have to think about that. You see our feeling toward you\r\nwomen has never been critical--we've taken you as a matter of course,\r\nand so I've never thought about our relations as against each other. Now\r\nwhen the shoe pinches, it strikes me that we are not comrades, for this\r\nexperience makes me feel that you women do not belong here. [Indicating\r\nthe studio.] A comrade is a more or less loyal competitor; we are\r\nenemies. You women have been lying down in the rear while we attacked\r\nthe enemy. And now, when we have set and supplied the table, you pounce\r\ndown upon it as if you were in your own home! BERTHA. Oh, fie, have we ever been allowed in the conflict?

What can one believe in any more? Sometimes it strikes me that the old ways were better. As mothers we had\r\nan honored and respected position when in that way we fulfilled our\r\nduty as citizens; as housewives we were a great power, and to bring up\r\na family was not an ignominious occupation.

Think so? Can't I see that it is? Give me the brush and--[She\r\ntakes brush.]\r\n\r\nAXEL. No, let me alone. Aren't you ashamed? BERTHA. What's that? AXEL [Vexed]. Shame, I said.

Yes, when she is impudent to him. AXEL. That's right! Tear each other's eyes out! ABEL. Not at all! The whole thing is too insignificant for that. AXEL. Don't say that. Look here, Bertha, considering that our economic\r\ncondition is to undergo a change from now on, won't you be so good as to\r\nlet me see the account-book? BERTHA.

Yes, that tweak the salon disappointment gave him doesn't seem\r\nto have taken all the spunk out of him. Bertha, tell me, have you ever\r\nloved that clown? BERTHA. Loved him? I liked him very much because he was nice to me. But\r\nhe is so silly and--when he nags as he did just now, I feel that I could\r\nhate him. Think of it, it's already around that he painted my picture! ABEL. Well, if it's gone as far as that, then you must do something\r\neclatant. BERTHA. If I only knew how! ABEL. I'm usually inventive. Let me see. Look here, why couldn't you\r\nhave his refused picture brought home just as all your friends have\r\ngathered here? BERTHA. No, that would look as if I wanted to triumph. No, that would be\r\ntoo terrible. ABEL. Yes, but if I should have it done? Or Gaga, that would be better\r\nstill. It would be sent here in Axel's name by the porter. It's got to\r\ncome home anyway, and it's no secret that it was refused. BERTHA. No, but you know--\r\n\r\nABEL. What? Hasn't he spread false reports, and haven't you the right to\r\ndefend yourself? BERTHA. I would like it to happen very much, but I don't want to have\r\nanything to do with the doing of it. I want to be able to stand and\r\nswear that I am quite clean and innocent. ABEL. You shall be able to do so. I'll attend to it. BERTHA. What do you think he wanted the account-book for? He has never\r\nasked to see it before. Do you think he has some scheme in his head\r\nabout it? ABEL. Ye-es! Doubtless. He wants to see if you've accounted for the\r\nthree hundred francs you got for your picture. BERTHA. What picture? ABEL. The one you sold to Madame Roubey. BERTHA. How do you know about that? ABEL. The whole crowd knows about it. BERTHA. And Axel, too? ABEL. Yes. I happened to mention it because I thought he knew. It was\r\nstupid of you not to tell him. BERTHA. Does it concern him if I sell a--\r\n\r\nABEL. Yes, in a way, of course it concerns him. BERTHA. Well, then, I will explain that I didn't want to give him\r\nanother disappointment after he had already had the unhappiness of\r\nseeing me accepted at the salon.

That's not true; the luncheon only cost twelve francs. AXEL. That is to say, you put eight in your pocket. Then you have\r\nreceived three hundred francs for the picture that you sold. BERTHA. \"What a woman earns by her work, she also controls.\" That's what\r\nthe law states. AXEL. That's not a paradox, then? Not monomania? BERTHA. No, it seems not. AXEL. Of course, we must not be petty; you control your earnings, and\r\nhave controlled mine, in an unspeakable way; still, don't you think\r\nthat, as comrades, you should have told me about the sale? BERTHA. That didn't concern you. AXEL. It didn't concern me? Well, then it only remains for me to bring\r\nsuit for divorce. BERTHA. Divorce! Do you think I would stand the disgrace of being a\r\ndivorced wife? Do you think that I will allow myself to be driven from\r\nmy home, like a servant-maid who is sent away with her trunk? AXEL. I could throw you out into the street if I wished, but I shall\r\ndo a more humane thing and get the divorce on the grounds of\r\nincompatibility of temperament. BERTHA. If you can talk like that, you have never loved me! AXEL. Tell me, why do you think I asked for your hand? BERTHA. Because you wanted me to love you. AXEL. Oh, holy, revered, uncorruptible stupidity--yes! I could accuse\r\nyou of counterfeiting, for you have gone into debt to Willmer and made\r\nme responsible for the amount. BERTHA. Ah, the little insect! he has been talking, has he? AXEL. I just left him after paying him the three hundred and fifty\r\nfrancs for which you were indebted to him. But we mustn't be small about\r\nmoney matters, and we have more serious business to settle. You have\r\nallowed this scoundrel partially to pay for my household, and in doing\r\nso you have completely ruined my reputation. What have you done with the\r\nmoney? BERTHA. The whole thing is a lie. AXEL. Have you squandered it on luncheon and dinner parties? BERTHA. No, I have saved it; and that's something you have no conception\r\nof, spendthrift! AXEL.

A-ha, you think you can so easily get out of the duty that you\r\nmade yourself responsible for when you fooled me into becoming your\r\nwife? You shall see! AXEL. Now that I've had my eyes opened, the past is beginning to take on\r\nanother color. It seems to me almost as if you conjured that courtship\r\nof ours; it seems almost as if I had been the victim of what you women\r\ncall seduction; it now seems to me as if I had fallen into the hands of\r\nan adventuress, who lured my money away from me in a _hotel garni_; it\r\nseems almost as if I had lived in vice ever since I was united with you!

Look, there is the dress I was going to wear, that you wished\r\nto humiliate me with.

But now\r\nI am going to humble you, and since you were not willing to be my equal\r\nwhen I lowered myself to your level, you shall be my inferior, which you\r\nare. BERTHA. And all this--all this noble revenge because _you_ were _my_\r\ninferior! AXEL. Yes, I was your inferior, even when I painted your picture! BERTHA. Did you paint my picture?

That's your place, that you yourself have chosen. BERTHA [Giving in]. Axel, Axel, I don't know you any more. Are you he\r\nwho swore to love me, who begged to carry me, to lift me? AXEL. It is I.

[Bertha's attitude and actions are those of complete surrender.]\r\n\r\nAXEL. You see--I was your strength. When I took what was mine, you had\r\nnothing left. You were a rubber ball that I blew up; when I let go of\r\nyou, you fell together like an empty bag. BERTHA [Without looking up]. I don't know whether you are right or not,\r\nbut since we have quarreled, my strength has left me. Axel, will you\r\nbelieve me,--I have never experienced before what I now feel--\r\n\r\nAXEL. So?

Well, I'm an old family physician and my name is Anderson. Perhaps I may\r\nknow your names now?--Character not needed. MISS THERESE.

And\r\nimagine if she, my first love, my wife, with whom life the first time\r\nbecame life, had accepted your invitation and come here?

Yes, you have, and you were still human when Therese and Annette\r\ncautioned me. You and I have pulled this house through since mother\r\ndied. You have had to sit in the kitchen like Cinderella; I have had\r\nto take care of the service, the fires, sweep and clean, and do the\r\nerrands. You are tired; how should it be with me, then? ADELE. But you mustn't be tired. You have three daughters who are\r\nunprovided for and whose dowry you have wasted. DURAND [Listening without]. Doesn't it seem as if you heard the sound of\r\nclanging and rumbling down toward Cully? If fire has broken out they are\r\nlost, because the wind is going to blow soon, the lake tells me that. ADELE. Have you paid the fire insurance on our house? DURAND. Yes, I have. Otherwise I would never have got that last\r\nmortgage. ADELE. How much is there left unmortgaged? DURAND. A fifth of the fire insurance policy. But you know how property\r\ndropped in value when the railroad passed our gates and went to the east\r\ninstead. ADELE. So much the better. DURAND [Sternly]. Adele! [Pause.] Will you put out the fire in the\r\nstove? ADELE. Impossible. I can't till the coffee-bread comes. DURAND. Well, here it is. [Pierre comes in with basket. Adele looks in the basket.]\r\n\r\nADELE. No bread! But a bill--two, three--\r\n\r\nPIERRE.--Well, the baker said he wouldn't send any more bread until he\r\nwas paid. And then, when I was going by the butcher's and the grocer's,\r\nthey shoved these bills at me. [Goes out.]\r\n\r\nADELE. Oh, God in heaven, this is the end for us! But what's this? [Opens a package.]\r\n\r\nDURAND. Some candles that I bought for the mass for my dear little Rene. Today is the anniversary of his death. ADELE. You can afford to buy such things! DURAND. With my tips, yes. Don't you think it is humiliating to stretch\r\nout my hand whenever a traveller leaves us? Can't you grant me the only\r\ncontentment I possess--let me enjoy my sorrow one time each year? To be\r\nable to live in memory of the most beautiful thing life ever gave me? ADELE. If he had only lived until mow, you'd see how beautiful he'd be! DURAND. It's very possible that there's truth in your irony--as I\r\nremember him, however, he was not as you all are now. ADELE. Will you be good enough to receive Monsieur Antonio yourself? He is coming now to have his coffee _without_ bread! Oh, if mother were\r\nonly living! She always found a way when you stood helpless. DURAND. Your mother had her good qualities. ADELE. Although you saw only her faults. DURAND. Monsieur Antonio is coming. If you leave me now, I'll have a\r\ntalk with him.

It's needless to say how it pains me to have to tell you that on\r\naccount of insufficient supplies our house can no longer continue to do\r\nbusiness. ANTONIO. How is that? DURAND. To speak plainly, we are bankrupt. ANTONIO. But, my good Monsieur Durand, is there no way of helping you\r\nout of what I hope is just a temporary embarrassment? DURAND. No, there is no possible way out. The condition of the house has\r\nbeen so completely undermined for many years that I had rather the crash\r\nwould come than live in a state of anxiety day and night, expecting what\r\nmust come. ANTONIO. Nevertheless I believe you are looking at the dark side of\r\nthings. DURAND. I can't see what makes you doubt my statement. ANTONIO. Because I want to help you. DURAND. I don't wish any help. Privation must come and teach my children\r\nto lead a different life from this which is all play. With the exception\r\nof Adele, who really does take care of the kitchen, what do the others\r\ndo? Play, and sing, and promenade, and flirt; and as long as there is a\r\ncrust of bread in the house, they'll never do anything useful. ANTONIO. Granting that, but until the finances are straightened out we\r\nmust have bread in the house. Allow me to stay a month longer and I will\r\npay my bill in advance. DURAND. No, thank you, we must stick to this course even if it leads\r\nus into the lake! And I don't want to continue in this business, which\r\ndoesn't bring bread--nothing but humiliations. Just think how it was\r\nlast spring, when the house had been empty for three months. Then at\r\nlast an American family came and saved us. The morning after their\r\narrival I ran across the son catching hold of my daughter on the stairs. It was Therese,--he was trying to kiss her. What would you have done in\r\nmy case? ANTONIO [Confused]. I don't know--\r\n\r\nDURAND. I know what I, as a father, should have done,\r\nbut--father-like--I didn't do it. But I know what to do the next time. ANTONIO. On account of that very thing it seems to me that you should\r\nthink very carefully about what you do, and not leave your daughters to\r\nchance. DURAND. Monsieur Antonio, you are a young man who, for some inexplicable\r\nreason, has won my regard. Whether you grant it, or not, I am going to\r\nask one thing of you. Don't form any opinions about me as an individual,\r\nor about my conduct. ANTONIO. Monsieur Durand, I promise it if you will answer me one\r\nquestion; are you Swiss born, or not? DURAND. I am a Swiss citizen. ANTONIO. Yes, I know that, but I ask if you were born in Switzerland. DURAND [Uncertainly]. Yes. ANTONIO. I asked only--because it interested me. Nevertheless--as I must\r\nbelieve you that your pension must be closed, I want to pay what I owe. To be sure it's only ten francs, but I can't go away and leave an unpaid\r\nbill. DURAND. I can't be sure that this is really a debt, as I don't keep the\r\naccounts, but if you have deceived me you shall hear from me. Now I'll\r\ngo and get the bread. Afterward we'll find out. [Goes out.

THERESE [Takes matches away]. Well, at least you sha'n't waste the\r\nmatches. DURAND.

Well, all that was so long ago that I can't bother about it. For that matter, it was only your duty, as you have said yourself. DURAND. It was, and I fulfilled my duty and a little more too. ADELE. Well, continue to do so, or no one knows what will become of us. Three young girls left homeless and friendless, without anything to live\r\non! Do you know what want can drive one to? DURAND. That's what I said ten years ago, but no one would heed me; and\r\ntwenty years ago I predicted that this moment would come, and I haven't\r\nbeen able to prevent its coming. I have been sitting like a lone\r\nbrakeman on an express train, seeing it go toward an abyss, but I\r\nhaven't, been able to get to the engine valves to stop it. THERESE. And now you want thanks for landing in the abyss with us. DURAND. No, my child, I only ask that you be a little less unkind to me. You have cream fur the cat, but you begrudge milk to your father, who\r\nhas not eaten for--so long. THERESE. Oh, it's you, then, who has begrudged milk for my cat! DURAND. Yes, it's I. ANNETTE.

Now about another\r\nmatter. If Monsieur Durand passes out of the world as an [Whispers]\r\nincendiary, it doesn't matter much, but his children shall know that\r\nhe lived as a man of honor up to that time. Well, then, I was born in\r\nFrance, but I didn't have to admit that to the first scamp that came\r\nalong. Just before I reached the age of conscription I fell in love with\r\nthe one who later became my wife. To be able to marry, we came here and\r\nwere naturalized. When the last war broke out, and it looked as if I\r\nwas going to carry a weapon against my own country, I went out as a\r\nsharpshooter against the Germans. I never deserted, as you have heard\r\nthat I did--your mother invented that story. ADELE. Mother never lied--\r\n\r\nDURAND.--So, so. Now the ghost has risen and stands between us again. I\r\ncannot enter an action against the dead, but I swear I am speaking the\r\ntruth. Do you hear? And as far as your dowry is concerned, that is to\r\nsay your maternal inheritance, these are the facts: first, your mother\r\nthrough carelessness and foolish speculations ruined your paternal\r\ninheritance so completely that I had to give up my business and start\r\nthis pension. After that, part of her inheritance had to be used in the\r\nbringing-up of you children, which of course cannot be looked upon as\r\nthrown away. So it was also untrue that--\r\n\r\nADELE. No, that's not what mother said on her death-bed--\r\n\r\nDURAND.--Then your mother lied on her death-bed, just as she had done\r\nall through her life. And that's the curse that has been following me\r\nlike a spook. Think how you have innocently tortured me with these two\r\nlies for so many years! I didn't want to put disquiet into your young\r\nlives which would result in your doubting your mother's goodness. That's\r\nwhy I kept silent. I was the bearer of her cross throughout our married\r\nlife; carried all her faults on my back, took all the consequences of\r\nher mistakes on myself until at last I believed that I was the guilty\r\none. And she was not slow, first to believe herself to be blameless,\r\nand then later the victim. \"Blame it on me,\" I used to say, when she had\r\nbecome terribly involved in some tangle. And she blamed and I bore! But the more she became indebted to me, the more she hated me, with the\r\nlimitless hatred of her indebtedness. And in the end she despised me,\r\ntrying to strengthen herself by imagining she had deceived me. And last\r\nof all she taught you children to despise me, because she wanted support\r\nin her weakness. I hoped and believed that this evil but weak spirit\r\nwould die when she died; but evil lives and grows like disease, while\r\nsoundness stops at a certain point and then retrogrades. And when I\r\nwanted to change what was wrong in the habits of this household, I was\r\nalways met with \"But mother said,\" and therefore it was true; \"Mother\r\nused to do this way,\" and therefore it was right. And to you I became\r\na good-for-nothing when I was kind, a miserable creature when I was\r\nsensitive, and a scamp when I let you all have your way and ruin the\r\nhouse. ADELE. It's honorable to accuse the dead who can't defend themselves! DURAND [Fast and exalted]. I am not dead yet, but I will be soon.

No, I could hardly pardon what the law does not, and\r\nI must confess that it would be hard for me to accuse a collector for\r\ntaking an antique that he did not have in his collection, which he had\r\ndug up on some one else's property.

Sit down now and let's have a talk, as you are off again\r\ntomorrow.--It's queer that, although I became intimate with you so soon,\r\nyou are one of those people whose likeness I cannot recall when they are\r\nout of my sight. When you are out in the fields and I try to recall your\r\nface, another acquaintance always comes to mind--some one who doesn't\r\nreally look like you, but whom you resemble nevertheless. MR. Y. Who is that? MR. X. I won't mention the name. However, I used to have dinner at the\r\nsame place for many years, and there at the lunch counter I met a little\r\nblond man with pale, worried eyes. He had an extraordinary faculty\r\nof getting about in a crowded room without shoving or being shoved. Standing at the door, he could reach a slice of bread two yards away; he\r\nalways looked as if he was happy to be among people, and whenever he ran\r\ninto an acquaintance he would fall into rapturous laughter, embrace him,\r\nand do the figure eight around him, and carry on as if he hadn't met a\r\nhuman being for years; if any one stepped on his toes he would smile as\r\nif he were asking pardon for being in the way. For two years I used to\r\nsee him, and I used to amuse myself trying to figure out his business\r\nand character, but I never asked any one who he was,--I didn't want to\r\nknow, as that would have put an end to my amusement. That man had the\r\nsame indefinable characteristics as you; sometimes I would make him out\r\nan undergraduate teacher, an under officer, a druggist, a government\r\nclerk, or a detective, and like you, he seemed to be made up of two\r\ndifferent pieces and the front didn't fit the back. One day I happened\r\nto read in the paper about a big forgery by a well-known civil official. After that I found out that my indefinable acquaintance had been the\r\ncompanion of the forger's brother, and that his name was Straman; and\r\nthen I was informed that the afore-mentioned Straman had been connected\r\nwith a free library, but that he was then a police reporter on a big\r\nnewspaper. How could I then get any connection between the forgery, the\r\npolice, and the indefinable man's appearance? I don't know, but when I\r\nasked a man if Straman had ever been convicted, he answered neither yes\r\nnor no--he didn't know. [Pause.]\r\n\r\nMR. Y. Well, was he ever--convicted? MR.

You haven't sent a letter since you've been here. Just one postal-card, and that you wrote with a blue pencil. Do you\r\nsee now how I have figured out your mis-step? Furthermore, this is the\r\nseventh time that you have refused to go to Malmoe, where you have not\r\ngone since you have been here. Nevertheless you came here from America\r\njust to see Malmoe; and every morning you have walked southward three\r\nmiles and a half to the windmill hill just to see the roofs of Malmoe;\r\nalso, when you stand at the right-hand window, through the third\r\nwindow-pane to the left, counting from the bottom up, you can see the\r\nturrets of the castle, and the chimneys on the _state prison_. Do you\r\nsee now that it is not that I am so clever but that you are so stupid? MR. Y. Now you hate me. MR. X. No. MR. Y. Yes, you do, you must. MR. X. No--see, here's my hand. MR. Y. [Kisses the proffered hand]. MR. X. [Drawing back his hand]. What dog's trick is that? MR. Y. Pardon! But thou art the first to offer me his hand after\r\nknowing--\r\n\r\nMR.

Will you tell me how\r\nit happened? Will you? MR. Y. [Dubiously]. Yes, but you won't believe what I say. I'm going to\r\ntell you, though, and you shall see that I was not a common criminal.

This man can\r\nwipe out the stain he has unwittingly brought upon himself only through\r\nscientific achievement; but for the attainment of this he must have\r\nmoney--much money, and that immediately.

MR. Y. Well, we understand each other.--H'm! How much do you consider\r\nlegitimate? MR. X. Legitimate? The law decrees that a man's life is worth at the\r\nminimum fifty crowns. But as the deceased had no relatives, there's\r\nnothing to be said on that score. MR. Y. Humph, you will not understand? Then I must speak more plainly. It is to me that you are to pay the fine. MR. X. I've never heard that a homicide should pay a fine to a forger,\r\nand there is also no accuser. MR. Y. No? Yes, you have me. MR. X. Ah, now things are beginning to clear up.

[Mr. Y. points to the\r\ncase.] I don't want to do that, I don't want to become a thief. MR. Y. Don't pretend. Do you want me to believe that you haven't dipped\r\ninto that case before now? MR. X. [As to himself]. To think that I could make such a big mistake! But that's the way it always is with bland people. One is fond of gentle\r\npeople, and then one believes so easily that he is liked; and just on\r\naccount of that I have been a little watchful of those of whom I've been\r\nfond. So you are fully convinced that I have helped myself from that\r\ncase? MR. Y. Yes, I'm sure of it. MR. X. And you will accuse me if you do not receive the six thousand\r\ncrowns? MR. Y. Absolutely. You can't get out of it, so it's not worth while\r\ntrying to do so. MR. X. Do you think I would give my father a thief for son, my wife a\r\nthief for husband, my children a thief for father, and my confreres a\r\nthief for comrade? That shall never happen. Now I'll go to the sheriff\r\nand give myself up. MR. Y. [Springs up and gets his things together]. Wait a moment. MR. X. What for? M$. Y. [Stammering]. I only thought--that as I'm not needed--I wouldn't\r\nneed to be present--and could go. MR. X. You cannot. Sit down at your place at the table, where you've\r\nbeen sitting, and we will talk a little. MR. Y. [Sits, after putting on a dark coat]. What's going to happen now? MR. X. [Looking into mirror]. Now everything is clear to me! Ah! MR. Y. [Worried]. What do you see now that's so remarkable? MR. X. I see in the mirror that you are a thief, a simple, common thief. Just now, when you sat there in your shirt-sleeves, I noticed that\r\nsomething was wrong about my book-shelf, but I couldn't make out what it\r\nwas, as I wanted to listen to you and observe you. Now, since you have\r\nbecome my antagonist, my sight is keener, and since you have put on that\r\nblack coat, that acts as a color contrast against the red backs of the\r\nbooks, which were not noticeable before against your red suspenders, I\r\nsee that you have been there and read your forgery story in Bernheim's\r\nessay on hypnotic suggestion, and returned the book upside down.

ELIS [Looks around]. The double windows are off, the floor scoured,\r\nfresh curtains at the windows--yes, it is spring again! The ice has\r\ngone out of the river, and the willows are beginning to bud on the\r\nbanks--yes, spring has come and I can put away my winter overcoat. [Weighs his overcoat in his hand and hangs it up.] You know, it's so\r\nheavy--just as tho' it had absorbed the weight of the whole winter's\r\nworries, the sweat and dust of the school-room. CHRISTINE. But you have a vacation now. ELIS. Yes, Easter. Five days to enjoy, to breathe, to forget. [Takes\r\nChristine's hand a minute, and then seats himself in arm-chair.] Yes,\r\nthe sun has come again. It left us in November. How well I remember\r\nthe day it disappeared behind the brewery across the street. Oh, this\r\nwinter, this long winter. CHRISTINE [With a gesture toward kitchen]. Sh! Sh! ELIS. I'll be quiet--But I'm so happy that it's over with. Oh, the warm\r\nsun! [Rubs his hands as tho' bathing them in the sunshine.] I want to\r\nbathe in the sunshine and light after all the winter gloom--\r\n\r\nCHRISTINE. Sh! Sh! ELIS. Do you know, I believe that good luck is coming our way--that hard\r\nluck is tired of us. CHRISTINE. What makes you think so? ELIS. Why, as I was going by the cathedral just now a white dove flew\r\ndown and alighted in front of me, and dropped a little branch it was\r\ncarrying right at my feet. CHRISTINE. Did you notice what kind of branch it was? ELIS. Of course it couldn't have been an olive branch, but I believe it\r\nwas a sign of peace--and I felt the life-giving joy of spring. Where's\r\nmother? CHRISTINE [Points toward kitchen]. In the kitchen. ELIS [Quietly and closing his eyes]. I hear the spring! I can tell that\r\nthe double windows are off, I hear the wheel hubs so plainly. And what's\r\nthat?--a robin chirping out in the orchard, and they are hammering down\r\nat the docks and I can smell the fresh paint on the steamers. CHRISTINE. Can you feel all that--here in town? ELIS. Here? It's true we are _here_, but I was up there, in the North,\r\nwhere our home lies. Oh, how did we ever get into this dreadful city\r\nwhere the people all hate each other and where one is always alone? Yes,\r\nit was our daily bread that led the way, but with the bread came the\r\nmisfortunes: father's criminal act and little sister's illness. Tell me,\r\ndo you know whether mother has ever been to see father since he's been\r\nin prison? CHRISTINE. Why, I think she's been there this very day. ELIS. What did she have to say about it?

[Takes out the check book.] You see the money is\r\nalready in the bank, and when school is over we will start for the\r\nNorth, for our home land among the lakes. The cottage stands there just\r\nas it did when we were children, and the linden trees. Oh, that it were\r\nsummer already and I could go swimming in the lake! I feel as if this\r\nfamily dishonor has besmirched me so that I long to bathe, body and\r\nsoul, in the clear lake waters. CHRISTINE. Have you heard anything from Eleonora? ELIS. Yes--poor little sister! She writes me letters that tear my heart\r\nto pieces. She wants to get out of the asylum--and home, of course. But\r\nthe doctor daren't let her go. She would do things that might lead\r\nto prison, he says. Do you know, I feel terribly conscience-stricken\r\nsometimes--\r\n\r\nCHRISTINE [Starting]. Why? ELIS. Because I agreed with all the rest of them that it was best to put\r\nher there. CHRISTINE. My dear, you are always accusing yourself. It was fortunate\r\nshe could be taken care of like that--poor little thing! ELIS. Well, perhaps you're right. It is best so. She is as well off\r\nthere as she could be anywhere. When I think of how she used to go about\r\nhere casting gloom over every attempt at happiness, how her fate weighed\r\nus down like a nightmare, then I am tempted to feel almost glad about\r\nit. I believe the greatest misfortune that could happen would be to see\r\nher cross this threshold. Selfish brute that I am! CHRISTINE. Human being that you are! ELIS. And yet--I suffer--suffer at the thought of her misery and my\r\nfather's. CHRISTINE. It seems as tho' some were born to suffer. ELIS. You poor Christine--to be drawn into this family, which was cursed\r\nfrom the beginning! Yes, doomed! CHRISTINE. You don't know whether it's all trial or punishment, Elis. Perhaps I can help you through the struggles. ELIS. Do you think mother has a clean dress tie for me? CHRISTINE [Anxiously]. Are you going out? ELIS. I'm going out to dinner. Peter won the debate last night, you\r\nknow, and he's giving a dinner tonight. CHRISTINE. And you're going to that dinner? ELIS. You mean that perhaps I shouldn't because he has proven such an\r\nunfaithful friend and pupil? CHRISTINE. I can't deny that I was shocked by his unfaithfulness, when\r\nhe promised to quote from your theories and he simply plundered them\r\nwithout giving you any credit. ELIS. Ah, that's the way things go, but I am happy in the consciousness\r\nthat \"this have I done.\"\r\n\r\nCHRISTINE. Has he invited you to the dinner? ELIS. Why, that's true--come to think of it, he didn't invite me. That's\r\nvery strange. Why didn't I think of that before! Why, he's been talking\r\nfor years as though I were to be the guest of honor at that dinner, and\r\nhe has told others that. But if I am not invited--then of course it's\r\npretty plain that I'm snubbed, insulted, in fact. Well, it doesn't\r\nmatter. It isn't the first time--nor the last. [Pause.]\r\n\r\nCHRISTINE.

Would you like to hear more? Or shall I tell you something\r\nabout flowers?

Well, now I see farther than others, and I can see the stars\r\nin the daylight! BENJAMIN. But the stars are not up there then, are they? ELEONORA. How funny you are! The stars are always up there--and now,\r\nas I sit facing the west, I can see Cassiopea like a W up there in the\r\nmiddle of the Milky Way. Can you see it? BENJAMIN. No, indeed I can't see it. ELEONORA. Let me call your attention to this, that some can see that\r\nwhich others do not do not be too sure of your own eyes therefore! Now\r\nI'm going to tell you about that flower standing on the table: it is an\r\nEaster lily whose home is in Switzerland; it has a calyx which drinks\r\nsunlight, therefore it is yellow and can soothe pain. When I was passing\r\na florist's, just now, I saw it and wanted to make a present of it to\r\nbrother Elis. When I tried to go into the shop I found the door was\r\nlocked--because it is confirmation day. But I must have the flower--I\r\ntook out my keys and tried them--can you believe it, my door key worked! I went in. You know that flowers speak silently! Every fragrance uttered\r\na multitude of thoughts, and those thoughts reached me: and with my\r\nmagnifying eyes I looked into the flowers' workrooms, which no one else\r\nhas ever seen. And they told me about their sorrows which the careless\r\nflorist causes them--mark you, I did not say cruel, for he is only\r\nthoughtless. Then I put a coin on the desk with my card, took the Easter\r\nlily and went out. BENJAMIN. How thoughtless! Think if the flower is missed and the money\r\nisn't found? ELEONORA. That's true! You are right. BENJAMIN. A coin can easily disappear, and if they find your card it's\r\nall up with you. ELEONORA. But no one would believe that I wanted to take anything. BENJAMIN [Looking hard at her]. They wouldn't? ELEONORA [Rising]. Ah! I know what you mean! Like father, like child! How thoughtless I have been! Ah! That which must be, must be! [Sits.] It\r\nmust be so. BENJAMIN. Couldn't we say that--\r\n\r\nELEONORA. Hush! Let's talk of other things! Poor Elis! Poor all of\r\nus! But it is Easter, and we ought to suffer. Isn't there a recital\r\ntomorrow? [Benjamin nods his head.] And they give Haydn's Seven Words on\r\nthe Cross! \"Mother, behold thy son!\" [She weeps with face in hands.]\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN. What kind of illness have you had? ELEONORA. An illness that is not mortal unless it is God's will! I\r\nexpected good, and evil came; I expected light, and darkness came. How\r\nwas your childhood, Benjamin? BENJAMIN. Oh, I don't know. Kind of tiresome! And yours? ELEONORA. I never had any. I was born old. I knew everything when I was\r\nborn, and when I was taught anything it was only like remembering. I\r\nknew human weaknesses when I was four years old, and that's why people\r\nwere horrid to me. BENJAMIN. Do you know, I, too, seem to have thought everything that you\r\nsay. ELEONORA. I am sure you have. What made you think that the coin I left\r\nat the florist's would be lost? BENJAMIN.

Yes, but they had some visiting pastor, and I didn't like\r\nhim, he mumbled his words so. ELIS. Did you meet any one you knew? MRS. HEYST. Yes, more is the pity. ELIS. Then I know whom--\r\n\r\nMRS. HEYST. Yes, Lindkvist. And he came up to me and--\r\n\r\nELIS. Oh, how terrible, how terrible--\r\n\r\nMRS. HEYST. He asked how things were going--and imagine my fright--he\r\nasked if he might come and see us this evening. ELIS. On a holy day? MRS. HEYST. I was speechless--and he, I am afraid, mistook my silence\r\nfor consent. So he may be here any moment. ELIS [Rises]. Here? MRS. HEYST. He said he wished to leave a paper of some sort which was\r\nimportant. ELIS. A warrant! He wants to take our furniture. MRS. HEYST. But he looked so queer. I didn't quite understand him. ELIS.

And if Lina would only return--[Pause.] Oh, I heard\r\nsomething about the dinner Peter gave last night. What do you think--the\r\nGovernor himself was there. ELIS. The Governor at Peter's--? I'm astonished. Peter has always avowed\r\nhimself against the Governor's party. MRS. HEYST. He must have changed then. ELIS. He wasn't called Peter for nothing, it seems. MRS. HEYST. But what have _you_ got against the Governor? ELIS.

No, no, they must not\r\ntake you. I shall defend you, Eleonora. ELEONORA. That's very beautiful, Benjamin, but you mustn't do that. BENJAMIN [Looking thro' curtain]. There are two of them.

Do you think that God would be angry, when I didn't do any\r\nharm, only acted thoughtlessly? It served me right--I shouldn't have\r\ndoubted. BENJAMIN. But tomorrow that man will come and take the things. ELEONORA. Let him come. Then we'll go out under the sky, away from\r\neverything--away from all the old home things that father gathered for\r\nus, that I have seen since I was a child.

And those papers--if\r\nI could only burn them! They are filled with meanness, falsehood and\r\nrevenge. Therefore, my child, you must keep away from evil and unclean\r\nthings, both with your lips and heart. BENJAMIN. How you understand everything! ELEONORA. Do you know something else that I feel? If Elis and Christine\r\nget to know that I bought the Easter lily in that unusual way, they\r\nwill--\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN. What will they do? ELEONORA. They will send me back--_there_. Where I just came from. Where\r\nthe sun never shines. Where the walls are dark and bare. Where one hears\r\nonly crying and lamentation. Where I sat away a year of my life. BENJAMIN.

I felt like his accomplice when he went down--for,\r\nin a way, I knew of the crime, and if the judge hadn't been a man of\r\ngreat feeling, who realized my position as a wife and mother, I too\r\nwould have been punished. ELIS. What was really the cause of father's fall? I have never been able\r\nto understand. MRS. HEYST. Pride--pride. Which brings us all down. ELIS.

MRS. HEYST. They say that suspicion leads in a certain direction--it's\r\npretty plain where. ELIS. I must talk to her. MRS. HEYST. Don't speak harshly to her. I can stand no more. Oh, she is\r\nlost--regained but lost again! Speak kindly to her. [She goes out R.]\r\n\r\nELIS [At door L.]. Oh,--[Calls] Eleonora, come out here. I want to speak\r\nto you.

And I can put\r\nthe seals on, too, if I choose--but I don't, not yet. [Looks around the\r\nroom.]\r\n\r\nELIS. As you please; the things are at your disposal. LINDKVIST.

You\r\nplundered no one--but if you resent being plundered, then you cannot\r\nstay in this town, as no one would speak to the terrible creature who\r\nwants his own hard-earned money returned.\" So you see there exists a\r\ngrace which is finer than justice, and that is mercy. ELIS. You are right. Take everything. It belongs to you. LINDKVIST. I have right on my side, but I dare not use it. ELIS. I shall think of your children and not complain. LINDKVIST. Good. Then I'll put the blue paper away again.--And now we'll\r\ngo a step further. ELIS. Pardon me, but do they intend to accuse my mother? LINDKVIST.

No. LINDKVIST. But the Governor\r\n\r\nELIS. Let us change the subject. LINDKVIST. You must speak courteously to me, as I am defenseless.

It's about forty years since I came to this town, as a boy,\r\nyou understand--alone, unknown, without even one acquaintance, to seek\r\na position. All I owned was one silver dollar. The night that I arrived\r\nwas a dark, rainy one. As I didn't know of any cheap hotel, I asked\r\nthe passers-by about one, but no one stopped to answer. Took me for a\r\nbeggar, most likely. When I was at the height of my despair, a young man\r\ncame up and asked me why I was crying--evidently I was crying.--I told\r\nhim my need, and he turned from his course and took me to a hotel, and\r\ncomforted me with friendly words. As I entered the hotel the glass door\r\nof a store next door was thrown open and hit my elbow and was smashed\r\nto pieces. The furious owner of the store grabbed me and insisted that I\r\nshould pay for it, or else he would call the police. Can you imagine my\r\ndespair? The kindly-intentioned unknown man, who was a witness of\r\nthe affair, protested, and went to the trouble of calling the police\r\nhimself, explained, and saved me from a night in the street. This man\r\nwas your father! So you see, \"As ye sow, so shall ye reap.\" And for\r\nyour father's sake, I have foregone what is owed me. Therefore take\r\nthis paper and keep your check. [Rises.] And as you find it hard to say\r\nthanks, I'll go immediately, and especially as I find it painful to be\r\nthanked.

PART I\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the little town of Vevey, in Switzerland, there is a particularly\r\ncomfortable hotel. There are, indeed, many hotels, for the entertainment\r\nof tourists is the business of the place, which, as many travelers will\r\nremember, is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake--a lake that\r\nit behooves every tourist to visit. The shore of the lake presents an\r\nunbroken array of establishments of this order, of every category, from\r\nthe “grand hotel” of the newest fashion, with a chalk-white front, a\r\nhundred balconies, and a dozen flags flying from its roof, to the little\r\nSwiss pension of an elder day, with its name inscribed in German-looking\r\nlettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the\r\nangle of the garden. One of the hotels at Vevey, however, is famous,\r\neven classical, being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors\r\nby an air both of luxury and of maturity. In this region, in the month\r\nof June, American travelers are extremely numerous; it may be said,\r\nindeed, that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics\r\nof an American watering place. There are sights and sounds which evoke a\r\nvision, an echo, of Newport and Saratoga. There is a flitting hither\r\nand thither of “stylish” young girls, a rustling of muslin flounces,\r\na rattle of dance music in the morning hours, a sound of high-pitched\r\nvoices at all times. You receive an impression of these things at the\r\nexcellent inn of the “Trois Couronnes” and are transported in fancy to\r\nthe Ocean House or to Congress Hall. But at the “Trois Couronnes,” it\r\nmust be added, there are other features that are much at variance with\r\nthese suggestions: neat German waiters, who look like secretaries of\r\nlegation; Russian princesses sitting in the garden; little Polish boys\r\nwalking about held by the hand, with their governors; a view of the\r\nsunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle\r\nof Chillon. I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were\r\nuppermost in the mind of a young American, who, two or three years ago,\r\nsat in the garden of the “Trois Couronnes,” looking about him, rather\r\nidly, at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned. It was a\r\nbeautiful summer morning, and in whatever fashion the young American\r\nlooked at things, they must have seemed to him charming. He had come\r\nfrom Geneva the day before by the little steamer, to see his aunt, who\r\nwas staying at the hotel--Geneva having been for a long time his place\r\nof residence. But his aunt had a headache--his aunt had almost always a\r\nheadache--and now she was shut up in her room, smelling camphor, so that\r\nhe was at liberty to wander about. He was some seven-and-twenty years\r\nof age; when his friends spoke of him, they usually said that he was at\r\nGeneva “studying.” When his enemies spoke of him, they said--but,\r\nafter all, he had no enemies; he was an extremely amiable fellow, and\r\nuniversally liked. What I should say is, simply, that when certain\r\npersons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so\r\nmuch time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who\r\nlived there--a foreign lady--a person older than himself. Very few\r\nAmericans--indeed, I think none--had ever seen this lady, about whom\r\nthere were some singular stories. But Winterbourne had an old attachment\r\nfor the little metropolis of Calvinism; he had been put to school there\r\nas a boy, and he had afterward gone to college there--circumstances\r\nwhich had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships.

At last\r\nhe finished his coffee and lit a cigarette. Presently a small boy came\r\nwalking along the path--an urchin of nine or ten. The child, who was\r\ndiminutive for his years, had an aged expression of countenance, a pale\r\ncomplexion, and sharp little features. He was dressed in knickerbockers,\r\nwith red stockings, which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks;\r\nhe also wore a brilliant red cravat.

Winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor\r\nof claiming him as a fellow countryman. “Take care you don’t hurt your\r\nteeth,” he said, paternally. “I haven’t got any teeth to hurt. They have all come out. I have only\r\ngot seven teeth. My mother counted them last night, and one came out\r\nright afterward. She said she’d slap me if any more came out. I can’t\r\nhelp it. It’s this old Europe. It’s the climate that makes them come\r\nout. In America they didn’t come out. It’s these hotels.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was much amused. “If you eat three lumps of sugar, your\r\nmother will certainly slap you,” he said. “She’s got to give me some candy, then,” rejoined his young\r\ninterlocutor. “I can’t get any candy here--any American candy. American\r\ncandy’s the best candy.”\r\n\r\n“And are American little boys the best little boys?” asked Winterbourne. “I don’t know. I’m an American boy,” said the child. “I see you are one of the best!” laughed Winterbourne. “Are you an American man?” pursued this vivacious infant. And then,\r\non Winterbourne’s affirmative reply--“American men are the best,” he\r\ndeclared. His companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had\r\nnow got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he\r\nattacked a second lump of sugar. Winterbourne wondered if he himself\r\nhad been like this in his infancy, for he had been brought to Europe at\r\nabout this age. “Here comes my sister!” cried the child in a moment. “She’s an American\r\ngirl.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady\r\nadvancing. “American girls are the best girls,” he said cheerfully to\r\nhis young companion. “My sister ain’t the best!” the child declared. “She’s always blowing at\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“I imagine that is your fault, not hers,” said Winterbourne. The young\r\nlady meanwhile had drawn near. She was dressed in white muslin, with a\r\nhundred frills and flounces, and knots of pale-colored ribbon. She was\r\nbareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep\r\nborder of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty. “How\r\npretty they are!” thought Winterbourne, straightening himself in his\r\nseat, as if he were prepared to rise.

The young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight\r\nat her brother. “Well, I guess you had better be quiet,” she simply\r\nobserved. It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented. He\r\ngot up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his\r\ncigarette. “This little boy and I have made acquaintance,” he said, with\r\ngreat civility. In Geneva, as he had been perfectly aware, a young\r\nman was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under\r\ncertain rarely occurring conditions; but here at Vevey, what conditions\r\ncould be better than these?--a pretty American girl coming and standing\r\nin front of you in a garden. This pretty American girl, however, on\r\nhearing Winterbourne’s observation, simply glanced at him; she then\r\nturned her head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the\r\nopposite mountains. He wondered whether he had gone too far, but he\r\ndecided that he must advance farther, rather than retreat. While he was\r\nthinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little\r\nboy again. “I should like to know where you got that pole,” she said. “I bought it,” responded Randolph. “You don’t mean to say you’re going to take it to Italy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am going to take it to Italy,” the child declared. The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a\r\nknot or two of ribbon. Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again. “Well, I guess you had better leave it somewhere,” she said after a\r\nmoment. “Are you going to Italy?” Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great\r\nrespect. The young lady glanced at him again. “Yes, sir,” she replied. And she\r\nsaid nothing more. “Are you--a--going over the Simplon?” Winterbourne pursued, a little\r\nembarrassed. “I don’t know,” she said. “I suppose it’s some mountain. Randolph, what\r\nmountain are we going over?”\r\n\r\n“Going where?” the child demanded. “To Italy,” Winterbourne explained. “I don’t know,” said Randolph. “I don’t want to go to Italy. I want to\r\ngo to America.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Italy is a beautiful place!” rejoined the young man. “Can you get candy there?” Randolph loudly inquired. “I hope not,” said his sister. “I guess you have had enough candy, and\r\nmother thinks so too.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!” cried the\r\nboy, still jumping about. The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again;\r\nand Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the\r\nview. He was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he had begun to perceive\r\nthat she was not in the least embarrassed herself. There had not been\r\nthe slightest alteration in her charming complexion; she was evidently\r\nneither offended nor flattered. If she looked another way when he spoke\r\nto her, and seemed not particularly to hear him, this was simply her\r\nhabit, her manner. Yet, as he talked a little more and pointed out some\r\nof the objects of interest in the view, with which she appeared quite\r\nunacquainted, she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance;\r\nand then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking. It was not, however, what would have been called an immodest glance,\r\nfor the young girl’s eyes were singularly honest and fresh. They were\r\nwonderfully pretty eyes; and, indeed, Winterbourne had not seen for\r\na long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman’s various\r\nfeatures--her complexion, her nose, her ears, her teeth.", "sentences": ["The little boy had now converted his\r\nalpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he was springing\r\nabout in the gravel and kicking it up not a little.", "“Randolph,” said the young lady, “what ARE you doing?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going up the Alps,” replied Randolph.", "“This is the way!” And he\r\ngave another little jump, scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne’s\r\nears.", "“That’s the way they come down,” said Winterbourne.", "“He’s an American man!” cried Randolph, in his little hard voice.", "The young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight\r\nat her brother.", "“Well, I guess you had better be quiet,” she simply\r\nobserved.", "It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented.", "He\r\ngot up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his\r\ncigarette.", "“This little boy and I have made acquaintance,” he said, with\r\ngreat civility.", "In Geneva, as he had been perfectly aware, a young\r\nman was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under\r\ncertain rarely occurring conditions; but here at Vevey, what conditions\r\ncould be better than these?--a pretty American girl coming and standing\r\nin front of you in a garden.", "This pretty American girl, however, on\r\nhearing Winterbourne’s observation, simply glanced at him; she then\r\nturned her head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the\r\nopposite mountains.", "He wondered whether he had gone too far, but he\r\ndecided that he must advance farther, rather than retreat.", "While he was\r\nthinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little\r\nboy again.", "“I should like to know where you got that pole,” she said.", "“I bought it,” responded Randolph.", "“You don’t mean to say you’re going to take it to Italy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am going to take it to Italy,” the child declared.", "The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a\r\nknot or two of ribbon.", "Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again.", "“Well, I guess you had better leave it somewhere,” she said after a\r\nmoment.", "“Are you going to Italy?” Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great\r\nrespect.", "The young lady glanced at him again.", "“Yes, sir,” she replied.", "And she\r\nsaid nothing more.", "“Are you--a--going over the Simplon?” Winterbourne pursued, a little\r\nembarrassed.", "“I don’t know,” she said.", "“I suppose it’s some mountain.", "Randolph, what\r\nmountain are we going over?”\r\n\r\n“Going where?” the child demanded.", "“To Italy,” Winterbourne explained.", "“I don’t know,” said Randolph.", "“I don’t want to go to Italy.", "I want to\r\ngo to America.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Italy is a beautiful place!” rejoined the young man.", "“Can you get candy there?” Randolph loudly inquired.", "“I hope not,” said his sister.", "“I guess you have had enough candy, and\r\nmother thinks so too.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!” cried the\r\nboy, still jumping about.", "The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again;\r\nand Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the\r\nview.", "He was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he had begun to perceive\r\nthat she was not in the least embarrassed herself.", "There had not been\r\nthe slightest alteration in her charming complexion; she was evidently\r\nneither offended nor flattered.", "If she looked another way when he spoke\r\nto her, and seemed not particularly to hear him, this was simply her\r\nhabit, her manner.", "Yet, as he talked a little more and pointed out some\r\nof the objects of interest in the view, with which she appeared quite\r\nunacquainted, she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance;\r\nand then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking.", "It was not, however, what would have been called an immodest glance,\r\nfor the young girl’s eyes were singularly honest and fresh.", "They were\r\nwonderfully pretty eyes; and, indeed, Winterbourne had not seen for\r\na long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman’s various\r\nfeatures--her complexion, her nose, her ears, her teeth."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Henry James"}, {"id": "txt_it_208_4", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Daisy Miller: A Study (Part 4)", "language": "it", "content": "He had a great\r\nrelish for feminine beauty; he was addicted to observing and analyzing\r\nit; and as regards this young lady’s face he made several observations. It was not at all insipid, but it was not exactly expressive; and\r\nthough it was eminently delicate, Winterbourne mentally accused it--very\r\nforgivingly--of a want of finish. He thought it very possible that\r\nMaster Randolph’s sister was a coquette; he was sure she had a spirit of\r\nher own; but in her bright, sweet, superficial little visage there was\r\nno mockery, no irony. Before long it became obvious that she was much\r\ndisposed toward conversation. She told him that they were going to Rome\r\nfor the winter--she and her mother and Randolph. She asked him if he was\r\na “real American”; she shouldn’t have taken him for one; he seemed more\r\nlike a German--this was said after a little hesitation--especially when\r\nhe spoke. Winterbourne, laughing, answered that he had met Germans who\r\nspoke like Americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met\r\nan American who spoke like a German. Then he asked her if she should not\r\nbe more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted. She answered that she liked standing up and walking about; but she\r\npresently sat down. She told him she was from New York State--“if you\r\nknow where that is.” Winterbourne learned more about her by catching\r\nhold of her small, slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes\r\nby his side. “Tell me your name, my boy,” he said. “Randolph C. Miller,” said the boy sharply. “And I’ll tell you her\r\nname;” and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister. “You had better wait till you are asked!” said this young lady calmly. “I should like very much to know your name,” said Winterbourne. “Her name is Daisy Miller!” cried the child. “But that isn’t her real\r\nname; that isn’t her name on her cards.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity you haven’t got one of my cards!” said Miss Miller. “Her real name is Annie P. Miller,” the boy went on. “Ask him HIS name,” said his sister, indicating Winterbourne. But on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to\r\nsupply information with regard to his own family. “My father’s name is\r\nEzra B. Miller,” he announced. “My father ain’t in Europe; my father’s\r\nin a better place than Europe.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the\r\nchild had been taught to intimate that Mr. Miller had been removed to\r\nthe sphere of celestial reward. But Randolph immediately added, “My\r\nfather’s in Schenectady. He’s got a big business. My father’s rich, you\r\nbet!”\r\n\r\n“Well!” ejaculated Miss Miller, lowering her parasol and looking at\r\nthe embroidered border. Winterbourne presently released the child,\r\nwho departed, dragging his alpenstock along the path. “He doesn’t like\r\nEurope,” said the young girl. “He wants to go back.”\r\n\r\n“To Schenectady, you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he wants to go right home. He hasn’t got any boys here. There is\r\none boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they won’t let\r\nhim play.”\r\n\r\n“And your brother hasn’t any teacher?” Winterbourne inquired. “Mother thought of getting him one, to travel round with us. There was a\r\nlady told her of a very good teacher; an American lady--perhaps you know\r\nher--Mrs. Sanders. I think she came from Boston. She told her of this\r\nteacher, and we thought of getting him to travel round with us. But\r\nRandolph said he didn’t want a teacher traveling round with us. He said\r\nhe wouldn’t have lessons when he was in the cars. And we ARE in the cars\r\nabout half the time. There was an English lady we met in the cars--I\r\nthink her name was Miss Featherstone; perhaps you know her. She wanted\r\nto know why I didn’t give Randolph lessons--give him ‘instruction,’ she\r\ncalled it. I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give\r\nhim. He’s very smart.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Winterbourne; “he seems very smart.”\r\n\r\n“Mother’s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy.", "sentences": ["He had a great\r\nrelish for feminine beauty; he was addicted to observing and analyzing\r\nit; and as regards this young lady’s face he made several observations.", "It was not at all insipid, but it was not exactly expressive; and\r\nthough it was eminently delicate, Winterbourne mentally accused it--very\r\nforgivingly--of a want of finish.", "He thought it very possible that\r\nMaster Randolph’s sister was a coquette; he was sure she had a spirit of\r\nher own; but in her bright, sweet, superficial little visage there was\r\nno mockery, no irony.", "Before long it became obvious that she was much\r\ndisposed toward conversation.", "She told him that they were going to Rome\r\nfor the winter--she and her mother and Randolph.", "She asked him if he was\r\na “real American”; she shouldn’t have taken him for one; he seemed more\r\nlike a German--this was said after a little hesitation--especially when\r\nhe spoke.", "Winterbourne, laughing, answered that he had met Germans who\r\nspoke like Americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met\r\nan American who spoke like a German.", "Then he asked her if she should not\r\nbe more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted.", "She answered that she liked standing up and walking about; but she\r\npresently sat down.", "She told him she was from New York State--“if you\r\nknow where that is.” Winterbourne learned more about her by catching\r\nhold of her small, slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes\r\nby his side.", "“Tell me your name, my boy,” he said.", "“Randolph C.", "Miller,” said the boy sharply.", "“And I’ll tell you her\r\nname;” and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister.", "“You had better wait till you are asked!” said this young lady calmly.", "“I should like very much to know your name,” said Winterbourne.", "“Her name is Daisy Miller!” cried the child.", "“But that isn’t her real\r\nname; that isn’t her name on her cards.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity you haven’t got one of my cards!” said Miss Miller.", "“Her real name is Annie P.", "Miller,” the boy went on.", "“Ask him HIS name,” said his sister, indicating Winterbourne.", "But on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to\r\nsupply information with regard to his own family.", "“My father’s name is\r\nEzra B.", "Miller,” he announced.", "“My father ain’t in Europe; my father’s\r\nin a better place than Europe.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the\r\nchild had been taught to intimate that Mr.", "Miller had been removed to\r\nthe sphere of celestial reward.", "But Randolph immediately added, “My\r\nfather’s in Schenectady.", "He’s got a big business.", "My father’s rich, you\r\nbet!”\r\n\r\n“Well!” ejaculated Miss Miller, lowering her parasol and looking at\r\nthe embroidered border.", "Winterbourne presently released the child,\r\nwho departed, dragging his alpenstock along the path.", "“He doesn’t like\r\nEurope,” said the young girl.", "“He wants to go back.”\r\n\r\n“To Schenectady, you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he wants to go right home.", "He hasn’t got any boys here.", "There is\r\none boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they won’t let\r\nhim play.”\r\n\r\n“And your brother hasn’t any teacher?” Winterbourne inquired.", "“Mother thought of getting him one, to travel round with us.", "There was a\r\nlady told her of a very good teacher; an American lady--perhaps you know\r\nher--Mrs.", "Sanders.", "I think she came from Boston.", "She told her of this\r\nteacher, and we thought of getting him to travel round with us.", "But\r\nRandolph said he didn’t want a teacher traveling round with us.", "He said\r\nhe wouldn’t have lessons when he was in the cars.", "And we ARE in the cars\r\nabout half the time.", "There was an English lady we met in the cars--I\r\nthink her name was Miss Featherstone; perhaps you know her.", "She wanted\r\nto know why I didn’t give Randolph lessons--give him ‘instruction,’ she\r\ncalled it.", "I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give\r\nhim.", "He’s very smart.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Winterbourne; “he seems very smart.”\r\n\r\n“Mother’s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Henry James"}, {"id": "txt_it_208_5", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Daisy Miller: A Study (Part 5)", "language": "it", "content": "Can\r\nyou get good teachers in Italy?”\r\n\r\n“Very good, I should think,” said Winterbourne. “Or else she’s going to find some school. He ought to learn some more. He’s only nine. He’s going to college.” And in this way Miss Miller\r\ncontinued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other\r\ntopics. She sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with\r\nvery brilliant rings, folded in her lap, and with her pretty eyes now\r\nresting upon those of Winterbourne, now wandering over the garden, the\r\npeople who passed by, and the beautiful view. She talked to Winterbourne\r\nas if she had known him a long time. He found it very pleasant. It was\r\nmany years since he had heard a young girl talk so much. It might have\r\nbeen said of this unknown young lady, who had come and sat down beside\r\nhim upon a bench, that she chattered. She was very quiet; she sat in a\r\ncharming, tranquil attitude; but her lips and her eyes were constantly\r\nmoving. She had a soft, slender, agreeable voice, and her tone was\r\ndecidedly sociable. She gave Winterbourne a history of her movements\r\nand intentions and those of her mother and brother, in Europe, and\r\nenumerated, in particular, the various hotels at which they had stopped. “That English lady in the cars,” she said--“Miss Featherstone--asked me\r\nif we didn’t all live in hotels in America. I told her I had never been\r\nin so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe. I have never\r\nseen so many--it’s nothing but hotels.” But Miss Miller did not make\r\nthis remark with a querulous accent; she appeared to be in the best\r\nhumor with everything. She declared that the hotels were very good, when\r\nonce you got used to their ways, and that Europe was perfectly sweet. She was not disappointed--not a bit. Perhaps it was because she had\r\nheard so much about it before. She had ever so many intimate friends\r\nthat had been there ever so many times. And then she had had ever so\r\nmany dresses and things from Paris. Whenever she put on a Paris dress\r\nshe felt as if she were in Europe. “It was a kind of a wishing cap,” said Winterbourne. “Yes,” said Miss Miller without examining this analogy; “it always made\r\nme wish I was here. But I needn’t have done that for dresses. I am sure\r\nthey send all the pretty ones to America; you see the most frightful\r\nthings here. The only thing I don’t like,” she proceeded, “is the\r\nsociety. There isn’t any society; or, if there is, I don’t know where it\r\nkeeps itself. Do you? I suppose there is some society somewhere, but I\r\nhaven’t seen anything of it. I’m very fond of society, and I have always\r\nhad a great deal of it. I don’t mean only in Schenectady, but in New\r\nYork. I used to go to New York every winter. In New York I had lots of\r\nsociety. Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me; and three of them\r\nwere by gentlemen,” added Daisy Miller. “I have more friends in New York\r\nthan in Schenectady--more gentleman friends; and more young lady friends\r\ntoo,” she resumed in a moment. She paused again for an instant; she was\r\nlooking at Winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and\r\nin her light, slightly monotonous smile. “I have always had,” she said,\r\n“a great deal of gentlemen’s society.”\r\n\r\nPoor Winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. He\r\nhad never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion;\r\nnever, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of\r\ndemonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment. And yet was he\r\nto accuse Miss Daisy Miller of actual or potential inconduite, as they\r\nsaid at Geneva? He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he\r\nhad lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the American tone. Never, indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had\r\nhe encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this. Certainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! Was she\r\nsimply a pretty girl from New York State?", "sentences": ["Can\r\nyou get good teachers in Italy?”\r\n\r\n“Very good, I should think,” said Winterbourne.", "“Or else she’s going to find some school.", "He ought to learn some more.", "He’s only nine.", "He’s going to college.” And in this way Miss Miller\r\ncontinued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other\r\ntopics.", "She sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with\r\nvery brilliant rings, folded in her lap, and with her pretty eyes now\r\nresting upon those of Winterbourne, now wandering over the garden, the\r\npeople who passed by, and the beautiful view.", "She talked to Winterbourne\r\nas if she had known him a long time.", "He found it very pleasant.", "It was\r\nmany years since he had heard a young girl talk so much.", "It might have\r\nbeen said of this unknown young lady, who had come and sat down beside\r\nhim upon a bench, that she chattered.", "She was very quiet; she sat in a\r\ncharming, tranquil attitude; but her lips and her eyes were constantly\r\nmoving.", "She had a soft, slender, agreeable voice, and her tone was\r\ndecidedly sociable.", "She gave Winterbourne a history of her movements\r\nand intentions and those of her mother and brother, in Europe, and\r\nenumerated, in particular, the various hotels at which they had stopped.", "“That English lady in the cars,” she said--“Miss Featherstone--asked me\r\nif we didn’t all live in hotels in America.", "I told her I had never been\r\nin so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe.", "I have never\r\nseen so many--it’s nothing but hotels.” But Miss Miller did not make\r\nthis remark with a querulous accent; she appeared to be in the best\r\nhumor with everything.", "She declared that the hotels were very good, when\r\nonce you got used to their ways, and that Europe was perfectly sweet.", "She was not disappointed--not a bit.", "Perhaps it was because she had\r\nheard so much about it before.", "She had ever so many intimate friends\r\nthat had been there ever so many times.", "And then she had had ever so\r\nmany dresses and things from Paris.", "Whenever she put on a Paris dress\r\nshe felt as if she were in Europe.", "“It was a kind of a wishing cap,” said Winterbourne.", "“Yes,” said Miss Miller without examining this analogy; “it always made\r\nme wish I was here.", "But I needn’t have done that for dresses.", "I am sure\r\nthey send all the pretty ones to America; you see the most frightful\r\nthings here.", "The only thing I don’t like,” she proceeded, “is the\r\nsociety.", "There isn’t any society; or, if there is, I don’t know where it\r\nkeeps itself.", "Do you?", "I suppose there is some society somewhere, but I\r\nhaven’t seen anything of it.", "I’m very fond of society, and I have always\r\nhad a great deal of it.", "I don’t mean only in Schenectady, but in New\r\nYork.", "I used to go to New York every winter.", "In New York I had lots of\r\nsociety.", "Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me; and three of them\r\nwere by gentlemen,” added Daisy Miller.", "“I have more friends in New York\r\nthan in Schenectady--more gentleman friends; and more young lady friends\r\ntoo,” she resumed in a moment.", "She paused again for an instant; she was\r\nlooking at Winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and\r\nin her light, slightly monotonous smile.", "“I have always had,” she said,\r\n“a great deal of gentlemen’s society.”\r\n\r\nPoor Winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed.", "He\r\nhad never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion;\r\nnever, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of\r\ndemonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment.", "And yet was he\r\nto accuse Miss Daisy Miller of actual or potential inconduite, as they\r\nsaid at Geneva?", "He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he\r\nhad lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the American tone.", "Never, indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had\r\nhe encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this.", "Certainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable!", "Was she\r\nsimply a pretty girl from New York State?"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Henry James"}, {"id": "txt_it_208_6", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Daisy Miller: A Study (Part 6)", "language": "it", "content": "Were they all like that, the\r\npretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen’s society? Or was she also\r\na designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? Winterbourne\r\nhad lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him. Miss Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent. Some people had told him\r\nthat, after all, American girls were exceedingly innocent; and others\r\nhad told him that, after all, they were not. He was inclined to think\r\nMiss Daisy Miller was a flirt--a pretty American flirt. He had never, as\r\nyet, had any relations with young ladies of this category. He had\r\nknown, here in Europe, two or three women--persons older than Miss Daisy\r\nMiller, and provided, for respectability’s sake, with husbands--who were\r\ngreat coquettes--dangerous, terrible women, with whom one’s relations\r\nwere liable to take a serious turn. But this young girl was not a\r\ncoquette in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a\r\npretty American flirt. Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found\r\nthe formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller. He leaned back in his\r\nseat; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had\r\never seen; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations\r\nof one’s intercourse with a pretty American flirt. It presently became\r\napparent that he was on the way to learn. “Have you been to that old castle?” asked the young girl, pointing with\r\nher parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon. “Yes, formerly, more than once,” said Winterbourne. “You too, I suppose,\r\nhave seen it?”\r\n\r\n“No; we haven’t been there. I want to go there dreadfully. Of course I\r\nmean to go there. I wouldn’t go away from here without having seen that\r\nold castle.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a very pretty excursion,” said Winterbourne, “and very easy to\r\nmake. You can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer.”\r\n\r\n“You can go in the cars,” said Miss Miller. “Yes; you can go in the cars,” Winterbourne assented. “Our courier says they take you right up to the castle,” the young girl\r\ncontinued. “We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers\r\ndreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn’t go. Randolph wouldn’t\r\ngo either; he says he doesn’t think much of old castles. But I guess\r\nwe’ll go this week, if we can get Randolph.”\r\n\r\n“Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments?” Winterbourne\r\ninquired, smiling. “He says he don’t care much about old castles. He’s only nine. He\r\nwants to stay at the hotel. Mother’s afraid to leave him alone, and the\r\ncourier won’t stay with him; so we haven’t been to many places. But it\r\nwill be too bad if we don’t go up there.” And Miss Miller pointed again\r\nat the Chateau de Chillon. “I should think it might be arranged,” said Winterbourne. “Couldn’t you\r\nget some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph?”\r\n\r\nMiss Miller looked at him a moment, and then, very placidly, “I wish YOU\r\nwould stay with him!” she said. Winterbourne hesitated a moment. “I should much rather go to Chillon\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“With me?” asked the young girl with the same placidity. She didn’t rise, blushing, as a young girl at Geneva would have done;\r\nand yet Winterbourne, conscious that he had been very bold, thought\r\nit possible she was offended. “With your mother,” he answered very\r\nrespectfully. But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss\r\nDaisy Miller. “I guess my mother won’t go, after all,” she said. “She\r\ndon’t like to ride round in the afternoon. But did you really mean what\r\nyou said just now--that you would like to go up there?”\r\n\r\n“Most earnestly,” Winterbourne declared. “Then we may arrange it. If mother will stay with Randolph, I guess\r\nEugenio will.”\r\n\r\n“Eugenio?” the young man inquired. “Eugenio’s our courier. He doesn’t like to stay with Randolph; he’s the\r\nmost fastidious man I ever saw. But he’s a splendid courier.", "sentences": ["Were they all like that, the\r\npretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen’s society?", "Or was she also\r\na designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person?", "Winterbourne\r\nhad lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him.", "Miss Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent.", "Some people had told him\r\nthat, after all, American girls were exceedingly innocent; and others\r\nhad told him that, after all, they were not.", "He was inclined to think\r\nMiss Daisy Miller was a flirt--a pretty American flirt.", "He had never, as\r\nyet, had any relations with young ladies of this category.", "He had\r\nknown, here in Europe, two or three women--persons older than Miss Daisy\r\nMiller, and provided, for respectability’s sake, with husbands--who were\r\ngreat coquettes--dangerous, terrible women, with whom one’s relations\r\nwere liable to take a serious turn.", "But this young girl was not a\r\ncoquette in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a\r\npretty American flirt.", "Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found\r\nthe formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller.", "He leaned back in his\r\nseat; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had\r\never seen; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations\r\nof one’s intercourse with a pretty American flirt.", "It presently became\r\napparent that he was on the way to learn.", "“Have you been to that old castle?” asked the young girl, pointing with\r\nher parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon.", "“Yes, formerly, more than once,” said Winterbourne.", "“You too, I suppose,\r\nhave seen it?”\r\n\r\n“No; we haven’t been there.", "I want to go there dreadfully.", "Of course I\r\nmean to go there.", "I wouldn’t go away from here without having seen that\r\nold castle.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a very pretty excursion,” said Winterbourne, “and very easy to\r\nmake.", "You can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer.”\r\n\r\n“You can go in the cars,” said Miss Miller.", "“Yes; you can go in the cars,” Winterbourne assented.", "“Our courier says they take you right up to the castle,” the young girl\r\ncontinued.", "“We were going last week, but my mother gave out.", "She suffers\r\ndreadfully from dyspepsia.", "She said she couldn’t go.", "Randolph wouldn’t\r\ngo either; he says he doesn’t think much of old castles.", "But I guess\r\nwe’ll go this week, if we can get Randolph.”\r\n\r\n“Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments?” Winterbourne\r\ninquired, smiling.", "“He says he don’t care much about old castles.", "He’s only nine.", "He\r\nwants to stay at the hotel.", "Mother’s afraid to leave him alone, and the\r\ncourier won’t stay with him; so we haven’t been to many places.", "But it\r\nwill be too bad if we don’t go up there.” And Miss Miller pointed again\r\nat the Chateau de Chillon.", "“I should think it might be arranged,” said Winterbourne.", "“Couldn’t you\r\nget some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph?”\r\n\r\nMiss Miller looked at him a moment, and then, very placidly, “I wish YOU\r\nwould stay with him!” she said.", "Winterbourne hesitated a moment.", "“I should much rather go to Chillon\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“With me?” asked the young girl with the same placidity.", "She didn’t rise, blushing, as a young girl at Geneva would have done;\r\nand yet Winterbourne, conscious that he had been very bold, thought\r\nit possible she was offended.", "“With your mother,” he answered very\r\nrespectfully.", "But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss\r\nDaisy Miller.", "“I guess my mother won’t go, after all,” she said.", "“She\r\ndon’t like to ride round in the afternoon.", "But did you really mean what\r\nyou said just now--that you would like to go up there?”\r\n\r\n“Most earnestly,” Winterbourne declared.", "“Then we may arrange it.", "If mother will stay with Randolph, I guess\r\nEugenio will.”\r\n\r\n“Eugenio?” the young man inquired.", "“Eugenio’s our courier.", "He doesn’t like to stay with Randolph; he’s the\r\nmost fastidious man I ever saw.", "But he’s a splendid courier."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Henry James"}, {"id": "txt_it_208_7", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Daisy Miller: A Study (Part 7)", "language": "it", "content": "I guess\r\nhe’ll stay at home with Randolph if mother does, and then we can go to\r\nthe castle.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible--“we” could\r\nonly mean Miss Daisy Miller and himself. This program seemed almost too\r\nagreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young lady’s\r\nhand. Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but\r\nat this moment another person, presumably Eugenio, appeared. A tall,\r\nhandsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and\r\na brilliant watch chain, approached Miss Miller, looking sharply at her\r\ncompanion. “Oh, Eugenio!” said Miss Miller with the friendliest accent. Eugenio had looked at Winterbourne from head to foot; he now bowed\r\ngravely to the young lady. “I have the honor to inform mademoiselle that\r\nluncheon is upon the table.”\r\n\r\nMiss Miller slowly rose. “See here, Eugenio!” she said; “I’m going to\r\nthat old castle, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“To the Chateau de Chillon, mademoiselle?” the courier inquired. “Mademoiselle has made arrangements?” he added in a tone which struck\r\nWinterbourne as very impertinent. Eugenio’s tone apparently threw, even to Miss Miller’s own apprehension,\r\na slightly ironical light upon the young girl’s situation. She turned\r\nto Winterbourne, blushing a little--a very little. “You won’t back out?”\r\n she said. “I shall not be happy till we go!” he protested. “And you are staying in this hotel?” she went on. “And you are really an\r\nAmerican?”\r\n\r\nThe courier stood looking at Winterbourne offensively. The young man,\r\nat least, thought his manner of looking an offense to Miss Miller; it\r\nconveyed an imputation that she “picked up” acquaintances. “I shall have\r\nthe honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me,”\r\n he said, smiling and referring to his aunt. “Oh, well, we’ll go some day,” said Miss Miller. And she gave him a\r\nsmile and turned away. She put up her parasol and walked back to the inn\r\nbeside Eugenio. Winterbourne stood looking after her; and as she moved\r\naway, drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that\r\nshe had the tournure of a princess. He had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising\r\nto present his aunt, Mrs. Costello, to Miss Daisy Miller. As soon as the\r\nformer lady had got better of her headache, he waited upon her in her\r\napartment; and, after the proper inquiries in regard to her health, he\r\nasked her if she had observed in the hotel an American family--a mamma,\r\na daughter, and a little boy. “And a courier?” said Mrs. Costello. “Oh yes, I have observed them. Seen\r\nthem--heard them--and kept out of their way.” Mrs. Costello was a widow\r\nwith a fortune; a person of much distinction, who frequently intimated\r\nthat, if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches, she would\r\nprobably have left a deeper impress upon her time. She had a long, pale\r\nface, a high nose, and a great deal of very striking white hair, which\r\nshe wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head. She had\r\ntwo sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe. This\r\nyoung man was amusing himself at Hamburg, and, though he was on his\r\ntravels, was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment\r\nselected by his mother for her own appearance there. Her nephew, who had\r\ncome up to Vevey expressly to see her, was therefore more attentive than\r\nthose who, as she said, were nearer to her.

I am an old woman, but I am not too old, thank\r\nHeaven, to be shocked!”\r\n\r\n“But don’t they all do these things--the young girls in America?”\r\n Winterbourne inquired. Mrs. Costello stared a moment. “I should like to see my granddaughters\r\ndo them!” she declared grimly. This seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for Winterbourne\r\nremembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in New York were\r\n“tremendous flirts.” If, therefore, Miss Daisy Miller exceeded the\r\nliberal margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that\r\nanything might be expected of her. Winterbourne was impatient to see her\r\nagain, and he was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he should not\r\nappreciate her justly. Though he was impatient to see her, he hardly knew what he should say\r\nto her about his aunt’s refusal to become acquainted with her; but he\r\ndiscovered, promptly enough, that with Miss Daisy Miller there was\r\nno great need of walking on tiptoe. He found her that evening in the\r\ngarden, wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph,\r\nand swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld. It was ten\r\no’clock. He had dined with his aunt, had been sitting with her since\r\ndinner, and had just taken leave of her till the morrow. Miss Daisy\r\nMiller seemed very glad to see him; she declared it was the longest\r\nevening she had ever passed. “Have you been all alone?” he asked. “I have been walking round with mother. But mother gets tired walking\r\nround,” she answered. “Has she gone to bed?”\r\n\r\n“No; she doesn’t like to go to bed,” said the young girl. “She doesn’t\r\nsleep--not three hours. She says she doesn’t know how she lives. She’s\r\ndreadfully nervous. I guess she sleeps more than she thinks. She’s gone\r\nsomewhere after Randolph; she wants to try to get him to go to bed. He\r\ndoesn’t like to go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hope she will persuade him,” observed Winterbourne. “She will talk to him all she can; but he doesn’t like her to talk\r\nto him,” said Miss Daisy, opening her fan. “She’s going to try to get\r\nEugenio to talk to him. But he isn’t afraid of Eugenio. Eugenio’s a\r\nsplendid courier, but he can’t make much impression on Randolph! I don’t\r\nbelieve he’ll go to bed before eleven.” It appeared that Randolph’s\r\nvigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged, for Winterbourne strolled\r\nabout with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother. “I\r\nhave been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to,” his\r\ncompanion resumed. “She’s your aunt.” Then, on Winterbourne’s admitting\r\nthe fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it, she\r\nsaid she had heard all about Mrs. Costello from the chambermaid. She was\r\nvery quiet and very comme il faut; she wore white puffs; she spoke to no\r\none, and she never dined at the table d’hote. Every two days she had a\r\nheadache. “I think that’s a lovely description, headache and all!” said\r\nMiss Daisy, chattering along in her thin, gay voice. “I want to know her\r\never so much. I know just what YOUR aunt would be; I know I should like\r\nher. She would be very exclusive. I like a lady to be exclusive; I’m\r\ndying to be exclusive myself. Well, we ARE exclusive, mother and I. We\r\ndon’t speak to everyone--or they don’t speak to us. I suppose it’s about\r\nthe same thing. Anyway, I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was embarrassed. “She would be most happy,” he said; “but I\r\nam afraid those headaches will interfere.”\r\n\r\nThe young girl looked at him through the dusk. “But I suppose she\r\ndoesn’t have a headache every day,” she said sympathetically. Winterbourne was silent a moment. “She tells me she does,” he answered\r\nat last, not knowing what to say. Miss Daisy Miller stopped and stood looking at him. Her prettiness was\r\nstill visible in the darkness; she was opening and closing her enormous\r\nfan. “She doesn’t want to know me!” she said suddenly. “Why don’t you\r\nsay so?", "sentences": ["Costello, “I must decline the honor\r\nof her acquaintance.", "I am an old woman, but I am not too old, thank\r\nHeaven, to be shocked!”\r\n\r\n“But don’t they all do these things--the young girls in America?”\r\n Winterbourne inquired.", "Mrs.", "Costello stared a moment.", "“I should like to see my granddaughters\r\ndo them!” she declared grimly.", "This seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for Winterbourne\r\nremembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in New York were\r\n“tremendous flirts.” If, therefore, Miss Daisy Miller exceeded the\r\nliberal margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that\r\nanything might be expected of her.", "Winterbourne was impatient to see her\r\nagain, and he was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he should not\r\nappreciate her justly.", "Though he was impatient to see her, he hardly knew what he should say\r\nto her about his aunt’s refusal to become acquainted with her; but he\r\ndiscovered, promptly enough, that with Miss Daisy Miller there was\r\nno great need of walking on tiptoe.", "He found her that evening in the\r\ngarden, wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph,\r\nand swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld.", "It was ten\r\no’clock.", "He had dined with his aunt, had been sitting with her since\r\ndinner, and had just taken leave of her till the morrow.", "Miss Daisy\r\nMiller seemed very glad to see him; she declared it was the longest\r\nevening she had ever passed.", "“Have you been all alone?” he asked.", "“I have been walking round with mother.", "But mother gets tired walking\r\nround,” she answered.", "“Has she gone to bed?”\r\n\r\n“No; she doesn’t like to go to bed,” said the young girl.", "“She doesn’t\r\nsleep--not three hours.", "She says she doesn’t know how she lives.", "She’s\r\ndreadfully nervous.", "I guess she sleeps more than she thinks.", "She’s gone\r\nsomewhere after Randolph; she wants to try to get him to go to bed.", "He\r\ndoesn’t like to go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hope she will persuade him,” observed Winterbourne.", "“She will talk to him all she can; but he doesn’t like her to talk\r\nto him,” said Miss Daisy, opening her fan.", "“She’s going to try to get\r\nEugenio to talk to him.", "But he isn’t afraid of Eugenio.", "Eugenio’s a\r\nsplendid courier, but he can’t make much impression on Randolph!", "I don’t\r\nbelieve he’ll go to bed before eleven.” It appeared that Randolph’s\r\nvigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged, for Winterbourne strolled\r\nabout with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother.", "“I\r\nhave been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to,” his\r\ncompanion resumed.", "“She’s your aunt.” Then, on Winterbourne’s admitting\r\nthe fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it, she\r\nsaid she had heard all about Mrs.", "Costello from the chambermaid.", "She was\r\nvery quiet and very comme il faut; she wore white puffs; she spoke to no\r\none, and she never dined at the table d’hote.", "Every two days she had a\r\nheadache.", "“I think that’s a lovely description, headache and all!” said\r\nMiss Daisy, chattering along in her thin, gay voice.", "“I want to know her\r\never so much.", "I know just what YOUR aunt would be; I know I should like\r\nher.", "She would be very exclusive.", "I like a lady to be exclusive; I’m\r\ndying to be exclusive myself.", "Well, we ARE exclusive, mother and I.", "We\r\ndon’t speak to everyone--or they don’t speak to us.", "I suppose it’s about\r\nthe same thing.", "Anyway, I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was embarrassed.", "“She would be most happy,” he said; “but I\r\nam afraid those headaches will interfere.”\r\n\r\nThe young girl looked at him through the dusk.", "“But I suppose she\r\ndoesn’t have a headache every day,” she said sympathetically.", "Winterbourne was silent a moment.", "“She tells me she does,” he answered\r\nat last, not knowing what to say.", "Miss Daisy Miller stopped and stood looking at him.", "Her prettiness was\r\nstill visible in the darkness; she was opening and closing her enormous\r\nfan.", "“She doesn’t want to know me!” she said suddenly.", "“Why don’t you\r\nsay so?"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Henry James"}, {"id": "txt_it_208_10", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Daisy Miller: A Study (Part 10)", "language": "it", "content": "You needn’t be afraid. I’m not afraid!” And she gave a little\r\nlaugh. Winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched,\r\nshocked, mortified by it. “My dear young lady,” he protested, “she knows\r\nno one. It’s her wretched health.”\r\n\r\nThe young girl walked on a few steps, laughing still. “You needn’t be\r\nafraid,” she repeated. “Why should she want to know me?” Then she paused\r\nagain; she was close to the parapet of the garden, and in front of her\r\nwas the starlit lake. There was a vague sheen upon its surface, and in\r\nthe distance were dimly seen mountain forms. Daisy Miller looked out\r\nupon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh. “Gracious! she IS exclusive!” she said. Winterbourne wondered whether\r\nshe was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense\r\nof injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to\r\nreassure and comfort her. He had a pleasant sense that she would be very\r\napproachable for consolatory purposes. He felt then, for the instant,\r\nquite ready to sacrifice his aunt, conversationally; to admit that she\r\nwas a proud, rude woman, and to declare that they needn’t mind her. But before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture\r\nof gallantry and impiety, the young lady, resuming her walk, gave an\r\nexclamation in quite another tone. “Well, here’s Mother! I guess she\r\nhasn’t got Randolph to go to bed.” The figure of a lady appeared at a\r\ndistance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and\r\nwavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to pause. “Are you sure it is your mother? Can you distinguish her in this thick\r\ndusk?” Winterbourne asked. “Well!” cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh; “I guess I know my own\r\nmother. And when she has got on my shawl, too! She is always wearing my\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nThe lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot\r\nat which she had checked her steps. “I am afraid your mother doesn’t see you,” said Winterbourne. “Or perhaps,” he added, thinking, with Miss Miller, the joke\r\npermissible--“perhaps she feels guilty about your shawl.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s a fearful old thing!” the young girl replied serenely. “I told\r\nher she could wear it. She won’t come here because she sees you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then,” said Winterbourne, “I had better leave you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; come on!” urged Miss Daisy Miller. “I’m afraid your mother doesn’t approve of my walking with you.”\r\n\r\nMiss Miller gave him a serious glance. “It isn’t for me; it’s for\r\nyou--that is, it’s for HER. Well, I don’t know who it’s for! But mother\r\ndoesn’t like any of my gentlemen friends. She’s right down timid. She\r\nalways makes a fuss if I introduce a gentleman. But I DO introduce\r\nthem--almost always. If I didn’t introduce my gentlemen friends to\r\nMother,” the young girl added in her little soft, flat monotone, “I\r\nshouldn’t think I was natural.”\r\n\r\n“To introduce me,” said Winterbourne, “you must know my name.” And he\r\nproceeded to pronounce it. “Oh, dear, I can’t say all that!” said his companion with a laugh. But\r\nby this time they had come up to Mrs. Miller, who, as they drew near,\r\nwalked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently\r\nat the lake and turning her back to them. “Mother!” said the young\r\ngirl in a tone of decision. Upon this the elder lady turned round. “Mr. Winterbourne,” said Miss Daisy Miller, introducing the young man very\r\nfrankly and prettily. “Common,” she was, as Mrs. Costello had pronounced\r\nher; yet it was a wonder to Winterbourne that, with her commonness, she\r\nhad a singularly delicate grace. Her mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye,\r\na very exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain\r\namount of thin, much frizzled hair. Like her daughter, Mrs. Miller was\r\ndressed with extreme elegance; she had enormous diamonds in her ears. So far as Winterbourne could observe, she gave him no greeting--she\r\ncertainly was not looking at him.", "sentences": ["You needn’t be afraid.", "I’m not afraid!” And she gave a little\r\nlaugh.", "Winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice;

to admit that she\r\nwas a proud, rude woman, and to declare that they needn’t mind her.", "But before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture\r\nof gallantry and impiety, the young lady, resuming her walk, gave an\r\nexclamation in quite another tone.", "“Well, here’s Mother!", "I guess she\r\nhasn’t got Randolph to go to bed.” The figure of a lady appeared at a\r\ndistance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and\r\nwavering movement.", "Suddenly it seemed to pause.", "“Are you sure it is your mother?", "Can you distinguish her in this thick\r\ndusk?” Winterbourne asked.", "“Well!” cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh; “I guess I know my own\r\nmother.", "And when she has got on my shawl, too!", "She is always wearing my\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nThe lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot\r\nat which she had checked her steps.", "“I am afraid your mother doesn’t see you,” said Winterbourne.", "“Or perhaps,” he added, thinking, with Miss Miller, the joke\r\npermissible--“perhaps she feels guilty about your shawl.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s a fearful old thing!” the young girl replied serenely.", "“I told\r\nher she could wear it.", "She won’t come here because she sees you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then,” said Winterbourne, “I had better leave you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no;

I couldn’t induce him,” said Mrs. Miller very gently. “He wants to\r\ntalk to the waiter. He likes to talk to that waiter.”\r\n\r\n“I was telling Mr. Winterbourne,” the young girl went on; and to the\r\nyoung man’s ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering\r\nhis name all her life. “Oh, yes!” said Winterbourne; “I have the pleasure of knowing your son.”\r\n\r\nRandolph’s mamma was silent; she turned her attention to the lake.

Winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of\r\nthe projected excursion; but he said to himself that she was a simple,\r\neasily managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would\r\ntake the edge from her displeasure. “Yes,” he began; “your daughter has\r\nkindly allowed me the honor of being her guide.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Miller’s wandering eyes attached themselves, with a sort of\r\nappealing air, to Daisy, who, however, strolled a few steps farther,\r\ngently humming to herself. “I presume you will go in the cars,” said her\r\nmother. “Yes, or in the boat,” said Winterbourne. “Well, of course, I don’t know,” Mrs. Miller rejoined. “I have never\r\nbeen to that castle.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pity you shouldn’t go,” said Winterbourne, beginning to feel\r\nreassured as to her opposition. And yet he was quite prepared to find\r\nthat, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter. “We’ve been thinking ever so much about going,” she pursued; “but it\r\nseems as if we couldn’t.

We visited several in England,”\r\n she presently added. “Ah yes! in England there are beautiful castles,” said Winterbourne. “But Chillon here, is very well worth seeing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if Daisy feels up to it--” said Mrs. Miller, in a tone\r\nimpregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise. “It seems\r\nas if there was nothing she wouldn’t undertake.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think she’ll enjoy it!” Winterbourne declared.

Then--“I guess she had better go alone,” she said simply. Winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of\r\nmaternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the\r\nforefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of\r\nthe lake. But his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very\r\ndistinctly pronounced by Mrs. Miller’s unprotected daughter. “Mr. Winterbourne!” murmured Daisy. “Mademoiselle!” said the young man. “Don’t you want to take me out in a boat?”\r\n\r\n“At present?” he asked. “Of course!” said Daisy. “Well, Annie Miller!” exclaimed her mother. “I beg you, madam, to let her go,” said Winterbourne ardently; for\r\nhe had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer\r\nstarlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl. “I shouldn’t think she’d want to,” said her mother. “I should think\r\nshe’d rather go indoors.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure Mr. Winterbourne wants to take me,” Daisy declared. “He’s so\r\nawfully devoted!”\r\n\r\n“I will row you over to Chillon in the starlight.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it!” said Daisy. “Well!” ejaculated the elder lady again. “You haven’t spoken to me for half an hour,” her daughter went on. “I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother,”\r\n said Winterbourne. “Well, I want you to take me out in a boat!” Daisy repeated. They had\r\nall stopped, and she had turned round and was looking at Winterbourne. Her face wore a charming smile, her pretty eyes were gleaming, she was\r\nswinging her great fan about. No; it’s impossible to be prettier than\r\nthat, thought Winterbourne. “There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place,” he said,\r\npointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake. “If you will do me the honor to accept my arm, we will go and select one\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\nDaisy stood there smiling; she threw back her head and gave a little,\r\nlight laugh. “I like a gentleman to be formal!” she declared. “I assure you it’s a formal offer.”\r\n\r\n“I was bound I would make you say something,” Daisy went on. “You see, it’s not very difficult,” said Winterbourne. “But I am afraid\r\nyou are chaffing me.”\r\n\r\n“I think not, sir,” remarked Mrs. Miller very gently. “Do, then, let me give you a row,” he said to the young girl. “It’s quite lovely, the way you say that!” cried Daisy. “It will be still more lovely to do it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it would be lovely!” said Daisy. But she made no movement to\r\naccompany him; she only stood there laughing. “I should think you had better find out what time it is,” interposed her\r\nmother. “It is eleven o’clock, madam,” said a voice, with a foreign accent, out\r\nof the neighboring darkness; and Winterbourne, turning, perceived the\r\nflorid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. He had\r\napparently just approached. “Oh, Eugenio,” said Daisy, “I am going out in a boat!”\r\n\r\nEugenio bowed. “At eleven o’clock, mademoiselle?”\r\n\r\n“I am going with Mr. Winterbourne--this very minute.”\r\n\r\n“Do tell her she can’t,” said Mrs. Miller to the courier. “I think you had better not go out in a boat, mademoiselle,” Eugenio\r\ndeclared. Winterbourne wished to Heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with\r\nher courier; but he said nothing. “I suppose you don’t think it’s proper!” Daisy exclaimed. “Eugenio\r\ndoesn’t think anything’s proper.”\r\n\r\n“I am at your service,” said Winterbourne. “Does mademoiselle propose to go alone?” asked Eugenio of Mrs. Miller. “Oh, no; with this gentleman!” answered Daisy’s mamma. The courier looked for a moment at Winterbourne--the latter thought he\r\nwas smiling--and then, solemnly, with a bow, “As mademoiselle pleases!”\r\n he said. “Oh, I hoped you would make a fuss!” said Daisy. “I don’t care to go\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“I myself shall make a fuss if you don’t go,” said Winterbourne.", "sentences": ["“You are not disposed, madam,” he\r\ninquired, “to undertake it yourself?”\r\n\r\nDaisy’s mother looked at him an instant askance, and then walked forward\r\nin silence.", "Then--“I guess she had better go alone,” she said simply.", "Winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of\r\nmaternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the\r\nforefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of\r\nthe lake.", "But his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very\r\ndistinctly pronounced by Mrs.", "Miller’s unprotected daughter.", "“Mr.", "Winterbourne!” murmured Daisy.", "“Mademoiselle!” said the young man.", "“Don’t you want to take me out in a boat?”\r\n\r\n“At present?” he asked.", "“Of course!” said Daisy.", "“Well, Annie Miller!” exclaimed her mother.", "“I beg you, madam, to let her go,” said Winterbourne ardently;

now we can go!” said Mrs. Miller. Daisy turned away from Winterbourne, looking at him, smiling and fanning\r\nherself. “Good night,” she said; “I hope you are disappointed, or\r\ndisgusted, or something!”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, taking the hand she offered him. “I am puzzled,” he\r\nanswered. “Well, I hope it won’t keep you awake!” she said very smartly; and,\r\nunder the escort of the privileged Eugenio, the two ladies passed toward\r\nthe house. Winterbourne stood looking after them; he was indeed puzzled. He\r\nlingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour, turning over the\r\nmystery of the young girl’s sudden familiarities and caprices. But\r\nthe only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy\r\ndeucedly “going off” with her somewhere. Two days afterward he went off with her to the Castle of Chillon. He\r\nwaited for her in the large hall of the hotel, where the couriers, the\r\nservants, the foreign tourists, were lounging about and staring. It was\r\nnot the place he should have chosen, but she had appointed it. She came\r\ntripping downstairs, buttoning her long gloves, squeezing her folded\r\nparasol against her pretty figure, dressed in the perfection of a\r\nsoberly elegant traveling costume. Winterbourne was a man of imagination\r\nand, as our ancestors used to say, sensibility; as he looked at her\r\ndress and, on the great staircase, her little rapid, confiding step, he\r\nfelt as if there were something romantic going forward. He could have\r\nbelieved he was going to elope with her. He passed out with her among\r\nall the idle people that were assembled there; they were all looking\r\nat her very hard; she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him. Winterbourne’s preference had been that they should be conveyed to\r\nChillon in a carriage; but she expressed a lively wish to go in the\r\nlittle steamer; she declared that she had a passion for steamboats. There was always such a lovely breeze upon the water, and you saw such\r\nlots of people. The sail was not long, but Winterbourne’s companion\r\nfound time to say a great many things. To the young man himself their\r\nlittle excursion was so much of an escapade--an adventure--that, even\r\nallowing for her habitual sense of freedom, he had some expectation of\r\nseeing her regard it in the same way. But it must be confessed that,\r\nin this particular, he was disappointed. Daisy Miller was extremely\r\nanimated, she was in charming spirits; but she was apparently not at all\r\nexcited; she was not fluttered; she avoided neither his eyes nor those\r\nof anyone else; she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she\r\nfelt that people were looking at her. People continued to look at her\r\na great deal, and Winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty\r\ncompanion’s distinguished air. He had been a little afraid that she\r\nwould talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about\r\nthe boat a good deal. But he quite forgot his fears; he sat smiling,\r\nwith his eyes upon her face, while, without moving from her place, she\r\ndelivered herself of a great number of original reflections. It was the\r\nmost charming garrulity he had ever heard. He had assented to the idea\r\nthat she was “common”; but was she so, after all, or was he simply\r\ngetting used to her commonness? Her conversation was chiefly of what\r\nmetaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a\r\nsubjective turn. “What on EARTH are you so grave about?” she suddenly demanded, fixing\r\nher agreeable eyes upon Winterbourne’s. “Am I grave?” he asked. “I had an idea I was grinning from ear to ear.”\r\n\r\n“You look as if you were taking me to a funeral.

You’re a queer mixture!”\r\n\r\nIn the castle, after they had landed, the subjective element decidedly\r\nprevailed. Daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers, rustled her skirts\r\nin the corkscrew staircases, flirted back with a pretty little cry and\r\na shudder from the edge of the oubliettes, and turned a singularly\r\nwell-shaped ear to everything that Winterbourne told her about the\r\nplace. But he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and\r\nthat the dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon\r\nher. They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without\r\nother companionship than that of the custodian; and Winterbourne\r\narranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried--that\r\nthey should linger and pause wherever they chose. The custodian\r\ninterpreted the bargain generously--Winterbourne, on his side, had been\r\ngenerous--and ended by leaving them quite to themselves. Miss Miller’s\r\nobservations were not remarkable for logical consistency; for anything\r\nshe wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext. She found a great many\r\npretexts in the rugged embrasures of Chillon for asking Winterbourne\r\nsudden questions about himself--his family, his previous history, his\r\ntastes, his habits, his intentions--and for supplying information upon\r\ncorresponding points in her own personality. Of her own tastes, habits,\r\nand intentions Miss Miller was prepared to give the most definite, and\r\nindeed the most favorable account. “Well, I hope you know enough!” she said to her companion, after he had\r\ntold her the history of the unhappy Bonivard. “I never saw a man that\r\nknew so much!” The history of Bonivard had evidently, as they say, gone\r\ninto one ear and out of the other. But Daisy went on to say that she\r\nwished Winterbourne would travel with them and “go round” with them;\r\nthey might know something, in that case. “Don’t you want to come\r\nand teach Randolph?” she asked. Winterbourne said that nothing\r\ncould possibly please him so much, but that he had unfortunately other\r\noccupations. “Other occupations? I don’t believe it!” said Miss Daisy. “What do you mean? You are not in business.” The young man admitted that\r\nhe was not in business; but he had engagements which, even within a day\r\nor two, would force him to go back to Geneva. “Oh, bother!” she said; “I\r\ndon’t believe it!” and she began to talk about something else. But a few\r\nmoments later, when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an\r\nantique fireplace, she broke out irrelevantly, “You don’t mean to say\r\nyou are going back to Geneva?”\r\n\r\n“It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva\r\ntomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Winterbourne,” said Daisy, “I think you’re horrid!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t say such dreadful things!” said Winterbourne--“just at the\r\nlast!”\r\n\r\n“The last!” cried the young girl; “I call it the first. I have half a\r\nmind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone.” And\r\nfor the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid. Poor\r\nWinterbourne was fairly bewildered; no young lady had as yet done him\r\nthe honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements. His\r\ncompanion, after this, ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of\r\nChillon or the beauties of the lake; she opened fire upon the mysterious\r\ncharmer in Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for\r\ngranted that he was hurrying back to see. How did Miss Daisy Miller\r\nknow that there was a charmer in Geneva? Winterbourne, who denied the\r\nexistence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he was\r\ndivided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement\r\nat the frankness of her persiflage.

If he had missed the\r\npersonal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance. It sounded very distinctly, at last, in her telling him she would stop\r\n“teasing” him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in\r\nthe winter. “That’s not a difficult promise to make,” said Winterbourne. “My aunt\r\nhas taken an apartment in Rome for the winter and has already asked me\r\nto come and see her.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want you to come for your aunt,” said Daisy; “I want you to\r\ncome for me.” And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever\r\nto hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. He declared that, at\r\nany rate, he would certainly come. After this Daisy stopped teasing. Winterbourne took a carriage, and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk;\r\nthe young girl was very quiet. In the evening Winterbourne mentioned to Mrs. Costello that he had spent\r\nthe afternoon at Chillon with Miss Daisy Miller. “The Americans--of the courier?” asked this lady. “Ah, happily,” said Winterbourne, “the courier stayed at home.”\r\n\r\n“She went with you all alone?”\r\n\r\n“All alone.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle. “And that,” she\r\nexclaimed, “is the young person whom you wanted me to know!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nWinterbourne, who had returned to Geneva the day after his excursion\r\nto Chillon, went to Rome toward the end of January. His aunt had been\r\nestablished there for several weeks, and he had received a couple of\r\nletters from her. “Those people you were so devoted to last summer at\r\nVevey have turned up here, courier and all,” she wrote. “They seem to\r\nhave made several acquaintances, but the courier continues to be the\r\nmost intime. The young lady, however, is also very intimate with some\r\nthird-rate Italians, with whom she rackets about in a way that makes\r\nmuch talk. Bring me that pretty novel of Cherbuliez’s--Paule Mere--and\r\ndon’t come later than the 23rd.”\r\n\r\nIn the natural course of events, Winterbourne, on arriving in Rome,\r\nwould presently have ascertained Mrs. Miller’s address at the American\r\nbanker’s and have gone to pay his compliments to Miss Daisy. “After what\r\nhappened at Vevey, I think I may certainly call upon them,” he said to\r\nMrs. Costello. “If, after what happens--at Vevey and everywhere--you desire to keep\r\nup the acquaintance, you are very welcome. Of course a man may know\r\neveryone. Men are welcome to the privilege!”\r\n\r\n“Pray what is it that happens--here, for instance?” Winterbourne\r\ndemanded. “The girl goes about alone with her foreigners. As to what happens\r\nfurther, you must apply elsewhere for information. She has picked up\r\nhalf a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters, and she takes them\r\nabout to people’s houses.

They are very dreadful people.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne meditated a moment. “They are very ignorant--very innocent\r\nonly. Depend upon it they are not bad.”\r\n\r\n“They are hopelessly vulgar,” said Mrs. Costello. “Whether or no being\r\nhopelessly vulgar is being ‘bad’ is a question for the metaphysicians. They are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life\r\nthat is quite enough.”\r\n\r\nThe news that Daisy Miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful\r\nmustaches checked Winterbourne’s impulse to go straightway to see her.", "sentences": ["“Does she never allow\r\nyou more than three days at a time?” asked Daisy ironically.", "“Doesn’t\r\nshe give you a vacation in summer?", "There’s no one so hard worked but\r\nthey can get leave to go off somewhere at this season.", "I suppose, if you\r\nstay another day, she’ll come after you in the boat.", "Do wait over\r\ntill Friday, and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive!”\r\n Winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in\r\nthe temper in which the young lady had embarked.", "If he had missed the\r\npersonal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance.", "It sounded very distinctly, at last, in her telling him she would stop\r\n“teasing” him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in\r\nthe winter.", "“That’s not a difficult promise to make,” said Winterbourne.", "“My aunt\r\nhas taken an apartment in Rome for the winter and has already asked me\r\nto come and see her.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want you to come for your aunt,” said Daisy;

the image of a very pretty\r\ngirl looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently\r\nwhen Mr. Winterbourne would arrive. If, however, he determined to wait a\r\nlittle before reminding Miss Miller of his claims to her consideration,\r\nhe went very soon to call upon two or three other friends. One of these\r\nfriends was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva,\r\nwhere she had placed her children at school. She was a very accomplished\r\nwoman, and she lived in the Via Gregoriana. Winterbourne found her in a\r\nlittle crimson drawing room on a third floor; the room was filled with\r\nsouthern sunshine. He had not been there ten minutes when the servant\r\ncame in, announcing “Madame Mila!” This announcement was presently\r\nfollowed by the entrance of little Randolph Miller, who stopped in the\r\nmiddle of the room and stood staring at Winterbourne. An instant later\r\nhis pretty sister crossed the threshold; and then, after a considerable\r\ninterval, Mrs. Miller slowly advanced. “I know you!” said Randolph. “I’m sure you know a great many things,” exclaimed Winterbourne, taking\r\nhim by the hand. “How is your education coming on?”\r\n\r\nDaisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess, but when\r\nshe heard Winterbourne’s voice she quickly turned her head. “Well, I\r\ndeclare!” she said. “I told you I should come, you know,” Winterbourne rejoined, smiling. “Well, I didn’t believe it,” said Miss Daisy. “I am much obliged to you,” laughed the young man. “You might have come to see me!” said Daisy. “I arrived only yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe that!” the young girl declared. Winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother, but this lady\r\nevaded his glance, and, seating herself, fixed her eyes upon her son. “We’ve got a bigger place than this,” said Randolph. “It’s all gold on\r\nthe walls.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Miller turned uneasily in her chair. “I told you if I were to bring\r\nyou, you would say something!” she murmured. “I told YOU!” Randolph exclaimed. “I tell YOU, sir!” he added jocosely,\r\ngiving Winterbourne a thump on the knee. “It IS bigger, too!”\r\n\r\nDaisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess;\r\nWinterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother. “I\r\nhope you have been well since we parted at Vevey,” he said. Mrs. Miller now certainly looked at him--at his chin. “Not very well,\r\nsir,” she answered. “She’s got the dyspepsia,” said Randolph. “I’ve got it too. Father’s got\r\nit. I’ve got it most!”\r\n\r\nThis announcement, instead of embarrassing Mrs. Miller, seemed to\r\nrelieve her. “I suffer from the liver,” she said. “I think it’s this\r\nclimate; it’s less bracing than Schenectady, especially in the winter\r\nseason. I don’t know whether you know we reside at Schenectady. I was\r\nsaying to Daisy that I certainly hadn’t found any one like Dr. Davis,\r\nand I didn’t believe I should. Oh, at Schenectady he stands first; they\r\nthink everything of him. He has so much to do, and yet there was nothing\r\nhe wouldn’t do for me. He said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia,\r\nbut he was bound to cure it. I’m sure there was nothing he wouldn’t\r\ntry. He was just going to try something new when we came off. Mr. Miller\r\nwanted Daisy to see Europe for herself. But I wrote to Mr. Miller that\r\nit seems as if I couldn’t get on without Dr. Davis.

We had been led to expect something different.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, wait a little, and you will become very fond of it,” said\r\nWinterbourne. “I hate it worse and worse every day!” cried Randolph. “You are like the infant Hannibal,” said Winterbourne. “No, I ain’t!” Randolph declared at a venture. “You are not much like an infant,” said his mother. “But we have seen\r\nplaces,” she resumed, “that I should put a long way before Rome.” And in\r\nreply to Winterbourne’s interrogation, “There’s Zurich,” she concluded,\r\n“I think Zurich is lovely; and we hadn’t heard half so much about it.”\r\n\r\n“The best place we’ve seen is the City of Richmond!” said Randolph. “He means the ship,” his mother explained. “We crossed in that ship.

Winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at\r\nleast found some gratification in Rome, and she declared that Daisy\r\nwas quite carried away. “It’s on account of the society--the society’s\r\nsplendid.

Of course, it’s a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows\r\nplenty of gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Daisy had turned her attention again to Winterbourne. “I’ve\r\nbeen telling Mrs. Walker how mean you were!” the young girl announced. “And what is the evidence you have offered?” asked Winterbourne, rather\r\nannoyed at Miss Miller’s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer\r\nwho on his way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at\r\nFlorence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience. He\r\nremembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that American\r\nwomen--the pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiom--were at\r\nonce the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense\r\nof indebtedness. “Why, you were awfully mean at Vevey,” said Daisy. “You wouldn’t do\r\nanything. You wouldn’t stay there when I asked you.”\r\n\r\n“My dearest young lady,” cried Winterbourne, with eloquence, “have I\r\ncome all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches?”\r\n\r\n“Just hear him say that!” said Daisy to her hostess, giving a twist to a\r\nbow on this lady’s dress. “Did you ever hear anything so quaint?”\r\n\r\n“So quaint, my dear?” murmured Mrs. Walker in the tone of a partisan of\r\nWinterbourne. “Well, I don’t know,” said Daisy, fingering Mrs. Walker’s ribbons. “Mrs. Walker, I want to tell you something.”\r\n\r\n“Mother-r,” interposed Randolph, with his rough ends to his words, “I\r\ntell you you’ve got to go. Eugenio’ll raise--something!”\r\n\r\n“I’m not afraid of Eugenio,” said Daisy with a toss of her head. “Look\r\nhere, Mrs. Walker,” she went on, “you know I’m coming to your party.”\r\n\r\n“I am delighted to hear it.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a lovely dress!”\r\n\r\n“I am very sure of that.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to ask a favor--permission to bring a friend.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be happy to see any of your friends,” said Mrs. Walker, turning\r\nwith a smile to Mrs. Miller. “Oh, they are not my friends,” answered Daisy’s mamma, smiling shyly in\r\nher own fashion. “I never spoke to them.”\r\n\r\n“It’s an intimate friend of mine--Mr. Giovanelli,” said Daisy without\r\na tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little\r\nface. Mrs. Walker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at\r\nWinterbourne. “I shall be glad to see Mr. Giovanelli,” she then said. “He’s an Italian,” Daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity. “He’s a\r\ngreat friend of mine; he’s the handsomest man in the world--except Mr. Winterbourne!", "sentences": ["“We had heard\r\nso much about it; I suppose we had heard too much.", "But we couldn’t help\r\nthat.", "We had been led to expect something different.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, wait a little, and you will become very fond of it,” said\r\nWinterbourne.", "“I hate it worse and worse every day!” cried Randolph.", "“You are like the infant Hannibal,” said Winterbourne.", "“No, I ain’t!” Randolph declared at a venture.", "“You are not much like an infant,” said his mother.", "“But we have seen\r\nplaces,” she resumed, “that I should put a long way before Rome.” And in\r\nreply to Winterbourne’s interrogation, “There’s Zurich,” she concluded,\r\n“I think Zurich is lovely; and we hadn’t heard half so much about it.”\r\n\r\n“The best place we’ve seen is the City of Richmond!” said Randolph.", "“He means the ship,” his mother explained.", "“We crossed in that ship.", "Randolph had a good time on the City of Richmond.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the best place I’ve seen,” the child repeated.", "“Only it was turned\r\nthe wrong way.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve got to turn the right way some time,” said Mrs.", "Miller with\r\na little laugh.", "Winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at\r\nleast found some gratification in Rome, and she declared that Daisy\r\nwas quite carried away.", "“It’s on account of the society--the society’s\r\nsplendid.", "She goes round everywhere; she has made a great number of\r\nacquaintances.", "Of course she goes round more than I do.", "I must say they\r\nhave been very sociable; they have taken her right in.", "And then she\r\nknows a great many gentlemen.", "Oh, she thinks there’s nothing like Rome.", "Of course, it’s a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows\r\nplenty of gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Daisy had turned her attention again to Winterbourne.", "“I’ve\r\nbeen telling Mrs.", "Walker how mean you were!” the young girl announced.", "“And what is the evidence you have offered?” asked Winterbourne, rather\r\nannoyed at Miss Miller’s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer\r\nwho on his way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at\r\nFlorence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience.", "He\r\nremembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that American\r\nwomen--the pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiom--were at\r\nonce the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense\r\nof indebtedness.", "“Why, you were awfully mean at Vevey,” said Daisy.", "“You wouldn’t do\r\nanything.", "You wouldn’t stay there when I asked you.”\r\n\r\n“My dearest young lady,” cried Winterbourne, with eloquence, “have I\r\ncome all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches?”\r\n\r\n“Just hear him say that!” said Daisy to her hostess, giving a twist to a\r\nbow on this lady’s dress.", "“Did you ever hear anything so quaint?”\r\n\r\n“So quaint, my dear?” murmured Mrs.", "Walker in the tone of a partisan of\r\nWinterbourne.", "“Well, I don’t know,” said Daisy, fingering Mrs.", "Walker’s ribbons.", "“Mrs.", "Walker, I want to tell you something.”\r\n\r\n“Mother-r,” interposed Randolph, with his rough ends to his words, “I\r\ntell you you’ve got to go.", "Eugenio’ll raise--something!”\r\n\r\n“I’m not afraid of Eugenio,” said Daisy with a toss of her head.", "“Look\r\nhere, Mrs.", "Walker,” she went on, “you know I’m coming to your party.”\r\n\r\n“I am delighted to hear it.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a lovely dress!”\r\n\r\n“I am very sure of that.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to ask a favor--permission to bring a friend.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be happy to see any of your friends,” said Mrs.", "Walker, turning\r\nwith a smile to Mrs.", "Miller.", "“Oh, they are not my friends,” answered Daisy’s mamma, smiling shyly in\r\nher own fashion.", "“I never spoke to them.”\r\n\r\n“It’s an intimate friend of mine--Mr.", "Giovanelli,” said Daisy without\r\na tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little\r\nface.", "Mrs.", "Walker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at\r\nWinterbourne.", "“I shall be glad to see Mr.", "Giovanelli,” she then said.", "“He’s an Italian,” Daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity.", "“He’s a\r\ngreat friend of mine; he’s the handsomest man in the world--except Mr.", "Winterbourne!"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Henry James"}, {"id": "txt_it_208_18", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Daisy Miller: A Study (Part 18)", "language": "it", "content": "He knows plenty of Italians, but he wants to know some\r\nAmericans.

The afternoon was\r\ndrawing to a close--it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of\r\ncontemplative pedestrians. “I don’t think it’s safe, my dear,” said Mrs. Walker. “Neither do I,” subjoined Mrs. Miller. “You’ll get the fever, as sure as\r\nyou live. Remember what Dr. Davis told you!”\r\n\r\n“Give her some medicine before she goes,” said Randolph.

Winterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his attention\r\nquickened. She stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons;\r\nshe glanced at Winterbourne. Then, while she glanced and smiled, she\r\nanswered, without a shade of hesitation, “Mr. Giovanelli--the beautiful\r\nGiovanelli.”\r\n\r\n“My dear young friend,” said Mrs. Walker, taking her hand pleadingly,\r\n“don’t walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he speaks English,” said Mrs. Miller. “Gracious me!” Daisy exclaimed, “I don’t to do anything improper. There’s an easy way to settle it.” She continued to glance at\r\nWinterbourne. “The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant; and if Mr. Winterbourne were as polite as he pretends, he would offer to walk with\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne’s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl\r\ngave him gracious leave to accompany her. They passed downstairs\r\nbefore her mother, and at the door Winterbourne perceived Mrs. Miller’s\r\ncarriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had\r\nmade at Vevey seated within. “Goodbye, Eugenio!” cried Daisy; “I’m going\r\nto take a walk.” The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful\r\ngarden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is, in fact, rapidly\r\ntraversed. As the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of\r\nvehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young Americans found\r\ntheir progress much delayed. This fact was highly agreeable to\r\nWinterbourne, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation. The slow-moving, idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon\r\nthe extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon\r\nhis arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in Daisy’s mind when\r\nshe proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation. His own\r\nmission, to her sense, apparently, was to consign her to the hands\r\nof Mr. Giovanelli; but Winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified,\r\nresolved that he would do no such thing. “Why haven’t you been to see me?” asked Daisy. “You can’t get out of\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out\r\nof the train.”\r\n\r\n“You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!” cried\r\nthe young girl with her little laugh. “I suppose you were asleep. You\r\nhave had time to go to see Mrs. Walker.”\r\n\r\n“I knew Mrs. Walker--” Winterbourne began to explain. “I know where you knew her. You knew her at Geneva. She told me so. Well, you knew me at Vevey. That’s just as good. So you ought to have\r\ncome.” She asked him no other question than this; she began to prattle\r\nabout her own affairs.", "sentences": ["He knows plenty of Italians, but he wants to know some\r\nAmericans.", "He thinks ever so much of Americans.", "He’s tremendously\r\nclever.", "He’s perfectly lovely!”\r\n\r\nIt was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to Mrs.", "Walker’s party, and then Mrs.", "Miller prepared to take her leave.", "“I\r\nguess we’ll go back to the hotel,” she said.", "“You may go back to the hotel, Mother, but I’m going to take a walk,”\r\n said Daisy.", "“She’s going to walk with Mr.", "Giovanelli,” Randolph proclaimed.", "“I am going to the Pincio,” said Daisy, smiling.", "“Alone, my dear--at this hour?” Mrs.", "Walker asked.", "The afternoon was\r\ndrawing to a close--it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of\r\ncontemplative pedestrians.", "“I don’t think it’s safe, my dear,” said Mrs.", "Walker.", "“Neither do I,” subjoined Mrs.", "Miller.", "“You’ll get the fever, as sure as\r\nyou live.", "Remember what Dr.", "Davis told you!”\r\n\r\n“Give her some medicine before she goes,” said Randolph.", "The company had risen to its feet; Daisy, still showing her pretty\r\nteeth, bent over and kissed her hostess.", "“Mrs.", "Walker, you are too\r\nperfect,” she said.", "“I’m not going alone; I am going to meet a friend.”\r\n\r\n“Your friend won’t keep you from getting the fever,” Mrs.", "Miller\r\nobserved.", "“Is it Mr.", "Giovanelli?” asked the hostess.", "Winterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his attention\r\nquickened.", "She stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons;\r\nshe glanced at Winterbourne.", "Then, while she glanced and smiled, she\r\nanswered, without a shade of hesitation, “Mr.", "Giovanelli--the beautiful\r\nGiovanelli.”\r\n\r\n“My dear young friend,” said Mrs.", "Walker, taking her hand pleadingly,\r\n“don’t walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he speaks English,” said Mrs.", "Miller.", "“Gracious me!” Daisy exclaimed, “I don’t to do anything improper.", "There’s an easy way to settle it.” She continued to glance at\r\nWinterbourne.", "“The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant; and if Mr.", "Winterbourne were as polite as he pretends, he would offer to walk with\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne’s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl\r\ngave him gracious leave to accompany her.", "They passed downstairs\r\nbefore her mother, and at the door Winterbourne perceived Mrs.", "Miller’s\r\ncarriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had\r\nmade at Vevey seated within.", "“Goodbye, Eugenio!” cried Daisy; “I’m going\r\nto take a walk.” The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful\r\ngarden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is, in fact, rapidly\r\ntraversed.", "As the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of\r\nvehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young Americans found\r\ntheir progress much delayed.", "This fact was highly agreeable to\r\nWinterbourne, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation.", "The slow-moving, idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon\r\nthe extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon\r\nhis arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in Daisy’s mind when\r\nshe proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation.", "His own\r\nmission, to her sense, apparently, was to consign her to the hands\r\nof Mr.", "Giovanelli; but Winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified,\r\nresolved that he would do no such thing.", "“Why haven’t you been to see me?” asked Daisy.", "“You can’t get out of\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out\r\nof the train.”\r\n\r\n“You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!” cried\r\nthe young girl with her little laugh.", "“I suppose you were asleep.", "You\r\nhave had time to go to see Mrs.", "Walker.”\r\n\r\n“I knew Mrs.", "Walker--” Winterbourne began to explain.", "“I know where you knew her.", "You knew her at Geneva.", "She told me so.", "Well, you knew me at Vevey.", "That’s just as good.", "So you ought to have\r\ncome.” She asked him no other question than this; she began to prattle\r\nabout her own affairs."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Henry James"}, {"id": "txt_it_208_19", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Daisy Miller: A Study (Part 19)", "language": "it", "content": "“We’ve got splendid rooms at the hotel; Eugenio\r\nsays they’re the best rooms in Rome. We are going to stay all winter,\r\nif we don’t die of the fever; and I guess we’ll stay then. It’s a great\r\ndeal nicer than I thought; I thought it would be fearfully quiet; I was\r\nsure it would be awfully poky. I was sure we should be going round\r\nall the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the\r\npictures and things. But we only had about a week of that, and now\r\nI’m enjoying myself. I know ever so many people, and they are all so\r\ncharming. The society’s extremely select. There are all kinds--English,\r\nand Germans, and Italians. I think I like the English best. I like their\r\nstyle of conversation. But there are some lovely Americans. I never saw\r\nanything so hospitable. There’s something or other every day. There’s\r\nnot much dancing; but I must say I never thought dancing was everything. I was always fond of conversation. I guess I shall have plenty at Mrs. Walker’s, her rooms are so small.” When they had passed the gate of the\r\nPincian Gardens, Miss Miller began to wonder where Mr. Giovanelli might\r\nbe. “We had better go straight to that place in front,” she said, “where\r\nyou look at the view.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly shall not help you to find him,” Winterbourne declared. “Then I shall find him without you,” cried Miss Daisy. “You certainly won’t leave me!” cried Winterbourne. She burst into her little laugh. “Are you afraid you’ll get lost--or run\r\nover? But there’s Giovanelli, leaning against that tree. He’s staring at\r\nthe women in the carriages: did you ever see anything so cool?”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with\r\nfolded arms nursing his cane. He had a handsome face, an artfully poised\r\nhat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole. Winterbourne\r\nlooked at him a moment and then said, “Do you mean to speak to that\r\nman?”\r\n\r\n“Do I mean to speak to him? Why, you don’t suppose I mean to communicate\r\nby signs?”\r\n\r\n“Pray understand, then,” said Winterbourne, “that I intend to remain\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\nDaisy stopped and looked at him, without a sign of troubled\r\nconsciousness in her face, with nothing but the presence of her charming\r\neyes and her happy dimples. “Well, she’s a cool one!” thought the young\r\nman. “I don’t like the way you say that,” said Daisy. “It’s too imperious.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon if I say it wrong. The main point is to give you an\r\nidea of my meaning.”\r\n\r\nThe young girl looked at him more gravely, but with eyes that were\r\nprettier than ever. “I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me,\r\nor to interfere with anything I do.”\r\n\r\n“I think you have made a mistake,” said Winterbourne. “You should\r\nsometimes listen to a gentleman--the right one.”\r\n\r\nDaisy began to laugh again. “I do nothing but listen to gentlemen!” she\r\nexclaimed. “Tell me if Mr. Giovanelli is the right one?”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two\r\nfriends, and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity. He bowed to Winterbourne as well as to the latter’s companion; he had\r\na brilliant smile, an intelligent eye; Winterbourne thought him not a\r\nbad-looking fellow.

He is a music master, or a\r\npenny-a-liner, or a third-rate artist. D__n his good looks!” Mr. Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face; but Winterbourne felt a\r\nsuperior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman’s not knowing\r\nthe difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one. Giovanelli\r\nchattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable. It was\r\ntrue that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant. “Nevertheless,” Winterbourne said to himself, “a nice girl ought to\r\nknow!” And then he came back to the question whether this was, in fact,\r\na nice girl. Would a nice girl, even allowing for her being a little\r\nAmerican flirt, make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner? The rendezvous in this case, indeed, had been in broad daylight and in\r\nthe most crowded corner of Rome, but was it not impossible to regard the\r\nchoice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism? Singular\r\nthough it may seem, Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl, in\r\njoining her amoroso, should not appear more impatient of his own\r\ncompany, and he was vexed because of his inclination. It was impossible\r\nto regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady; she was wanting\r\nin a certain indispensable delicacy.

But Daisy, on this occasion, continued to present herself as\r\nan inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence. She had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her two\r\ncavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it\r\nseemed to Winterbourne, to the pretty speeches of Mr. Giovanelli, when\r\na carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up\r\nbeside the path. At the same moment Winterbourne perceived that his\r\nfriend Mrs. Walker--the lady whose house he had lately left--was seated\r\nin the vehicle and was beckoning to him. Leaving Miss Miller’s side,\r\nhe hastened to obey her summons. Mrs. Walker was flushed; she wore an\r\nexcited air. “It is really too dreadful,” she said. “That girl must not\r\ndo this sort of thing. She must not walk here with you two men. Fifty\r\npeople have noticed her.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne raised his eyebrows. “I think it’s a pity to make too much\r\nfuss about it.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity to let the girl ruin herself!”\r\n\r\n“She is very innocent,” said Winterbourne. “She’s very crazy!” cried Mrs. Walker. “Did you ever see anything so\r\nimbecile as her mother? After you had all left me just now, I could not\r\nsit still for thinking of it. It seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt\r\nto save her. I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here\r\nas quickly as possible.

And then, you know,” she added with a laugh, “I am more than five years\r\nold.”\r\n\r\n“You are old enough to be more reasonable. You are old enough, dear Miss\r\nMiller, to be talked about.”\r\n\r\nDaisy looked at Mrs. Walker, smiling intensely. “Talked about? What do\r\nyou mean?”\r\n\r\n“Come into my carriage, and I will tell you.”\r\n\r\nDaisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside\r\nher to the other. Mr. Giovanelli was bowing to and fro, rubbing down\r\nhis gloves and laughing very agreeably; Winterbourne thought it a most\r\nunpleasant scene. “I don’t think I want to know what you mean,” said\r\nDaisy presently. “I don’t think I should like it.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne wished that Mrs. Walker would tuck in her carriage rug and\r\ndrive away, but this lady did not enjoy being defied, as she afterward\r\ntold him. “Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl?” she\r\ndemanded. “Gracious!” exclaimed Daisy. She looked again at Mr. Giovanelli, then\r\nshe turned to Winterbourne. There was a little pink flush in her cheek;\r\nshe was tremendously pretty. “Does Mr. Winterbourne think,” she asked\r\nslowly, smiling, throwing back her head, and glancing at him from\r\nhead to foot, “that, to save my reputation, I ought to get into the\r\ncarriage?”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne colored; for an instant he hesitated greatly. It seemed so\r\nstrange to hear her speak that way of her “reputation.” But he himself,\r\nin fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry. The finest gallantry,\r\nhere, was simply to tell her the truth; and the truth, for Winterbourne,\r\nas the few indications I have been able to give have made him known to\r\nthe reader, was that Daisy Miller should take Mrs. Walker’s advice. He\r\nlooked at her exquisite prettiness, and then he said, very gently, “I\r\nthink you should get into the carriage.”\r\n\r\nDaisy gave a violent laugh. “I never heard anything so stiff! If this\r\nis improper, Mrs. Walker,” she pursued, “then I am all improper, and you\r\nmust give me up. Goodbye; I hope you’ll have a lovely ride!” and, with\r\nMr. Giovanelli, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she turned\r\naway.

The young man answered that he felt bound to accompany Miss\r\nMiller, whereupon Mrs. Walker declared that if he refused her this\r\nfavor she would never speak to him again. She was evidently in earnest. Winterbourne overtook Daisy and her companion, and, offering the young\r\ngirl his hand, told her that Mrs. Walker had made an imperious claim\r\nupon his society. He expected that in answer she would say something\r\nrather free, something to commit herself still further to that\r\n“recklessness” from which Mrs. Walker had so charitably endeavored to\r\ndissuade her.

I\r\nwish to be EARNEST!”\r\n\r\n“Well, your earnestness has only offended her and put her off.”\r\n\r\n“It has happened very well,” said Mrs. Walker. “If she is so perfectly\r\ndetermined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better;\r\none can act accordingly.”\r\n\r\n“I suspect she meant no harm,” Winterbourne rejoined. “So I thought a month ago. But she has been going too far.”\r\n\r\n“What has she been doing?”\r\n\r\n“Everything that is not done here. Flirting with any man she could pick\r\nup; sitting in corners with mysterious Italians; dancing all the evening\r\nwith the same partners; receiving visits at eleven o’clock at night. Her\r\nmother goes away when visitors come.”\r\n\r\n“But her brother,” said Winterbourne, laughing, “sits up till midnight.”\r\n\r\n“He must be edified by what he sees. I’m told that at their hotel\r\neveryone is talking about her, and that a smile goes round among all the\r\nservants when a gentleman comes and asks for Miss Miller.”\r\n\r\n“The servants be hanged!” said Winterbourne angrily. “The poor girl’s\r\nonly fault,” he presently added, “is that she is very uncultivated.”\r\n\r\n“She is naturally indelicate,” Mrs. Walker declared. “Take that example this morning. How long had you known her at Vevey?”\r\n\r\n“A couple of days.”\r\n\r\n“Fancy, then, her making it a personal matter that you should have left\r\nthe place!”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was silent for some moments; then he said, “I suspect, Mrs. Walker, that you and I have lived too long at Geneva!” And he added a\r\nrequest that she should inform him with what particular design she had\r\nmade him enter her carriage. “I wished to beg you to cease your relations with Miss Miller--not to\r\nflirt with her--to give her no further opportunity to expose herself--to\r\nlet her alone, in short.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I can’t do that,” said Winterbourne. “I like her extremely.”\r\n\r\n“All the more reason that you shouldn’t help her to make a scandal.”\r\n\r\n“There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her.”\r\n\r\n“There certainly will be in the way she takes them. But I have said what\r\nI had on my conscience,” Mrs. Walker pursued. “If you wish to rejoin the\r\nyoung lady I will put you down. Here, by the way, you have a chance.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that\r\noverhangs the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese. It is bordered by a large parapet, near which there are several seats. One of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady,\r\ntoward whom Mrs. Walker gave a toss of her head. At the same moment\r\nthese persons rose and walked toward the parapet. Winterbourne had asked\r\nthe coachman to stop; he now descended from the carriage. His companion\r\nlooked at him a moment in silence; then, while he raised his hat, she\r\ndrove majestically away. Winterbourne stood there; he had turned his\r\neyes toward Daisy and her cavalier. They evidently saw no one; they were\r\ntoo deeply occupied with each other. When they reached the low garden\r\nwall, they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine\r\nclusters of the Villa Borghese; then Giovanelli seated himself,\r\nfamiliarly, upon the broad ledge of the wall. The western sun in the\r\nopposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars,\r\nwhereupon Daisy’s companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened\r\nit.

This lady and her daughter, however, were not at home; and on\r\nthe next day after, repeating his visit, Winterbourne again had the\r\nmisfortune not to find them. Mrs. Walker’s party took place on the\r\nevening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his last\r\ninterview with the hostess, Winterbourne was among the guests. Mrs. Walker was one of those American ladies who, while residing abroad, make\r\na point, in their own phrase, of studying European society, and she\r\nhad on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born\r\nfellow mortals to serve, as it were, as textbooks. When Winterbourne\r\narrived, Daisy Miller was not there, but in a few moments he saw her\r\nmother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. Mrs. Miller’s hair\r\nabove her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever. As she\r\napproached Mrs. Walker, Winterbourne also drew near. “You see, I’ve come all alone,” said poor Mrs. Miller. “I’m so\r\nfrightened; I don’t know what to do. It’s the first time I’ve ever been\r\nto a party alone, especially in this country. I wanted to bring Randolph\r\nor Eugenio, or someone, but Daisy just pushed me off by myself. I ain’t\r\nused to going round alone.”\r\n\r\n“And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society?”\r\n demanded Mrs. Walker impressively. “Well, Daisy’s all dressed,” said Mrs. Miller with that accent of the\r\ndispassionate, if not of the philosophic, historian with which she\r\nalways recorded the current incidents of her daughter’s career. “She got\r\ndressed on purpose before dinner. But she’s got a friend of hers there;\r\nthat gentleman--the Italian--that she wanted to bring. They’ve got going\r\nat the piano; it seems as if they couldn’t leave off. Mr. Giovanelli\r\nsings splendidly. But I guess they’ll come before very long,” concluded\r\nMrs. Miller hopefully. “I’m sorry she should come in that way,” said Mrs. Walker. “Well, I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before\r\ndinner if she was going to wait three hours,” responded Daisy’s mamma. “I didn’t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit\r\nround with Mr. Giovanelli.”\r\n\r\n“This is most horrible!” said Mrs. Walker, turning away and addressing\r\nherself to Winterbourne. “Elle s’affiche. It’s her revenge for my having\r\nventured to remonstrate with her. When she comes, I shall not speak to\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nDaisy came after eleven o’clock; but she was not, on such an occasion,\r\na young lady to wait to be spoken to. She rustled forward in radiant\r\nloveliness, smiling and chattering, carrying a large bouquet, and\r\nattended by Mr. Giovanelli. Everyone stopped talking and turned and\r\nlooked at her. She came straight to Mrs. Walker. “I’m afraid you thought\r\nI never was coming, so I sent mother off to tell you. I wanted to make\r\nMr. Giovanelli practice some things before he came; you know he sings\r\nbeautifully, and I want you to ask him to sing.

This gentleman bore himself\r\ngallantly. He smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth; he curled his\r\nmustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions\r\nof a handsome Italian at an evening party.

She sat with him in the adjoining room, in the embrasure\r\nof the window, for the rest of the evening. There was an interesting\r\nperformance at the piano, but neither of these young people gave heed\r\nto it. When Daisy came to take leave of Mrs. Walker, this lady\r\nconscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at\r\nthe moment of the young girl’s arrival. She turned her back straight\r\nupon Miss Miller and left her to depart with what grace she might. Winterbourne was standing near the door; he saw it all. Daisy turned\r\nvery pale and looked at her mother, but Mrs. Miller was humbly\r\nunconscious of any violation of the usual social forms. She appeared,\r\nindeed, to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own\r\nstriking observance of them. “Good night, Mrs. Walker,” she said; “we’ve\r\nhad a beautiful evening. You see, if I let Daisy come to parties without\r\nme, I don’t want her to go away without me.” Daisy turned away, looking\r\nwith a pale, grave face at the circle near the door; Winterbourne saw\r\nthat, for the first moment, she was too much shocked and puzzled even\r\nfor indignation. He on his side was greatly touched. “That was very cruel,” he said to Mrs. Walker. “She never enters my drawing room again!” replied his hostess. Since Winterbourne was not to meet her in Mrs. Walker’s drawing room, he\r\nwent as often as possible to Mrs. Miller’s hotel. The ladies were rarely\r\nat home, but when he found them, the devoted Giovanelli was always\r\npresent. Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room\r\nwith Daisy alone, Mrs. Miller being apparently constantly of the opinion\r\nthat discretion is the better part of surveillance. Winterbourne\r\nnoted, at first with surprise, that Daisy on these occasions was never\r\nembarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance; but he very presently began\r\nto feel that she had no more surprises for him; the unexpected in her\r\nbehavior was the only thing to expect. She showed no displeasure at\r\nher tete-a-tete with Giovanelli being interrupted; she could chatter as\r\nfreshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one; there was always,\r\nin her conversation, the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility. Winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in\r\nGiovanelli, it was very singular that she should not take more trouble\r\nto preserve the sanctity of their interviews; and he liked her the more\r\nfor her innocent-looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible\r\ngood humor. He could hardly have said why, but she seemed to him a girl\r\nwho would never be jealous. At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive\r\nsmile on the reader’s part, I may affirm that with regard to the women\r\nwho had hitherto interested him, it very often seemed to Winterbourne\r\namong the possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he should be\r\nafraid--literally afraid--of these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that\r\nhe should never be afraid of Daisy Miller. It must be added that this\r\nsentiment was not altogether flattering to Daisy; it was part of his\r\nconviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very\r\nlight young person. But she was evidently very much interested in Giovanelli.

Mrs. Costello inspected the young couple again with her optical\r\ninstrument. “He is very handsome. One easily sees how it is. She thinks\r\nhim the most elegant man in the world, the finest gentleman. She has\r\nnever seen anything like him; he is better, even, than the courier. It was the courier probably who introduced him; and if he succeeds in\r\nmarrying the young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent\r\ncommission.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe she thinks of marrying him,” said Winterbourne, “and I\r\ndon’t believe he hopes to marry her.”\r\n\r\n“You may be very sure she thinks of nothing. She goes on from day to\r\nday, from hour to hour, as they did in the Golden Age. I can imagine\r\nnothing more vulgar. And at the same time,” added Mrs. Costello, “depend\r\nupon it that she may tell you any moment that she is ‘engaged.’”\r\n\r\n“I think that is more than Giovanelli expects,” said Winterbourne. “Who is Giovanelli?”\r\n\r\n“The little Italian. I have asked questions about him and learned\r\nsomething. He is apparently a perfectly respectable little man. I\r\nbelieve he is, in a small way, a cavaliere avvocato. But he doesn’t\r\nmove in what are called the first circles. I think it is really not\r\nabsolutely impossible that the courier introduced him. He is evidently\r\nimmensely charmed with Miss Miller. If she thinks him the finest\r\ngentleman in the world, he, on his side, has never found himself in\r\npersonal contact with such splendor, such opulence, such expensiveness\r\nas this young lady’s. And then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty\r\nand interesting. I rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her. That\r\nmust appear to him too impossible a piece of luck. He has nothing but\r\nhis handsome face to offer, and there is a substantial Mr. Miller in\r\nthat mysterious land of dollars. Giovanelli knows that he hasn’t a title\r\nto offer. If he were only a count or a marchese! He must wonder at his\r\nluck, at the way they have taken him up.”\r\n\r\n“He accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks Miss Miller a young\r\nlady qui se passe ses fantaisies!” said Mrs. Costello. “It is very true,” Winterbourne pursued, “that Daisy and her mamma have\r\nnot yet risen to that stage of--what shall I call it?--of culture at\r\nwhich the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins.

He felt very sorry for her--not\r\nexactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head, but\r\nbecause it was painful to hear so much that was pretty, and undefended,\r\nand natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder. He made an attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs. Miller. He met one\r\nday in the Corso a friend, a tourist like himself, who had just come\r\nout of the Doria Palace, where he had been walking through the beautiful\r\ngallery. His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait\r\nof Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the\r\npalace, and then said, “And in the same cabinet, by the way, I had the\r\npleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind--that pretty\r\nAmerican girl whom you pointed out to me last week.” In answer to\r\nWinterbourne’s inquiries, his friend narrated that the pretty American\r\ngirl--prettier than ever--was seated with a companion in the secluded\r\nnook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined. “Who was her companion?” asked Winterbourne. “A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole. The girl is\r\ndelightfully pretty, but I thought I understood from you the other day\r\nthat she was a young lady du meilleur monde.”\r\n\r\n“So she is!” answered Winterbourne; and having assured himself that his\r\ninformant had seen Daisy and her companion but five minutes before, he\r\njumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs. Miller. She was at home; but\r\nshe apologized to him for receiving him in Daisy’s absence. “She’s gone out somewhere with Mr. Giovanelli,” said Mrs. Miller. “She’s\r\nalways going round with Mr. Giovanelli.”\r\n\r\n“I have noticed that they are very intimate,” Winterbourne observed. “Oh, it seems as if they couldn’t live without each other!” said Mrs. Miller. “Well, he’s a real gentleman, anyhow. I keep telling Daisy she’s\r\nengaged!”\r\n\r\n“And what does Daisy say?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she says she isn’t engaged. But she might as well be!” this\r\nimpartial parent resumed; “she goes on as if she was. But I’ve made Mr. Giovanelli promise to tell me, if SHE doesn’t. I should want to write to\r\nMr. Miller about it--shouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne replied that he certainly should; and the state of mind of\r\nDaisy’s mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental\r\nvigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her\r\nupon her guard. After this Daisy was never at home, and Winterbourne ceased to meet her\r\nat the houses of their common acquaintances, because, as he perceived,\r\nthese shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too\r\nfar. They ceased to invite her; and they intimated that they desired to\r\nexpress to observant Europeans the great truth that, though Miss\r\nDaisy Miller was a young American lady, her behavior was not\r\nrepresentative--was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal. Winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that\r\nwere turned toward her, and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that\r\nshe did not feel at all. He said to himself that she was too light and\r\nchildish, too uncultivated and unreasoning, too provincial, to have\r\nreflected upon her ostracism, or even to have perceived it. Then at\r\nother moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and\r\nirresponsible little organism a defiant, passionate, perfectly observant\r\nconsciousness of the impression she produced.

As I have already had occasion to relate, he was angry at finding\r\nhimself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady; he was vexed at\r\nhis want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were\r\ngeneric, national, and how far they were personal. From either view\r\nof them he had somehow missed her, and now it was too late. She was\r\n“carried away” by Mr. Giovanelli. A few days after his brief interview with her mother, he encountered her\r\nin that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of\r\nthe Caesars. The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and\r\nperfume, and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender\r\nverdure. Daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds\r\nof ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental\r\ninscriptions. It seemed to him that Rome had never been so lovely as\r\njust then. He stood, looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and\r\ncolor that remotely encircles the city, inhaling the softly humid odors,\r\nand feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place\r\nreaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion. It seemed to him also\r\nthat Daisy had never looked so pretty, but this had been an observation\r\nof his whenever he met her. Giovanelli was at her side, and Giovanelli,\r\ntoo, wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy. “Well,” said Daisy, “I should think you would be lonesome!”\r\n\r\n“Lonesome?” asked Winterbourne. “You are always going round by yourself. Can’t you get anyone to walk\r\nwith you?”\r\n\r\n“I am not so fortunate,” said Winterbourne, “as your companion.”\r\n\r\nGiovanelli, from the first, had treated Winterbourne with distinguished\r\npoliteness. He listened with a deferential air to his remarks; he\r\nlaughed punctiliously at his pleasantries; he seemed disposed to testify\r\nto his belief that Winterbourne was a superior young man. He carried\r\nhimself in no degree like a jealous wooer; he had obviously a great deal\r\nof tact; he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him. It even seemed to Winterbourne at times that Giovanelli would find a\r\ncertain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with\r\nhim--to say to him, as an intelligent man, that, bless you, HE knew\r\nhow extraordinary was this young lady, and didn’t flatter himself with\r\ndelusive--or at least TOO delusive--hopes of matrimony and dollars. On\r\nthis occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of\r\nalmond blossom, which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole. “I know why you say that,” said Daisy, watching Giovanelli. “Because you\r\nthink I go round too much with HIM.” And she nodded at her attendant. “Every one thinks so--if you care to know,” said Winterbourne. “Of course I care to know!” Daisy exclaimed seriously. “But I don’t\r\nbelieve it. They are only pretending to be shocked. They don’t really\r\ncare a straw what I do. Besides, I don’t go round so much.”\r\n\r\n“I think you will find they do care. They will show it disagreeably.”\r\n\r\nDaisy looked at him a moment. “How disagreeably?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you noticed anything?” Winterbourne asked. “I have noticed you. But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the\r\nfirst time I saw you.”\r\n\r\n“You will find I am not so stiff as several others,” said Winterbourne,\r\nsmiling. “How shall I find it?”\r\n\r\n“By going to see the others.”\r\n\r\n“What will they do to me?”\r\n\r\n“They will give you the cold shoulder.

Winterbourne began to laugh. “And does Randolph believe it?” he asked. “I guess Randolph doesn’t believe anything,” said Daisy. Randolph’s\r\nskepticism excited Winterbourne to further hilarity, and he observed\r\nthat Giovanelli was coming back to them.

When, on his\r\nreturn from the villa (it was eleven o’clock), Winterbourne approached\r\nthe dusky circle of the Colosseum, it recurred to him, as a lover of\r\nthe picturesque, that the interior, in the pale moonshine, would be well\r\nworth a glance. He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches,\r\nnear which, as he observed, an open carriage--one of the little Roman\r\nstreetcabs--was stationed. Then he passed in, among the cavernous\r\nshadows of the great structure, and emerged upon the clear and silent\r\narena. The place had never seemed to him more impressive.

The\r\nhistoric atmosphere was there, certainly; but the historic atmosphere,\r\nscientifically considered, was no better than a villainous miasma. Winterbourne walked to the middle of the arena, to take a more general\r\nglance, intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat. The great cross in\r\nthe center was covered with shadow; it was only as he drew near it that\r\nhe made it out distinctly. Then he saw that two persons were stationed\r\nupon the low steps which formed its base. One of these was a woman,\r\nseated; her companion was standing in front of her. Presently the sound of the woman’s voice came to him distinctly in the\r\nwarm night air. “Well, he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers\r\nmay have looked at the Christian martyrs!” These were the words he\r\nheard, in the familiar accent of Miss Daisy Miller. “Let us hope he is not very hungry,” responded the ingenious Giovanelli. “He will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with\r\na sort of relief.

Winterbourne came forward\r\nagain and went toward the great cross. Daisy had got up; Giovanelli\r\nlifted his hat. Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the\r\ncraziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl\r\nlounging away the evening in this nest of malaria.

Daisy followed with Winterbourne. He kept looking at her; she seemed\r\nnot in the least embarrassed. Winterbourne said nothing; Daisy chattered\r\nabout the beauty of the place. “Well, I HAVE seen the Colosseum by\r\nmoonlight!” she exclaimed. “That’s one good thing.” Then, noticing\r\nWinterbourne’s silence, she asked him why he didn’t speak. He made\r\nno answer; he only began to laugh. They passed under one of the dark\r\narchways; Giovanelli was in front with the carriage.

Winterbourne\r\nreflected that they had of course known it at the hotel, and that, after\r\nDaisy’s return, there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter\r\nand the cab driver. But the young man was conscious, at the same moment,\r\nthat it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the\r\nlittle American flirt should be “talked about” by low-minded menials. These people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the\r\nlittle American flirt was alarmingly ill. Winterbourne, when the rumor\r\ncame to him, immediately went to the hotel for more news. He found that\r\ntwo or three charitable friends had preceded him, and that they were\r\nbeing entertained in Mrs. Miller’s salon by Randolph. “It’s going round at night,” said Randolph--“that’s what made her sick. She’s always going round at night. I shouldn’t think she’d want to,\r\nit’s so plaguy dark. You can’t see anything here at night, except when\r\nthere’s a moon. In America there’s always a moon!” Mrs. Miller was\r\ninvisible; she was now, at least, giving her daughter the advantage of\r\nher society. It was evident that Daisy was dangerously ill. Winterbourne went often to ask for news of her, and once he saw Mrs. Miller, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his surprise,\r\nperfectly composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious\r\nnurse. She talked a good deal about Dr. Davis, but Winterbourne paid her\r\nthe compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such\r\na monstrous goose. “Daisy spoke of you the other day,” she said to him. “Half the time she doesn’t know what she’s saying, but that time I think\r\nshe did. She gave me a message she told me to tell you. She told me to\r\ntell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian. I am sure\r\nI am very glad; Mr. Giovanelli hasn’t been near us since she was taken\r\nill. I thought he was so much of a gentleman; but I don’t call that\r\nvery polite! A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for\r\ntaking Daisy round at night. Well, so I am, but I suppose he knows I’m a\r\nlady. I would scorn to scold him. Anyway, she says she’s not engaged. I\r\ndon’t know why she wanted you to know, but she said to me three times,\r\n‘Mind you tell Mr. Winterbourne.’ And then she told me to ask if you\r\nremembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland. But I said\r\nI wouldn’t give any such messages as that. Only, if she is not engaged,\r\nI’m sure I’m glad to know it.”\r\n\r\nBut, as Winterbourne had said, it mattered very little. A week after\r\nthis, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever. Daisy’s grave was in the little Protestant cemetery, in an angle of\r\nthe wall of imperial Rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring\r\nflowers. Winterbourne stood there beside it, with a number of other\r\nmourners, a number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady’s\r\ncareer would have led you to expect. Near him stood Giovanelli, who came\r\nnearer still before Winterbourne turned away. Giovanelli was very pale:\r\non this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole; he seemed to wish\r\nto say something. At last he said, “She was the most beautiful young\r\nlady I ever saw, and the most amiable;” and then he added in a moment,\r\n“and she was the most innocent.”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words, “And the\r\nmost innocent?”\r\n\r\n“The most innocent!”\r\n\r\nWinterbourne felt sore and angry. “Why the devil,” he asked, “did you\r\ntake her to that fatal place?”\r\n\r\nMr. Giovanelli’s urbanity was apparently imperturbable.", "sentences": ["Winterbourne, to do him justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that\r\nhe had encountered Miss Miller, at midnight, in the Colosseum with a\r\ngentleman;

James Cook, the Circumnavigator, was a native of the district of\r\nCleveland, Yorkshire, but of his ancestry there is now very little\r\nsatisfactory information to be obtained. Nichols, in his Topographer and\r\nGenealogist, suggests that \"James Cooke, the celebrated mariner, was\r\nprobably of common origin with the Stockton Cookes.\" His reason for the\r\nsuggestion being that a branch of the family possessed a crayon portrait\r\nof some relation, which was supposed to resemble the great discoverer. He\r\nmakes no explanation of the difference in spelling of the two names, and\r\nadmits that the sailor's family was said to come from Scotland. Dr. George Young, certainly the most reliable authority on Cook's early\r\nyears, who published a Life in 1836, went to Whitby as Vicar about 1805,\r\nand claims to have obtained much information about his subject \"through\r\nintercourse with his relatives, friends, and acquaintances, including one\r\nor two surviving school companions,\" and appears to be satisfied that\r\nCook was of Scotch extraction. Dr. George Johnston, a very careful\r\nwriter, states in his Natural History of the Eastern Borders, that in\r\n1692 the father of James Thomson, the author of The Seasons, was minister\r\nof Ednam, Roxburghshire, and a man named John Cook was one of the Elders\r\nof the Kirk. This John Cook married, on the 19th January 1693, a woman\r\nnamed Jean Duncan, by whom he had a son, James, baptised 4th March 1694,\r\nand this child, Johnston positively asserts, was afterwards the father of\r\nthe future Captain Cook. The dates of the marriage and baptism have been\r\nverified by the Reverend John Burleigh, minister of Ednam, and they agree\r\nwith the probable date of the birth of Cook's father, for he died in 1778\r\nat the age of eighty-five. Owing to the loss of the church records for\r\nsome years after 1698, Mr. Burleigh is unable to trace when this James\r\nCook left Ednam to \"better himself,\" but he would take with him a\r\n\"testificate of church membership\" which might possibly, but not\r\nprobably, still exist.", "sentences": ["(PLATE: CAPTAIN COOK.", "FROM THE PORTRAIT BY N.", "DANCE, R.A., IN THE PAINTED HALL, GREENWICH\r\nHOSPITAL.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF CAPTAIN JAMES COOK\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCUMNAVIGATOR\r\n\r\nBY ARTHUR KITSON.", "WITH PORTRAIT AND MAP.", "1907\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\nMY WIFE\r\nLINDA DOUGLAS KITSON.", "PREFACE.", "In publishing a popular edition of my work, Captain James Cook, R.N.,\r\nF.R.S., it has, of course, been necessary to condense it, but care has\r\nbeen taken to omit nothing of importance, and at the same time a few\r\nslight errors have been corrected, and some new information has been\r\nadded, chiefly relating to the disposition of documents.", "I must not omit this opportunity of thanking the Reviewers for the\r\nextremely kind manner in which they all received the original work--a\r\nmanner, indeed, which far exceeded my highest hopes.", "ARTHUR KITSON.", "LONDON, 1912.", "CONTENTS.", "CHAPTER 1.", "EARLY YEARS.", "CHAPTER 2.", "1755 TO 1757.", "H.M.S.", "EAGLE.", "CHAPTER 3.", "1757 TO 1759.", "H.M.S.", "PEMBROKE.", "CHAPTER 4.", "1759 TO 1762.", "H.M.S.", "NORTHUMBERLAND.", "CHAPTER 5.", "1763 TO 1767.", "NEWFOUNDLAND.", "CHAPTER 6.", "1768.", "PREPARATIONS FOR FIRST VOYAGE.", "CHAPTER 7.", "1768 TO 1769.", "PLYMOUTH TO OTAHEITE.", "CHAPTER 8.", "1769.", "SOCIETY ISLANDS.", "CHAPTER 9.", "1769 TO 1770.", "NEW ZEALAND.", "CHAPTER 10.", "1770.", "AUSTRALIA.", "CHAPTER 11.", "1770 TO 1771.", "NEW GUINEA TO ENGLAND.", "CHAPTER 12.", "1771.", "PREPARATIONS FOR SECOND VOYAGE.", "CHAPTER 13.", "1772 TO 1774.", "SECOND VOYAGE.", "CHAPTER 14.", "1774 TO 1775.", "SECOND VOYAGE CONCLUDED.", "CHAPTER 15.", "1775 TO 1776.", "ENGLAND.", "CHAPTER 16.", "1776 TO 1777.", "THIRD VOYAGE.", "CHAPTER 17.", "1777 TO 1779.", "THIRD VOYAGE CONTINUED.", "CHAPTER 18.", "1779 TO 1780.", "THIRD VOYAGE CONCLUDED.", "CHAPTER 19.", "APPRECIATION AND CHARACTER.", "JAMES COOK, R.N., F.R.S.", "CHAPTER 1.", "EARLY YEARS.", "James Cook, the Circumnavigator, was a native of the district of\r\nCleveland, Yorkshire, but of his ancestry there is now very little\r\nsatisfactory information to be obtained.", "Nichols, in his Topographer and\r\nGenealogist, suggests that \"James Cooke, the celebrated mariner, was\r\nprobably of common origin with the Stockton Cookes.\" His reason for the\r\nsuggestion being that a branch of the family possessed a crayon portrait\r\nof some relation, which was supposed to resemble the great discoverer.", "He\r\nmakes no explanation of the difference in spelling of the two names, and\r\nadmits that the sailor's family was said to come from Scotland.", "Dr.", "George Young, certainly the most reliable authority on Cook's early\r\nyears, who published a Life in 1836, went to Whitby as Vicar about 1805,\r\nand claims to have obtained much information about his subject \"through\r\nintercourse with his relatives, friends, and acquaintances, including one\r\nor two surviving school companions,\" and appears to be satisfied that\r\nCook was of Scotch extraction.", "Dr.", "George Johnston, a very careful\r\nwriter, states in his Natural History of the Eastern Borders, that in\r\n1692 the father of James Thomson, the author of The Seasons, was minister\r\nof Ednam, Roxburghshire, and a man named John Cook was one of the Elders\r\nof the Kirk.", "This John Cook married, on the 19th January 1693, a woman\r\nnamed Jean Duncan, by whom he had a son, James, baptised 4th March 1694,\r\nand this child, Johnston positively asserts, was afterwards the father of\r\nthe future Captain Cook.", "The dates of the marriage and baptism have been\r\nverified by the Reverend John Burleigh, minister of Ednam, and they agree\r\nwith the probable date of the birth of Cook's father, for he died in 1778\r\nat the age of eighty-five.", "Owing to the loss of the church records for\r\nsome years after 1698, Mr.", "Burleigh is unable to trace when this James\r\nCook left Ednam to \"better himself,\" but he would take with him a\r\n\"testificate of church membership\" which might possibly, but not\r\nprobably, still exist."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_2", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 2)", "language": "it", "content": "Attracted, perhaps, by the number of Scotch people\r\nwho flocked into the north of Yorkshire to follow the alum trade, then at\r\nits height, James Cook settled down and married;

Dr. Young says that James Cook had a superstition that his mother's farewell\r\nwas prophetic of his marriage, for her words were \"God send you Grace.\"\r\n\r\nBIRTH-PLACE. Shortly after the birth of John, the Cooks left Morton for Marton, a\r\nvillage a few miles away, and the similarity of the two names has caused\r\nsome confusion. At Marton the father worked for a Mr. Mewburn, living in\r\na small cottage built of mud, called in the district a clay biggin. This\r\ncottage was pulled down in 1786, when Major Rudd erected a mansion near\r\nthe spot. Afterwards, when the mansion was burned to the ground, the site\r\nof the cottage was planted with trees, and was popularly known as Cook's\r\nGarth. Dr. Young was shown the spot by an old shoemaker whose wife's\r\nmother was present at Captain Cook's birth, and he says there was a\r\nwillow-tree occupying the site, but no vestige of the walls was left. Mr. Bolckow, the present owner of Marton Hall, says: \"The cottage was found\r\ndestroyed when my uncle bought Marton in 1854, but we came across the\r\nfoundations of it when the grounds were laid out.\" A granite vase has\r\nbeen erected on the spot. The pump which Besant says still exists, and\r\nwas made by Cook's father to supply his house with water, was \"put there\r\nafter Cook's time,\" and has disappeared. In this humble clay biggin James Cook, the Circumnavigator, was born on\r\n27th October 1728, and was registered as baptised on 3rd November in the\r\nMarton church records, being entered as \"ye son of a day labourer.\" He\r\nwas one of several children, most of whom died young; John, the eldest,\r\nwho lived till he was twenty-three, and Margaret, who married a Redcar\r\nfisherman named James Fleck, being the only two that came to maturity. The Cooks remained at Marton for some years, during which time they\r\nremoved to another cottage, and young James received some instruction\r\nfrom a Mistress Mary Walker, who taught him his letters and a little\r\nreading. Dr. Young and Kippis call her the village schoolmistress, but\r\nOrd, who was a descendant on his mother's side, says:\r\n\r\n\"she was the daughter of the wealthiest farmer in the neighbourhood, and\r\nwife of William Walker, a respectable yeoman of the first class residing\r\nat Marton Grange.\"\r\n\r\nYoung James, a lad of less than eight years old, worked for Mr. Walker:\r\n\r\n\"tended the stock, took the horses to water, and ran errands for the\r\nfamily, and in return for such services the good lady, finding him an\r\nintelligent, active youth, was pleased to teach him his alphabet and\r\nreading.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1736 Cook's father was appointed to the position of hind or bailiff by\r\nMr. Skottowe, and removed with his family to Airy Holme Farm, near Ayton. According to Besant, a hind was one who, residing on a farm, was paid a\r\nregular wage for carrying on the work, and handed over the proceeds to\r\nthe landlord. Young James, now eight years of age, was sent to the school\r\non the High Green kept by a Mr. Pullen, where he was instructed in\r\nwriting and arithmetic as far as the first few rules--\"reading having\r\napparently been acquired before.\" He is said to have shown a special\r\naptitude for arithmetic, and it is believed that owing to the good\r\nreports of his progress, Mr. Skottowe paid for his schooling.

STAITHES. Most authorities say that Cook was bound apprentice to Mr. Saunderson, a\r\ngrocer and haberdasher of Staithes, at the age of thirteen; but Mrs. Dodds, Saunderson's daughter, told Dr. Young that, after leaving school,\r\nhe remained on the farm, helping his father, till 1745, when he was\r\nseventeen years old and then went to Staithes to her father on a verbal\r\nagreement without indentures, and would thus be free to leave or be\r\ndischarged at any time. The shop and house where he was engaged was situated about three hundred\r\nyards from the present slipway, and close to the sea, in fact so close\r\nthat in 1812 it was threatened by the water, and was pulled down by\r\nSaunderson's successor, Mr. John Smailey, and the materials, as far as\r\npossible, were used in erecting the building in Church Street which is\r\nnow pointed out as Cook's Shop. The late Mr. Waddington of Grosmont, near\r\nWhitby, says he visited Staithes in 1887 and found the original site\r\ncovered by deep water. He was informed by an old man, who, as a boy, had\r\nassisted in removing the stock from the old shop, that not only were the\r\nstones used again in Church Street, but also most of the woodwork,\r\nincluding the present door with its iron knocker, at which, probably,\r\nCook himself had knocked many a time. At Staithes Cook remained as Saunderson's assistant for about eighteen\r\nmonths, and it may easily be imagined how this growing lad listened with\r\nall his ears to the tales of the old sailors recalling brave deeds and\r\nstrange experiences in storm and shine on that element which for so many\r\nyears was to be his home, and at length, impelled by some instinctive\r\nfeeling that on it lay the path ready at his feet to lead him on to\r\nfuture distinction, he vowed to himself that he would not bind down his\r\nlife to the petty round of a country storekeeper. At length the opportunity came, which is related, in a breezy and\r\nlife-like manner, by Besant as follows. After painting Saunderson's\r\ncharacter in colours of a rather disagreeable hue, as one too fond of his\r\ngrog for himself and his stick for his apprentices, he says that Cook\r\nstole a shilling out of the till, packed up his luggage in a single\r\npocket-handkerchief, ran away across the moors to Whitby, found a ship on\r\nthe point of sailing, jumped on board, offered his services as cabin boy,\r\nwas at once accepted, showed himself so smart and attentive that he\r\ncompletely won the heart of the sour-visaged mate, and through his good\r\ngraces was eventually bound apprentice to the owners of the ship, and\r\nthus laid the foundation of his fortunes. This account does not explain\r\nhow it was that the dishonest runaway apprentice it depicts continued to\r\nretain the friendship and esteem of his master and Mrs. Dodds. APPRENTICED TO THE SEA. There undoubtedly was a difficulty about a shilling, and Dr. Young's\r\nversion, gathered from those who knew Cook personally and lived in\r\nStaithes and Whitby at the time, is more probable. He says that Cook had\r\nnoticed a South Sea shilling, and being struck by the unusual design (it\r\nwas only coined in 1723), changed it for one of his own. Saunderson had\r\nalso noticed it, and when he missed it, enquired for it perhaps in\r\nsomewhat unmeasured terms, but, on the matter being explained, was fully\r\nsatisfied.

The period of\r\napprenticeship was, on the authority of Messrs. John and Henry Walker,\r\nthree years, and not either seven or nine as is usually stated, and the\r\ndifficulty about being apprenticed to both Saunderson and Walker is, of\r\ncourse, set at rest by Mrs. Dodd's explanation. Whitby was at the time a very important centre of the coasting trade, and\r\npossessed several shipbuilding yards of good reputation, and it was in a\r\nWhitby-built ship, the Freelove, that Cook made his first voyage. She was\r\na vessel of about 450 tons (some 80 tons larger than the celebrated Bark\r\nEndeavour), was employed in the coal trade up and down the east coast,\r\nand no doubt Cook picked up many a wrinkle of seamanship and many a\r\nlesson of the value of promptitude in the time of danger which would\r\nprove of service when he came to the days of independent command: for the\r\nNorth Sea has, from time immemorial, been reckoned a grand school from\r\nwhich to obtain true sailormen for the Royal Service. As usual in those days, Cook stayed in his employer's house in the\r\nintervals between his trips, and his time ashore was longer during the\r\nwinter months as the ships were generally laid up. The house in Grape\r\nStreet, at present occupied by Mr. Braithwaite, is pointed out as the one\r\nwhere he lived whilst with Mr. Walker; but this is incorrect, for Mr. Waddington ascertained from the rate books that Mr. Walker's mother was\r\nliving there at that time, and Mr. Walker lived in Haggargate from 1734\r\nto 1751, removing thence to the north side of Bakehouse Yard in that\r\nyear, and to Grape Street in 1752, after his mother's death. That is, he\r\ndid not reside in Grape Street till three years after Cook's\r\napprenticeship was ended, when, following the usual custom, he would have\r\nto fend for himself. During these periods of leisure between his voyages,\r\nCook endeavoured to improve his store of knowledge, and it is believed he\r\nreceived some instruction in elementary navigation. He made great friends\r\nwith Mr. Walker's housekeeper, Mary Prowd, from whom he obtained the\r\nconcession of a table and a light in a quiet corner away from the others,\r\nwhere he might read and write in peace. That he worked hard to improve\r\nhimself is evident from the fact that Mr. Walker pushed him on at every\r\nopportunity, and gave him as varied an experience of things nautical as\r\nlay in his power. After several voyages in the Freelove (which is stated by the Yorkshire\r\nGazette to have been \"lost, together with one hundred and fifty\r\npassengers and the winter's supply of gingerbread for Whitby, off either\r\nthe French or Dutch coast\" one stormy Christmas, the date not given) Cook\r\nwas sent to assist in rigging and fitting for sea a vessel, called the\r\nThree Brothers, some 600 tons burden, which was still in existence\r\ntowards the close of last century. When she was completed, Cook made two\r\nor three trips in her with coals, and then she was employed for some\r\nmonths as a transport for troops from Middleburg to Dublin and Liverpool. She was paid off by the Government at Deptford in the spring of 1749, and\r\nthen traded to Norway, during which time Cook completed his\r\napprenticeship, that is, in July 1749. Cook told the naturalist of the\r\nsecond South Sea voyage, Mr. Forster, that on one of his trips to Norway\r\nthe rigging of the ship was completely covered with birds that had been\r\ndriven off the land by a heavy gale, and amongst them were several hawks\r\nwho made the best of their opportunities with the small birds. OFFERED COMMAND. When his apprenticeship had expired he went before the mast for about\r\nthree years.

This was rapid promotion for a\r\nyouth with nothing to back him up but his own exertions and strict\r\nattention to duty, and tends to prove that he had taken full advantage of\r\nthe opportunities that fell in his way, and had even then displayed a\r\npower of acquiring knowledge of his profession beyond the average. About this time Cook's father seems to have given up his position at Airy\r\nHolme Farm and turned his attention to building.

More convincing information still\r\nis to be found in the Leeds Mercury of 27th October 1883, where Mr. George Markham Tweddell, of Stokesley, writes:\r\n\r\n\"I may mention that Captain Cook's father was not the illiterate man he\r\nhas been represented; and I have, lying on my study table as I write, a\r\ndeed bearing his signature, dated 1755; and the father's signature bears\r\na resemblance to that of his distinguished son.\"\r\n\r\nReading is invariably learnt before writing, and as in 1755 the old man\r\nwas sixty-one, it is evident he did not wait till he was eighty to learn\r\nto read.

It must be remembered that this act of\r\nleaving employment which, to most men of his position, would have seemed\r\nmost satisfactory, was not the act of hot-headed youth, no step taken in\r\nmere spirit of adventure, but the calmly reasoned act of a man of\r\ntwenty-seven years and some eight or nine years experience of both the\r\nrough and smooth sides of maritime life. Several letters were written to Mr. Walker, one or two of which relating\r\nto a later period were seen and copied by Dr. Young, but they fell into\r\nthe hand of a niece, who unfortunately, not recognising their value,\r\ndestroyed them shortly before her death, which occurred some years ago. However, it is certain that he wrote one about this time and evidently\r\nreceived a favourable reply, for he shortly afterwards wrote again\r\nacknowledging the service done him. ENTERS NAVY. Having made up his mind how to proceed, Cook went to a rendezvous at\r\nWapping and volunteered into H.M.S. Eagle, a fourth-rate, 60-gun ship,\r\nwith a complement of 400 men and 56 marines, at that time moored in\r\nPortsmouth Harbour. On the Muster Roll, preserved in the Records Office,\r\nthe following entry occurs: \"161 from London rendezvous, James Cook,\r\nA.B., entry, June 17th 1755, first appearance June 25th 1755.\" On the\r\n24th July, that is, thirty-seven days after the date of entry into the\r\nNavy, he is rated as Master's mate, a position he held till 30th June\r\n1757, when he quitted H.M.S. Eagle. His appointment was facilitated by the difficulty experienced in\r\nobtaining men for the Service, as may be gathered from Captain Hamar's\r\nletters, who writes applying to the Admiralty for permission to break up\r\nhis London Rendezvous, as he says it has \"procured very few men, and\r\nthose only landsmen.\" Again, he complains of the quality of the men he\r\nhas received, and says he is one hundred and forty short of his\r\ncomplement. In another letter:\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe there is a worse man'd ship in the Navy. Yesterday I\r\nreceived from the Bristol twenty-five supernumeraries belonging to\r\ndifferent ships, but not one seaman among them: but, on the contrary, all\r\nvery indifferent Landsmen.\"\r\n\r\nThese complaints were endorsed by Captain Pallisser, who succeeded Hamar\r\non the Eagle, for he wrote that some of the crew were turned over from\r\nship to ship so often that he was quite unable to make out their original\r\none:\r\n\r\n\"they being such that none choose to own them.

PALLISSER COMMANDS. On the 1st July the Eagle was ordered to fit and provision for the\r\nLeeward Islands, but having received 62 men and 53 marines, the orders\r\nwere changed to cruise between Scilly and Cape Clear, and she sailed on\r\nthe 4th August.

This he did on the 1st October, and sailed\r\nfrom Plymouth on the 7th, and after cruising about in the Channel and\r\nmaking a few small captures he returned on the 22nd November, remaining\r\ntill the 13th March; and during this time Cook had a short spell of\r\nsickness, but it can hardly be called serious, as he was only in hospital\r\nfor ten days, being back to his duty on the 17th February.

Cook took her into Plymouth Sound, and he and his five men went on board\r\nthe St. Albans, and in her rejoined his own ship on the 2nd May, and then\r\nreturned to Plymouth on the 4th June. Pallisser, in reporting his arrival\r\nto the Secretary of the Admiralty, said that he had:\r\n\r\n\"put ashore to the hospital 130 sick men, most of which are extremely\r\nill: buried in the last month twenty-two.

DUC D'AQUITAINE. After another short cruise the Eagle returned to Plymouth with Pallisser\r\nvery ill with fever. He obtained sick leave, and Captain Proby was\r\nordered to take command, but was detained so long in the Downs by\r\ncontrary winds that Pallisser, who had heard a rumour of a French\r\nsquadron having been seen in the Channel, shook off his fever and resumed\r\nthe command of his ship, which was almost ready for sea. Every part of\r\nthe Channel mentioned in the rumour was carefully searched, but no signs\r\nof the enemy were seen, and the author of the report, a Swede, was\r\ndetained in Portsmouth for some months. On the 19th November the Eagle's crew was increased to 420 men, and she\r\nwas kept cruising throughout the winter, and on the 4th January 1757 she\r\nwas caught in a heavy gale off the Isle of Wight, where she had most of\r\nher sails blown out of her. On 25th May she sailed from Plymouth Sound in\r\ncompany with H.M.S.

After a hard set-to, lasting about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, the Frenchman struck, having lost 50 men\r\nkilled and 30 wounded, whilst the Eagle lost 10 killed and 80 wounded;\r\nand the list of damages to the ship reported to the Admiralty shows that\r\nthe action was sharp though short. The Medway was only able to afford\r\nassistance by firing a few raking shots, and suffered no damage except\r\nhaving ten men wounded by an accidental explosion of gunpowder. The masts\r\nand sails of the prize were so much damaged that she lost them all in the\r\nnight; one of the masts in falling sank the Medway's cutter.

The Duc d'Aquitaine was\r\npurchased for the Navy, and was entered under her own name as a\r\nthird-rate, 64 gun ship, with a complement of 500 men.

According to Dr. Kippis, Mr. Walker had interested the Member for Scarborough, Mr. Osbaldiston, on the subject of Cook's promotion, but the rule was that\r\ncandidates for Lieutenancy must have been employed on board a king's ship\r\nfor a period of not less than six years, and an order had recently been\r\nissued that this regulation was to be strictly adhered to. Captain\r\nPallisser therefore wrote to Mr. Osbaldiston that Cook:\r\n\r\n\"had been too short a time in the service for a commission, but that a\r\nMaster's warrant might be given him, by which he would be raised to a\r\nstation that he was well qualified to discharge with ability and credit.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this correspondence is shown in the Eagle's muster roll,\r\nfor on 27th June James Cook attended his last muster, and on the 30th he\r\nwas discharged.

At this point all the writers on Captain Cook have been led into error by\r\nfollowing the lead of Dr. Kippis. Everyone (with the single exception of\r\nLord Brougham, who by an evident slip of the pen puts him on board the\r\nMersey) writes that he was appointed Master of H.M.S. Mercury, and that\r\nhe joined the fleet of Admiral Saunders in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at\r\nthe time of the capture of Quebec in that ship. From the Public Records\r\nit has been ascertained that the Mercury was not in the Gulf of St. Lawrence with Saunders, but in the latter half of 1759 was sent to New\r\nYork, thence to Boston, and was at Spithead in April the following year. The same source also shows that not only was the Circumnavigator never on\r\nboard the Mercury in any capacity, but in all probability he never even\r\nsaw her. He is also said to have been Master's mate on the Pembroke, and\r\nDr. Kippis has him appointed to three different ships on three\r\nconsecutive days: the Grampus, but she sailed before Cook could join her;\r\nthe Garland, but she was found to have a Master when Cook joined; and,\r\nlastly, the Mercury. The explanation of this confusion as far as the Mercury is concerned (the\r\nrest was imagination) is that there was a second James Cook in the\r\nservice, who was appointed Master of the Mercury under a warrant dated\r\n15th May 1759 and entered on his duties immediately. He was with his ship\r\nat Sheerness on 12th July, at which time his namesake was before Quebec.", "sentences": ["The Medway was leading, but when getting close, had to bring to\r\nin order to clear for action, as otherwise she would be unable to open\r\nher lee ports.", "Pallisser, on the other hand, was all ready, and pressed\r\non, bringing the chase to action.", "After a hard set-to, lasting about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, the Frenchman struck, having lost 50 men\r\nkilled and 30 wounded, whilst the Eagle lost 10 killed and 80 wounded;\r\nand the list of damages to the ship reported to the Admiralty shows that\r\nthe action was sharp though short.", "The Medway was only able to afford\r\nassistance by firing a few raking shots, and suffered no damage except\r\nhaving ten men wounded by an accidental explosion of gunpowder.", "The masts\r\nand sails of the prize were so much damaged that she lost them all in the\r\nnight; one of the masts in falling sank the Medway's cutter.", "It was found\r\nshe had a complement of 493 men, and was armed with 50 guns.", "She had\r\nlanded her East Indian cargo at Lisbon, and then proceeded to cruise for\r\nfourteen days on the look-out for an English convoy sailing in charge of\r\nH.M.S.", "Mermaid.", "She had succeeded in picking up one prize, an English\r\nbrig, which was ransomed for 200 pounds.", "This was Cook's first experience\r\nof an important naval action, and Pallisser was complimented by the Lords\r\nof the Admiralty for his gallant conduct.", "The Duc d'Aquitaine was\r\npurchased for the Navy, and was entered under her own name as a\r\nthird-rate, 64 gun ship, with a complement of 500 men.", "The Eagle returned with her consort and her prize to Plymouth, and soon\r\nafterwards Cook's connection with her came to an end.", "According to Dr.", "Kippis, Mr.", "Walker had interested the Member for Scarborough, Mr.", "Osbaldiston, on the subject of Cook's promotion, but the rule was that\r\ncandidates for Lieutenancy must have been employed on board a king's ship\r\nfor a period of not less than six years, and an order had recently been\r\nissued that this regulation was to be strictly adhered to.", "Captain\r\nPallisser therefore wrote to Mr.", "Osbaldiston that Cook:\r\n\r\n\"had been too short a time in the service for a commission, but that a\r\nMaster's warrant might be given him, by which he would be raised to a\r\nstation that he was well qualified to discharge with ability and credit.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this correspondence is shown in the Eagle's muster roll,\r\nfor on 27th June James Cook attended his last muster, and on the 30th he\r\nwas discharged.", "The succeeding rolls registering \"D.", "30th June 1757.", "Solebay prefmnt.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MERCURY COOK.", "At this point all the writers on Captain Cook have been led into error by\r\nfollowing the lead of Dr.", "Kippis.", "Everyone (with the single exception of\r\nLord Brougham, who by an evident slip of the pen puts him on board the\r\nMersey) writes that he was appointed Master of H.M.S.", "Mercury, and that\r\nhe joined the fleet of Admiral Saunders in the Gulf of St.", "Lawrence at\r\nthe time of the capture of Quebec in that ship.", "From the Public Records\r\nit has been ascertained that the Mercury was not in the Gulf of St.", "Lawrence with Saunders, but in the latter half of 1759 was sent to New\r\nYork, thence to Boston, and was at Spithead in April the following year.", "The same source also shows that not only was the Circumnavigator never on\r\nboard the Mercury in any capacity, but in all probability he never even\r\nsaw her.", "He is also said to have been Master's mate on the Pembroke, and\r\nDr.", "Kippis has him appointed to three different ships on three\r\nconsecutive days: the Grampus, but she sailed before Cook could join her;\r\nthe Garland, but she was found to have a Master when Cook joined; and,\r\nlastly, the Mercury.", "The explanation of this confusion as far as the Mercury is concerned (the\r\nrest was imagination) is that there was a second James Cook in the\r\nservice, who was appointed Master of the Mercury under a warrant dated\r\n15th May 1759 and entered on his duties immediately.", "He was with his ship\r\nat Sheerness on 12th July, at which time his namesake was before Quebec."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_9", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 9)", "language": "it", "content": "On the return of the Mercury from Boston her Master was returned for some\r\ntime as \"sick on shore,\" and on 11th June 1760 was superseded by one John\r\nEmerton.

He was with his new ship at the recapture of St. John's,\r\nNewfoundland, in 1762, with John Jervis, afterwards Lord St. Vincent, as\r\nhis Captain. In 1765 he was on the Wolf on the Jamaica station, and was\r\nselected by Admiral Burnaby to carry despatches to the Governor of\r\nYucatan. This duty he successfully carried out, and in 1796 published a\r\npamphlet describing his adventures during the journey. On his return to\r\nEngland he applied to the Duke of Newcastle for the command of a cutter,\r\nand the letter is now in the British Museum, having been included in a\r\ncollection in mistake for one written by his celebrated namesake. There\r\nis a certain similarity in the writing, but in the signature he writes\r\nthe Christian name as Jas, whilst Captain Cook usually wrote Jams. The\r\nMercury Cook was lieutenant of the Speedwell in 1773, and having had some\r\nproperty left him in Jersey he received leave of absence in August. He\r\nnever rose above lieutenant, and disappears from the Navy List after July\r\n1800.

Cook joined H.M.S. Solebay on the 30th July 1757 at Leith, where she was\r\nthen stationed, but the date of his warrant has not been ascertained,\r\nalthough the Public Records and Trinity House have both been searched for\r\nthe purpose. His stay was not long, for after a cruise of a few days she\r\nreturned to Leith, and on 17th September Cook was superseded by John\r\nNichols; in fact, his time on board was so short that his signature is\r\nnot appended to any of the rolls. In April 1757 Mr. Bissett, who was Master of the Eagle when Cook was\r\nMaster's mate, and who therefore would have a better chance than any one\r\nelse to measure his subordinate's character and capabilities, was\r\nappointed Master of H.M.S. Pembroke, a new ship, and superintended her\r\nfitting for sea. On 26th October he found himself transferred to the\r\nStirling Castle, and it is only reasonable to suppose that, having formed\r\na high opinion of Cook's work, and knowing of his ambition to rise in the\r\nservice, he would give information of the opportunity and, as far as he\r\ncould, push forward his friend's interests. At any rate, the Muster Rolls\r\nshow that in less than six weeks from leaving the Solebay, Cook was\r\nestablished on board the Pembroke as Master, under a warrant bearing date\r\n18th October 1757, and entered upon his duties on 27th October, the\r\ntwenty-ninth anniversary of his birth; and from that date to his\r\ndischarge into the Northumberland he signed the usual documents. At the\r\ntime of his joining, the ship was fitting and victualling for sea at\r\nPortsmouth, and on 8th November she sailed for the Bay of Biscay, under\r\nthe command of Captain Simcoe, returning to Plymouth on 9th February\r\n1758. LOUISBERG. The British Government had decided on making a determined effort to wrest\r\nthe Colony of New France from the hands of the French, and one of the few\r\nsteps was to attempt the capture of the port of Louisburg, at the\r\nentrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence; a place which the enemy were said\r\nto have rendered almost impregnable at an expenditure of some million and\r\na quarter pounds.

Boscawen sailed with his\r\nfleet, one member of which was the Pembroke, for Halifax, where they\r\narrived, via Madeira and the Bermudas, on 8th May. Having completed his arrangements, Boscawen left Halifax on 28th May with\r\n17 sail of the Royal Navy and 127 transports, picking up 2 more\r\nmen-of-war and 8 transports just outside, and a couple more of the latter\r\na few hours later. He had to leave behind at Halifax, with orders to\r\nrejoin him as soon as they were fit, several ships, the Pembroke being\r\none, as their crews were so weakened by scurvy during the voyage from\r\nEngland. The Pembroke had lost 29 men, but was sufficiently recovered to\r\nbe able to sail with 3 transports, 2 schooners, and a cattle sloop on 7th\r\nJune, and arrived off Louisburg on the 12th, four days too late to take\r\npart in the landing which had been successfully carried out in the face\r\nof great difficulties caused by the roughness of the weather, the rocky\r\ncoast, and the opposition of the enemy. In fact, James Wolfe, who was a\r\nBrigadier throughout the siege, and on whose shoulders a very large\r\nportion of the work seems to have fallen, says: \"Our landing was next to\r\nmiraculous.\" There were 3 officers and 49 men killed; 5 officers and 59\r\nmen wounded of the army; 11 men killed, and 4 officers and 29 men wounded\r\nof the navy; and 19 men wounded of the transport service. The weather was\r\nso bad that no stores or artillery could be landed for several days, the\r\nfirst gun being got ashore on the 16th, so Cook was in plenty of time to\r\ntake his share in the difficult task of landing supplies; a task so\r\ndangerous that the fleet lost one hundred boats in this duty alone. As\r\nwell as forming the supply base for the army, the fleet also provided 583\r\nmen to act as gunners and engineers ashore; but none of these were from\r\nthe Pembroke. The nature of the ground rendered the work of constructing\r\nthe approaches and batteries extremely difficult, and it was not till\r\n20th June that the first gun opened fire. Wolfe formed a battery on\r\nLighthouse Point, one side of the entrance to the harbour whilst the town\r\nwas on the other side, with a fortified island in between; and the\r\nharbour held a French fleet which, at the time of the arrival of the\r\nBritish, consisted of nine men-of-war. One escaped on the very day of the\r\nlanding, and was shortly afterwards followed by two more. One L'Echo, was\r\ncaptured by Sir Charles Hardy, and was taken into the British Navy;\r\nwhilst the other, though chased for some distance, made good its escape\r\nto L'Orient with the first news of the siege. Previously to the coming of\r\nthe British, two ships had been sunk in the harbour's mouth to render\r\nentrance therein difficult; two more were added to these, and then a\r\nfifth.

He divided the transports into two divisions, the Starboard\r\nflying a red flag, and the Larboard a white one: he assigned to each\r\nvessel its position and duties, and pointed out to each Master of a hired\r\ntransport that if the orders of his officers were not promptly and\r\nexactly carried out they would be fired on, adding with a touch of grim\r\nhumour that the cost of the powder and shot so expended would be\r\ncarefully noted and charged against the hire of the offending ship. On\r\nthe 6th June Saunders was off Newfoundland with 22 men-of-war and 119\r\ntransports, and the cold winds blowing off the snow-covered hills of that\r\nisland were severely felt by the troops. On the 18th, when off the Island\r\nof Bic, they were joined by Wolfe in the Richmond, and five days after\r\npicked up Durell at the Ile aux Coudres. Here Saunders transferred his\r\nflag to the Stirling Castle, which he had selected in England for the\r\npurpose, owing to her handiness (Cook's friend, Mr. Bissett, was still on\r\nboard), and leaving Durell with eleven of the deepest draught to guard\r\nagainst any interference from a French fleet, he proceeded up the river\r\nwith the remainder. The work was hard, constantly anchoring and weighing\r\nto take every advantage of wind and tide, and the progress was slow; but\r\nat length the whole of the ships passed the Traverse, and on the 26th the\r\nfleet anchored off St. Laurent, on the Ile d'Orleans, and the troops were\r\nlanded on the following day. Thus the much-dreaded passage up the St. Lawrence had been carried out, and the fact that no loss of any kind had\r\noccurred to either man-of-war or transport, reflects the very greatest\r\ncredit on all engaged in the operation. Knox relates how the Master of\r\nthe transport he was on, a Brother of Trinity House and Thames pilot,\r\nnamed Killick, refused the services of a French prisoner as pilot, and\r\nobserving, \"Damme, I'll show them an Englishman can go where a Frenchman\r\ndar'n't show his nose,\" took his ship up himself, chaffing the occupants\r\nof the mark boats as he passed, and in the end declared that it was no\r\nworse than the Thames. The wonderful success of their passage was emphasised the afternoon after\r\ntheir arrival at St. Laurent when a heavy gale struck the fleet, driving\r\nseveral ships into collision or ashore, and causing considerable loss in\r\nanchors and cables. As soon as possible the men-of-war boats were out\r\nrendering every assistance, and all the vessels were secured but two,\r\nwhich were too firmly fixed to be towed off shore, and these were soon\r\nafterwards burnt by the enemy. FIREWORKS. Thinking to profit by the disorder which must necessarily have been\r\ncaused by the storm, the French made a determined attempt to destroy the\r\nfleet by means of eight fireships which were floated down stream on the\r\nunsuspecting British. Fortunately they were ignited prematurely, and the\r\nboats of the Pembroke and other ships were again out, employed in the\r\nhazardous task of towing these undesired visitors into such places as\r\nwould permit them to burn themselves out without danger to the shipping. Six were quickly got into safety, whilst the other two grounded and burnt\r\nout without causing further inconvenience. Captain Knox describes the\r\nscene as a display of \"the grandest fireworks that can possibly be\r\nconceived.\" The only result was to cause the retirement of a picket at\r\nthe western end of the Ile d'Orleans, and the officer in command, who\r\nthought he was about to be attacked in force, was to have been tried by\r\ncourt-martial, but being advised to throw himself on Wolfe's mercy, was\r\npardoned for his error of judgment.

He therefore pointed out to Wolfe that the\r\nsmall battery established by the French on Point Levi, which threatened\r\nany ship entering into the Basin, should be taken, and the Point\r\noccupied. This was at once carried out by Monckton's brigade, and a\r\nbattery was established which did serious damage to the town. When too\r\nlate the French sent over three floating batteries to aid in repulsing\r\nthe English, but they were driven back by one broadside from a frigate\r\nSaunders moved up for the purpose. Montcalm had entrenched his army on the north bank of the St. Lawrence,\r\nbetween the rivers Charles and Montmorenci, and Wolfe determined to seize\r\non a piece of high ground to the east of the Montmorenci, to form a camp\r\nthere, and endeavour to force on a general action. In pursuance of this\r\ndesign, a body of about 3000 men were landed successfully on 9th July,\r\nunder the protecting fire of some of the fleet, and a camp was formed,\r\nand the next few days provided employment for the boats of the Pembroke\r\nand other ships in landing men, stores, and artillery. The bombardment of\r\nthe town opened on 12th July from the batteries erected at Point Levi and\r\na portion of the fleet, and continued with little intermission till 13th\r\nSeptember. When fire was opened on the town other ships in the Basin and\r\nguns at the camp at Montmorenci opened on Montcalm's lines at Beauport. On the 18th two men-of-war, two armed sloops and two transports succeeded\r\nin passing the town without loss, but a third ship, the Diana, ran\r\naground in trying to avoid collision with a transport, and was attacked\r\nby the enemy's boats, but was brought off by the Pembroke and Richmond. She was so seriously damaged that she had to be sent to Boston for\r\nrepairs and then returned to England. On the 20th Wolfe joined the\r\nup-river squadron in a barge, and in passing the town had his mast\r\ncarried away by a shot from the Sillery Battery, but no further damage\r\nwas done. He made a short reconnaissance which led to nothing at the\r\ntime, but may have had an important influence in the choice of a\r\nlanding-place afterwards. ATTACK ON BEAUPORT. On his return to his camp at Montmorenci he decided to make an attack on\r\nthe left of the French lines from boats and from his camp over a ford\r\nwhich was available at low tide between the falls of Montmorenci and the\r\nSt. Lawrence. This attack was to be supported by the Centurion, moored in\r\nthe north channel, and by two armed cats which were to be run aground as\r\nnear as possible to some small redoubts, the first object of the attack. Here it is certain that Wolfe and Cook came into personal contact, for on\r\nthe latter fell the duty of taking the necessary soundings for the\r\nposition to be occupied by the cats, and Wolfe refers in a despatch to a\r\nconversation he had with Cook upon the matter. The attack took place on\r\n31st July, aided by the fire of the Pembroke, Trent, and Richmond, which\r\nwere \"anchored clear over to the north shore before Beauport, a brisk\r\nfiring on both sides,\" but the boats were thrown into confusion by a reef\r\n(marked on the chart as visible at low water), and were some time before\r\nthey could effect a landing, then a heavy storm of rain came on,\r\nrendering the ground, which was steep, very slippery. The troops occupied\r\none redoubt, but were so dominated by the French musketry that they could\r\nget no further, and Wolfe deemed it desirable to recall them and to stop\r\nthe advance across the ford. The two cats were burnt to prevent them\r\nfalling into the hands of the enemy, and the losses of the English in\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing were 443, those of the French being\r\nestimated at 200.", "sentences": ["An examination of the position showed Admiral Saunders that the safety of\r\nthe fleet, and therefore the interests of the army, would be best\r\nconsulted if he proceeded into the Basin of Quebec, as to remain cooped\r\nup in the south channel added to the danger if a further attempt should\r\nbe made to fire the fleet.", "He therefore pointed out to Wolfe that the\r\nsmall battery established by the French on Point Levi, which threatened\r\nany ship entering into the Basin, should be taken, and the Point\r\noccupied.", "This was at once carried out by Monckton's brigade, and a\r\nbattery was established which did serious damage to the town.", "When too\r\nlate the French sent over three floating batteries to aid in repulsing\r\nthe English, but they were driven back by one broadside from a frigate\r\nSaunders moved up for the purpose.", "Montcalm had entrenched his army on the north bank of the St.", "Lawrence,\r\nbetween the rivers Charles and Montmorenci, and Wolfe determined to seize\r\non a piece of high ground to the east of the Montmorenci, to form a camp\r\nthere, and endeavour to force on a general action.", "In pursuance of this\r\ndesign, a body of about 3000 men were landed successfully on 9th July,\r\nunder the protecting fire of some of the fleet, and a camp was formed,\r\nand the next few days provided employment for the boats of the Pembroke\r\nand other ships in landing men, stores, and artillery.", "The bombardment of\r\nthe town opened on 12th July from the batteries erected at Point Levi and\r\na portion of the fleet, and continued with little intermission till 13th\r\nSeptember.", "When fire was opened on the town other ships in the Basin and\r\nguns at the camp at Montmorenci opened on Montcalm's lines at Beauport.", "On the 18th two men-of-war, two armed sloops and two transports succeeded\r\nin passing the town without loss, but a third ship, the Diana, ran\r\naground in trying to avoid collision with a transport, and was attacked\r\nby the enemy's boats, but was brought off by the Pembroke and Richmond.", "She was so seriously damaged that she had to be sent to Boston for\r\nrepairs and then returned to England.", "On the 20th Wolfe joined the\r\nup-river squadron in a barge, and in passing the town had his mast\r\ncarried away by a shot from the Sillery Battery, but no further damage\r\nwas done.", "He made a short reconnaissance which led to nothing at the\r\ntime, but may have had an important influence in the choice of a\r\nlanding-place afterwards.", "ATTACK ON BEAUPORT.", "On his return to his camp at Montmorenci he decided to make an attack on\r\nthe left of the French lines from boats and from his camp over a ford\r\nwhich was available at low tide between the falls of Montmorenci and the\r\nSt.", "Lawrence.", "This attack was to be supported by the Centurion, moored in\r\nthe north channel, and by two armed cats which were to be run aground as\r\nnear as possible to some small redoubts, the first object of the attack.", "Here it is certain that Wolfe and Cook came into personal contact, for on\r\nthe latter fell the duty of taking the necessary soundings for the\r\nposition to be occupied by the cats, and Wolfe refers in a despatch to a\r\nconversation he had with Cook upon the matter.", "The attack took place on\r\n31st July, aided by the fire of the Pembroke, Trent, and Richmond, which\r\nwere \"anchored clear over to the north shore before Beauport, a brisk\r\nfiring on both sides,\" but the boats were thrown into confusion by a reef\r\n(marked on the chart as visible at low water), and were some time before\r\nthey could effect a landing, then a heavy storm of rain came on,\r\nrendering the ground, which was steep, very slippery.", "The troops occupied\r\none redoubt, but were so dominated by the French musketry that they could\r\nget no further, and Wolfe deemed it desirable to recall them and to stop\r\nthe advance across the ford.", "The two cats were burnt to prevent them\r\nfalling into the hands of the enemy, and the losses of the English in\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing were 443, those of the French being\r\nestimated at 200."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_15", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 15)", "language": "it", "content": "Cook says the repulse was solely owing to the heavy\r\nfire from the entrenchments, \"which soon obliged our Troops to retreat\r\nback to the Boats and Montmorency\";

A few days before this attack on Beauport was made, the French again paid\r\nthe fleet the undesired attention of a large fire raft composed of\r\nseveral small vessels chained together and laden with all sorts of\r\ncombustibles--shells, guns loaded to the muzzle, tar barrels, etc., and\r\nagain this was grappled by the boats and towed away to a place of safety;\r\nand then Wolfe, sending in a flag of truce the next morning, said that if\r\nthe performance were repeated he should cause the instrument of\r\ndestruction to be towed alongside two ships in which he had Canadian\r\nprisoners, and there let it do its worst. This somewhat cold-blooded\r\nthreat was sufficient, and the experiment was not repeated. A NARROW ESCAPE. During the time the fleet was occupying the Basin, the Masters of the\r\nships were constantly out making observations and sounding, partly for\r\nthe necessities of the fleet and partly to throw dust in the eyes of the\r\nFrench; and on one occasion Cook had a narrow escape from capture, his\r\nmen had to row for it to get away from the enemy, and reaching the Isle\r\nof Orleans landed just in time, for as Cook, the last man, sprang ashore\r\nfrom the bows an Indian boarded over the stern. The hospital picket\r\nturned out, and the French retreated. His friend, Mr. Bissett, was not so\r\nfortunate, being taken prisoner on 7th July whilst sounding in the north\r\nchannel; but he was either exchanged or escaped, for he was only absent\r\nfrom his ship for a few days. Wolfe, who was almost always ailing, had an attack of fever, and the\r\nworry of the repulse at Beauport rendered him incapable of duty for some\r\ndays; he therefore laid before his Brigadiers plans of future movements,\r\nasking their opinions and advice. These plans were not approved, but it\r\nwas suggested that an attempt should be made to land on the western side\r\nof the town and there bring the enemy to action, and Wolfe writes: \"I\r\nhave acquiesced in their Proposal, and we are preparing to put it into\r\nexecution.\"\r\n\r\nThe up-river detachment had been strengthened by the addition of a few\r\nmore vessels, and Murray with 1200 men had joined in an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to get at the French supply fleet which had retreated to a place\r\nof safety.

She sailed by in\r\nbroad daylight, drawing the fire of every gun that could be brought to\r\nbear on her, but was untouched, and, anchoring close alongside the\r\nAdmiral's ship, gave him a salute from the whole of her armament. The troops which had been quietly marched some distance up the south bank\r\nfrom Point Levi were taken on board the ships, the last detachment on the\r\nnight of the 12th; and Admiral Holmes sailed up the river as if to beat\r\nup the French communications, but when night fell he returned, and the\r\nlanding was successfully accomplished, and is described by Saunders in\r\nhis despatch as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The night of their landing, Admiral Holmes with the ships and troops was\r\nabout three leagues above the intended landing-place. General Wolfe with\r\nabout half his troops set off in the boats, and dropped down with the\r\ntide, and were by that means less liable to be discovered by the\r\nsentinels posted all along the coast. The ships followed them about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour afterwards, and got to the landing-place just\r\nat the time that had been concerted to cover the landing, and considering\r\nthe darkness of the night, and the rapidity of the current, this was a\r\nvery critical operation, and very properly and successfully conducted.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the ships in the Basin, some fifteen in number,\r\ndistracted the attention of the French by a heavy cannonade on the\r\nBeauport lines, and the boats made a feint as if an attack were\r\ncontemplated; buoys had been laid in such a way as to lead to the idea\r\nthat the ships were going to moor as close in as possible as if to\r\nsupport an assault, and every effort was made to draw attention away from\r\nthe movement up above. THE PLAINS OF ABRAHAM. Lieutenant Norman, of the Pembroke, shortly describes the battle in his\r\nlog:\r\n\r\n\"At 4 A.M. General Wolfe landed just below Cape Diamond with the whole\r\narmy. At 8 the signal of Boats man'd and arm'd to go to Point Levi,\r\nweighed and dropped hier up. About 10 the enemy march'd up and attacked\r\nGeneral Wolfe, the action lasted not 10 minutes before the Enemy gave way\r\nand run in the Greatest Confusion and left us a compleat Victuary. Our\r\nArmy encamped on the plain a back of the Town and made the necessary\r\ndisposition for carrying on ye siege. Admiral Holmes hoisted his flag on\r\nboard the Lowestaff, just off the Landing place.

CHAPTER 4. 1759 TO 1762. H.M.S. NORTHUMBERLAND. On the way down the river from Quebec, the fleet appears to have found\r\nthe passage very difficult, the dangers of the Channel being aggravated\r\nby the strength of the current and bad weather. The Captain, Vesuvius,\r\nand Royal William were aground for some time, but were ultimately got off\r\nagain without much damage; and the Terrible, which was drifting and in\r\ngreat danger, was only brought up by means of an anchor constructed for\r\nthe occasion by lashing one of the quarter-deck guns to two small\r\nanchors. When her large anchors were hauled up they were found to be\r\nbroken; and so great was the loss of these articles that Lord Colville\r\nwas obliged to press the Admiralty for a fresh supply to be sent out\r\nimmediately, as he found it impossible to replace those lost in the\r\nTraverse either at Boston or any other place in America. RELIEF OF QUEBEC. Colville's squadron arrived in Halifax on 27th October, Cook's\r\nthirty-first birthday, and as soon as the winter was over, and the ships\r\nwere cleaned and fitted for sea as well as the limited appliances would\r\npermit, it left for the St. Lawrence, sailing on 22nd April 1760, but was\r\n\"so retarded by frozen fogs, seas of compacted ice, and contrary winds,\"\r\nthat it did not arrive off the Ile de Bic before 16th May. Here they were\r\nmet by a sloop with the news that Quebec was in urgent need of help. General Murray, hearing of the approach of General de Levis, with a\r\nFrench force, had left the shelter of the forts, and notwithstanding he\r\nwas greatly outnumbered, had offered battle in the open. He had at first\r\nchosen a strong position, but hearing from spies that the French were\r\nbusy cleaning their arms after being caught in a heavy storm the night\r\nbefore, he advanced upon them, and owing to the sudden attack and the\r\nsuperiority of his artillery, at first gained a considerable advantage,\r\nbut afterwards the weight of numbers told, and the British were forced to\r\nretire to the town with sadly reduced numbers, and Quebec was again\r\nbesieged.

On 19th January 1761, Lord Colville records in his Journal that he had\r\n\"directed the storekeeper to pay the Master of the Northumberland, fifty\r\npounds in consideration of his indefatigable industry in making himself\r\nmaster of the pilotage of the River St. Lawrence.\" This is the first\r\nofficial recognition that has been found of the fact that Cook had gone\r\nbeyond the ordinary duties incumbent on every Master in His Majesty's\r\nService, namely: \"To observe all coasts, shoals, and rocks, taking\r\ncareful notes of the same.\" There is no record in any of the official\r\ndocuments that Cook was specially engaged in surveying the river, but it\r\nis very evident from this entry that he must have done the work during\r\nthe four months that his ship was moored in the Basin of Quebec.

Saunders, after his return\r\nto England, wrote to the Secretary of the Admiralty, on 22nd April 1760,\r\nsaying that he had, ready for publication, a Draught of the River St. Lawrence with its harbours, bays, and islands, and asked for their\r\nLordships' directions thereon.

On Saunders' chart there is a long note which\r\nconcludes:\r\n\r\n\"The distances between Isle Coudre and Isle of Orleans, the Pillar Rocks\r\nand Shoals in the south channel were accurately determined by triangles. The other parts of this chart were taken from the best French Draughts of\r\nthis River.\"\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if this triangulation could have been carried out by Cook\r\nduring his passage up and then down the river, the only time he had in\r\n1759, but if it were, it argues much greater knowledge of nautical\r\nsurveying than he is generally supposed to have had at the time.

He had been advised by despatches, dated 26th December 1761, that war had\r\nbeen declared with the latter nation. During this period of waiting the\r\nwords \"nothing remarkable\" are in constant use in Captain Adams's (the\r\nsecond Captain of the Northumberland) Journal. Cook utilised this time to\r\nmake a thorough survey of Halifax Harbour, the notes of which are now in\r\nthe United Service Museum, Whitehall. At length the period of inaction was ended. Captain Charles Douglas,\r\nH.M.S. Syren, who was cruising off Cape Race, received information that a\r\nsquadron of four French ships of the line, having some 1500 picked troops\r\non board, had made a descent on Newfoundland, and had captured St. John's, the capital, which had been most shamefully neglected, and its\r\ngarrison reduced to 63 men. The Grammont, 22-gun sloop, was unfortunately\r\nin harbour at the time, and was also taken. Douglas at once pressed two\r\nEnglish merchant vessels into the service, and putting a petty officer in\r\ncommand of one, the William, and his Master in the other, the Bonetta,\r\ndespatched them to cruise in search of Captain Graves, the reappointed\r\nGovernor of Newfoundland, who was daily expected from England. The\r\nBonetta soon fell in with the Antelope, Graves's ship, and she\r\nimmediately joined Douglas, and then proceeded to strengthen the Isle of\r\nBoys as far as time would allow. Then going to Placentia, a place of as\r\nmuch importance as St. John's, and more capable of defence, they set\r\nabout making preparations to beat off any attack, leaving a garrison of\r\n99 men and as many marines as could be spared. Graves then despatched\r\nDouglas with the remainder of the Syren's marines to take possession of\r\nFerryland, and sent the ship herself off with letters to Lord Colville,\r\nbut the William having missed the Antelope, made her way to Halifax with\r\nthe news of what had occurred. RECAPTURE OF ST. JOHN'S. Colville at once sent word to General Amherst, Commander-in-Chief in\r\nAmerica, asking him to forward any troops he could spare, and started,\r\naccompanied by the Gosport, and an armed colonial vessel, the King\r\nGeorge, 20 guns, to cruise off the Newfoundland coast in order to prevent\r\nthe arrival of French reinforcements or supplies. He met Graves at\r\nPlacentia on 14th August, and landed all the marines he could, and then\r\ncontinued his cruise. Amherst collected every available man from New\r\nYork, Halifax, and Louisberg, and putting them under the command of his\r\nbrother, Colonel William Amherst, ordered him to use every despatch and\r\njoin Lord Colville without delay. This the Colonel succeeded in doing on\r\n12th September off Cape Spear, and the next day they landed at Torbay,\r\nsome three leagues north of St. John's. They drove in the French outposts\r\nand took possession of a small harbour named Quidi Vidi, which had been\r\nblocked at the entrance by the French.

Thus after being blocked up in St. John's Harbour for three weeks by a squadron of equal number, but smaller\r\nships with fewer guns and men, M. de Ternay made his escape in the night\r\nby a shameful flight. I beg leave to observe that not a man in the\r\nsquadron imagined the four sail, when we saw them, were the enemy; and\r\nthe pilots were of opinion that they must have had the wind much stronger\r\nthan with us to overcome the easterly swell in the harbour's mouth. I\r\nsent the King George as far as Trepassy, to bring me intelligence if the\r\nenemy should steer towards Placentia; and I directed Captain Douglas of\r\nthe Syren to get the transports moved from Torbay, a very unsafe road, to\r\nthe Bay of Bulls.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as information was received in England that an expedition had\r\nbeen sent from France, the Admiralty despatched a squadron under Captain\r\nPallisser in pursuit, and as it arrived in St. John's only four days\r\nafter M. de Ternay left, they must have been very close to a meeting. COOK MEETS COOK. Whilst the movements leading up to the recapture of St. John's were being\r\ncarried on, communication between Colville and Amherst was kept up by the\r\nboats of the fleet under the charge of the third lieutenant of H.M.S. Gosport, Mr. James Cook, formerly Master of H.M.S. Mercury, who performed\r\nthis duty to the complete satisfaction of Lord Colville as signified in\r\nhis despatches to the Admiralty. It is certain, therefore, that the two\r\nnamesakes must have come face to face here, and most probably previously\r\nin Halifax Harbour. Entering St. John's Harbour on 19th September, the flagship remained till\r\n7th October, during which time Cook was very busily employed in assisting\r\nto place the island in a better state of defence. In a despatch of Lord\r\nColville's, dated \"Spithead, 25th October 1762,\" he says:\r\n\r\n\"I have mentioned in another letter, that the fortifications on the\r\nIsland of Carbonera were entirely destroyed by the enemy. Colonel Amherst\r\nsent thither Mr. Desbarres, an engineer, who surveyed the island and drew\r\na plan for fortifying it with new works: when these are finished the\r\nEnterprise's six guns will be ready to mount on them. But I believe\r\nnothing will be undertaken this year, as the season is so far advanced,\r\nand no kind of materials on the spot for building barracks or sheds for\r\ncovering the men, should any be sent there. Mr. Cook, Master of the\r\nNorthumberland, accompanied Mr. Desbarres. He has made a draught of\r\nHarbour Grace and the Bay of Carbonera, both of which are in a great\r\nmeasure commanded by the Island, which lies off a point of land between\r\nthem.

I am, sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nColville. MARRIAGE. Before the close of the year Cook took upon himself further\r\nresponsibilities as set forth in the following extract from the register\r\nof St. Margaret's Church, Barking, Essex:\r\n\r\n\"James Cook of ye Parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, in ye County of\r\nMiddlesex, Bachelor, and Elizabeth Batts, of ye parish of Barking in ye\r\nCounty of Essex, Spinster, were married in this Church by ye Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury's Licence, this 21st day of December, one thousand seven\r\nhundred and sixty-two, by George Downing, Vicar of Little Wakering,\r\nEssex.\"\r\n\r\nBesant, who obtained his information from Mrs. Cook's second cousin, the\r\nlate Canon Bennett, who as a boy knew her well, speaks most highly of her\r\nmental qualities and personal appearance, and says the union appears to\r\nhave been a very happy one. It covered a period of about sixteen years;\r\nbut taking into consideration the times he was away on duty, sometimes\r\nfor long periods, Cook's home life in reality only extended to a little\r\nmore than four years, and Mrs. Cook must often have been months,\r\nsometimes years, without even hearing of the existence of her husband. Her family were fairly well-to-do; her grandfather, Mr. Charles Smith,\r\nwas a currier in Bermondsey; her cousin, also Charles Smith, was a\r\nclockmaker of repute in Bunhill Row. Her mother, Mary Smith, married\r\nfirst John Batts of Wapping, and secondly, John Blackburn of Shadwell. Miss Batts is described as of Barking in the Marriage Register, so may\r\nperhaps have been living with relations there, and may have met Cook when\r\non a visit to her mother in Shadwell, where he was residing. The\r\nengagement must have been very short, for from the time of his joining\r\nthe Navy in 1755 to his return from Newfoundland in 1762, his leave on\r\nshore had been very limited, and, with the exception perhaps of a day or\r\ntwo between leaving the Eagle and joining the Solebay, and again when\r\nleaving the latter ship for the Pembroke, none of his time was spent in\r\nLondon.", "sentences": ["Cook, who was particularly careful in sounding them, has\r\ndiscovered that ships of any size may lie in safety both in Harbour Grace\r\nand the Bay of Carbonera.\"\r\n\r\nMr.", "Desbarres's design for the fortification of Carbonera, drawn by John\r\nChamberlain, dated 7th April 1763, is to be found in the British Museum;\r\nhe was afterwards Governor of Cape Breton.", "On the return of the Northumberland to Spithead, where she arrived on\r\n24th October, her Master, James Cook, was discharged, the Muster Roll\r\nmerely noting \"superseded\" on 11th November, and the pay sheet records\r\nthe deductions from his wages as: \"Chest, 2 pounds 1 shilling 0 pence;\r\nHospital, 1 pound 0 shillings 6 pence.", "Threepence in the pound, 3 pounds\r\n14 shillings 9 pence,\" leaving a balance due of 291 pounds 19 shillings 3\r\npence.", "He also received from Lord Colville for the Secretary to the\r\nAdmiralty the following letter which shows the estimation he was held in\r\nby his immediate superiors, and would doubtless be of weight when the\r\nappointment of a man to execute greater undertakings came under the\r\nconsideration of their Lordships.", "London, 30th December 1762.", "Sir,\r\n\r\nMr.", "Cook, late Master of the Northumberland, acquaints me that he has\r\nlaid before their Lordships all his draughts and observations relating to\r\nthe River St.", "Lawrence, part of the coast of Nova Scotia, and of\r\nNewfoundland.", "On this occasion I beg to inform their Lordships that from my experience\r\nof Mr.", "Cook's genius and capacity, I think him well qualified for the\r\nwork he has performed and for greater undertakings of the same kind.", "These draughts being made under my own eye, I can venture to say they may\r\nbe the means of directing many in the right way, but cannot mislead any.", "I am, sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nColville.", "MARRIAGE.", "Before the close of the year Cook took upon himself further\r\nresponsibilities as set forth in the following extract from the register\r\nof St.", "Margaret's Church, Barking, Essex:\r\n\r\n\"James Cook of ye Parish of St.", "Paul, Shadwell, in ye County of\r\nMiddlesex, Bachelor, and Elizabeth Batts, of ye parish of Barking in ye\r\nCounty of Essex, Spinster, were married in this Church by ye Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury's Licence, this 21st day of December, one thousand seven\r\nhundred and sixty-two, by George Downing, Vicar of Little Wakering,\r\nEssex.\"\r\n\r\nBesant, who obtained his information from Mrs.", "Cook's second cousin, the\r\nlate Canon Bennett, who as a boy knew her well, speaks most highly of her\r\nmental qualities and personal appearance, and says the union appears to\r\nhave been a very happy one.", "It covered a period of about sixteen years;\r\nbut taking into consideration the times he was away on duty, sometimes\r\nfor long periods, Cook's home life in reality only extended to a little\r\nmore than four years, and Mrs.", "Cook must often have been months,\r\nsometimes years, without even hearing of the existence of her husband.", "Her family were fairly well-to-do;

After their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Cook lived for a time in Shadwell, and\r\nthen removed to Mile End Old Town, where Cook purchased a house, which\r\nwas their home till after his death. This house, which he left to his\r\nwife, has been identified as Number 88 Mile End Road, and a tablet has\r\nbeen placed on the front to mark the fact. CHAPTER 5. 1763 TO 1767. NEWFOUNDLAND. The commission as Governor of Newfoundland, which now included Labrador\r\nfrom Hudson's Straits to the St. John's River, the island of Anticosti,\r\nthe islands off the Labrador coast, and the Madelines in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, had again been conferred on Captain (afterwards Admiral Lord)\r\nGraves. He had early recognised the fact that it was necessary to have a\r\nthorough survey of the coasts of his territory, and therefore made an\r\napplication to the Board of Trade to have the one commenced as far back\r\nas 1714 by Captain Taverner, but only carried on in a desultory fashion,\r\nput in hand and completed as quickly as possible. This application\r\nresulted in a Representation from the Board to His Majesty, dated 29th\r\nMarch 1763, to be found in the Shelbourne manuscripts, asking that an\r\nallowance should be made for the purpose. Graves had seen during the previous year the work done by Cook at Harbour\r\nGrace and Carbonera, and had evidently made up his mind that he had found\r\nthe man for his purpose, in which opinion he would be backed up by\r\nColville and further supported by the favourable knowledge that the\r\nAdmiralty had of his work. The Representation was immediately acted on,\r\nfor in the Records Office is a hurried note from Graves to Mr. Stephens,\r\nSecretary to the Admiralty, probably written on the 5th April, in which\r\nhe asks:\r\n\r\n\"what final answer he shall give to Mr. Cook, late Master of the\r\nNorthumberland, who is very willing to go out to survey the Harbours and\r\nCoasts of Labradore.\"\r\n\r\nA draughtsman is also mentioned, and one is recommended who was on the\r\nBellona and was willing to go out, ranking as schoolmaster; he did join\r\nCook after a time. On 6th April Graves again wrote to Stephens, telling\r\nhim he had instructed Cook to get ready to start as soon as the Board\r\ngave him orders, and that he was to have ten shillings per diem whilst\r\nemployed on that service. He also says that Cook had been to the Tower to\r\ntry to secure a draughtsman, and towards the end of the letter applies\r\nfor the instruments necessary to carry on the operations. Graves was\r\nhurriedly called away to his ship, the Antelope, as the spirit of\r\ndiscontent, then very rife in the Navy, was developing itself in a very\r\nthreatening manner during his absence. However, on his arrival on board,\r\nby judicious reforms, which he saw were carried out, and by quietly\r\nreplacing some few of the most dangerous of the malcontents, he was very\r\nshortly able to report himself ready for sea with a complete and fairly\r\ncontented crew. On 15th April he writes to Stephens asking if there was \"any change of\r\nresolution taken about Mr. Cook, the Master, and an assistant for him,\r\nand whether they are to go out with me?\" On the 18th he writes again,\r\nsaying that when in London he had been informed that he was to receive\r\norders to purchase two small vessels of about 60 tons each when he\r\narrived in Newfoundland, one of which he was \"to send with Mr. Cook upon\r\nthe surveys of the coast and harbours,\" but he was afraid the orders had\r\nbeen forgotten, and he again makes suggestions as to instruments, etc.,\r\nrequired for the work.", "sentences": ["There is a story that he was godfather to his wife, and at her\r\nbaptism vowed to marry her, but as at that time, 1741, Cook was assisting\r\nhis father on Airy Holme Farm, the tale is too absurd, but has for all\r\nthat been repeatedly published.", "After their marriage Mr.", "and Mrs.", "Cook lived for a time in Shadwell, and\r\nthen removed to Mile End Old Town, where Cook purchased a house, which\r\nwas their home till after his death.", "This house, which he left to his\r\nwife, has been identified as Number 88 Mile End Road, and a tablet has\r\nbeen placed on the front to mark the fact.", "CHAPTER 5.", "1763 TO 1767.", "NEWFOUNDLAND.", "The commission as Governor of Newfoundland, which now included Labrador\r\nfrom Hudson's Straits to the St.", "John's River, the island of Anticosti,\r\nthe islands off the Labrador coast, and the Madelines in the Gulf of St.", "Lawrence, had again been conferred on Captain (afterwards Admiral Lord)\r\nGraves.", "He had early recognised the fact that it was necessary to have a\r\nthorough survey of the coasts of his territory, and therefore made an\r\napplication to the Board of Trade to have the one commenced as far back\r\nas 1714 by Captain Taverner, but only carried on in a desultory fashion,\r\nput in hand and completed as quickly as possible.", "This application\r\nresulted in a Representation from the Board to His Majesty, dated 29th\r\nMarch 1763, to be found in the Shelbourne manuscripts, asking that an\r\nallowance should be made for the purpose.", "Graves had seen during the previous year the work done by Cook at Harbour\r\nGrace and Carbonera, and had evidently made up his mind that he had found\r\nthe man for his purpose, in which opinion he would be backed up by\r\nColville and further supported by the favourable knowledge that the\r\nAdmiralty had of his work.", "The Representation was immediately acted on,\r\nfor in the Records Office is a hurried note from Graves to Mr.", "Stephens,\r\nSecretary to the Admiralty, probably written on the 5th April, in which\r\nhe asks:\r\n\r\n\"what final answer he shall give to Mr.", "Cook, late Master of the\r\nNorthumberland, who is very willing to go out to survey the Harbours and\r\nCoasts of Labradore.\"\r\n\r\nA draughtsman is also mentioned, and one is recommended who was on the\r\nBellona and was willing to go out, ranking as schoolmaster;

COOK'S SAILING ORDERS. On 19th April Cook received his orders as follows:\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, having directed Captain Graves,\r\nof His Majesty's Ship, the Antelope, at Portsmouth, to receive you on\r\nboard and carry you to Newfoundland in order to your taking a Survey of\r\nPart of the Coast and Harbours of that Island. I am commanded by their\r\nLordships to acquaint you therewith: that you must repair immediately on\r\nboard the said ship, she being under sailing orders, that you are to\r\nfollow such orders as you shall receive from Captain Graves relative to\r\nthe said service and that you will be allowed ten shillings a day during\r\nthe time you are employed therein. I am, etc. etc., PHILLIP STEPHENS. Mr. James Cook, ---- Town. Mr. William Test, Tower, to be paid 6 shillings per day. On 8th May Graves acknowledged the receipt of the orders he had asked\r\nfor, authorising him to purchase two small vessels, and announced that\r\nMr. Cook had joined the ship, but that the assistant, Mr. Test, had not\r\nbeen heard of; he therefore proposed that he should endeavour to obtain\r\nsomeone else to fill the vacancy. Mr. Stephens replied that a difficulty\r\nhad arisen with the Board of Ordnance with regard to Mr. Test's pay; they\r\nwere not inclined to continue it during his absence as they would have to\r\nput some one else in his place, and since hearing this, as the Admiralty\r\nhad heard nothing further from Mr. Test, Captain Graves was authorised to\r\nfill the vacancy at a suitable allowance, and he at once secured the\r\nservices of Mr. Edward Smart, who sailed from Plymouth in H.M.S. Spy, and\r\njoined Cook in Newfoundland. In this letter Graves also says that he intends to start Cook on the\r\nsurvey of St. Pierre and Miquelon as they had to be handed over to the\r\nFrench under treaty, whilst he should make some stay upon the coast in\r\norder to afford proper time for survey before they had to be surrendered. The possession of these islands carried with it certain fishing and\r\ncuring rights conferred by the Treaty of Utrecht and confirmed by that of\r\nParis, and the possession of the islands and rights have been a continual\r\ncause of irritation to the fishermen of both nations till lately, but now\r\nthe differences have been satisfactorily settled. It is said that the\r\nEarl of Bute was the cause of the inclusion of the clause concerning\r\nthese islands in the Treaty, and that he received the sum of 300,000\r\npounds for permitting it to stand. It was specially stipulated that the\r\nislands were not to be fortified, and the number of the garrison was to\r\nbe strictly limited to a number sufficient for police duty alone; but\r\nfrom the very commencement of the peace, it was one continual struggle to\r\nevade the terms by one side, and to enforce them by the other, without\r\ncoming to an actual rupture. JUDICIOUS PROCRASTINATION. According to his expressed intention, Captain Graves, on arriving at St. John's, despatched Captain Charles Douglas in the Tweed to superintend\r\nthe removal of the British settlers from the two islands, and Cook\r\naccompanied him with orders to press on the survey as rapidly as possible\r\nin order that it might be completed before the arrival of the French. Unfortunately, M. d'Anjac, who was charged with the duty of receiving the\r\nislands on behalf of the French king, arrived on the same day as the\r\nTweed, off the islands.

On receipt of this letter Pallisser wrote\r\nto Cook, and this communication, together with autograph copies of\r\nletters written by Cook having reference to the Grenville, a receipt for\r\nher husband's pay, signed by Mrs. Cook, and some other papers of interest\r\nrelating to his voyages, are now in the hands of Mr. Alexander Turnbull,\r\nof Wellington, New Zealand. It would appear that it was at this time that the friendship between\r\nPallisser and Cook really commenced, for previously there can have been\r\nno opportunity for the former to have known anything of Cook's\r\npersonality. A Captain of a man-of-war saw nothing of a Master's mate,\r\nand knew nothing of him except whether he did his duty or not, and that\r\nonly through the Master's report. In this particular case, as soon as his\r\nattention was called to him by outside influence, Cook was withdrawn from\r\nhis knowledge, and when they again came in contact had already made his\r\nmark. Had they been on the very friendly terms that Kippis suggests, it\r\nis unlikely that he would have made so many incorrect statements as to\r\nCook's early career in the Navy. On 23rd April Cook received his orders, and was told at the same time\r\nthat as he had expressed a doubt about being able to get suitable men in\r\nPortsmouth, he would be provided with conduct money and free carriage of\r\nchests and bedding for those he could raise in London, and they should be\r\ntransferred to Portsmouth in the Trent. Mr. William Parker was appointed\r\nMaster's mate, and the whole crew left Portsmouth on 7th May in H.M.S. Lark, arriving in St. John's on the 14th June.

After getting the guns and stores on board, and fitting the ship for her\r\nnew duties, they left St. John's on 4th July for the north. A base line\r\nwas laid out at Noddy's Harbour, and the latitude of Cape Norman was\r\nfound to be 51 degrees 39 minutes North; soundings were taken every mile. On 3rd August Cook left the ship in the cutter to continue his work, but\r\nhaving met with a nasty accident he had to return on the 6th. It seems he\r\nhad a large powder horn in his hand, when, by some means not stated, the\r\npowder ignited, and the horn \"was blown up and burst in his hand, which\r\nshattered it in a terrible manner, and one of the people which was hard\r\nby suffered greatly by the same accident.\" The Grenville left at once for\r\nNoddy's Harbour, where there was a French ship which had a doctor on\r\nboard, arriving there at eleven o'clock, was able to secure some sort of\r\nmedical assistance, though probably in the eye of a modern medical man,\r\nof a very rough nature. At that time surgery, especially on board ship,\r\nwas very heroic; a glass of spirits the only anodyne, and boiling pitch\r\nthe most reliable styptic. In reference to this accident the Lords of the Admiralty wrote to Lord\r\nHalifax, quoting a letter they had received from Captain Pallisser, dated\r\n14th November 1764:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cook, the surveyor, has returned.

They returned to\r\nEngland for the winter, and crossing the Banks, a series of soundings\r\nwere made and the nature of the bottom carefully noted. When Cook arrived at Woolwich, he pointed out to their Lordships that the\r\ncompletion of his charts would entail his being absent from his ship, and\r\nhe would be unable to supervise everything that had to be done on board,\r\nhe therefore suggested that she should be sent to Deptford yard. This was\r\nat once agreed to, and Cook was able to devote his whole time to his\r\ncharts. His own work had to be supplemented by the observations made by\r\nsix men-of-war stationed in Newfoundland waters as their commanding\r\nofficers had received special instructions to take ample soundings and\r\ncareful observations, and to make charts which were to be sent to Captain\r\nPallisser, who was informed that he would be held responsible if these\r\norders were not carried out in their entirety. It is very certain that an\r\norder so emphatically enforced on his notice would not be permitted to\r\nremain a dead letter. GRENVILLE'S RIG CHANGED. Whilst at Deptford, the rig of the Grenville was altered from schooner to\r\nbrig, as Cook thought that her sailing qualities would be improved by the\r\nchange, and she also received a thorough overhaul. In the previous year\r\nher armament had been supplied from the flagship, and of course had to be\r\nreturned, so now she was established with \"6 swivel guns, 12 Musquets,\r\nand powder and shot\" of her own, and her crew was augmented to twenty,\r\nincluding a midshipman and a carpenter's mate, paid as on board a sixth\r\nrate. Isaac Smith, Mrs. Cook's cousin, afterwards Admiral, who lived with\r\nher at Clapham, was the midshipman. On 25th March 1765 the Grenville\r\nagain left for Newfoundland, arriving at St. Lawrence Harbour on 2nd June\r\nto recommence her work.

From the log of the Grenville it appears that the survey was not carried\r\nout continuously, and this may be accounted for by the fact that the\r\nGovernor was being called upon to settle disputes with the French\r\nfishermen, who were only too apt to place the broadest construction on\r\nthe treaty rights accorded to them. It is very possible that Cook, during\r\nthis year, rendered assistance to Captains Debbieg and Bassett,\r\nengineers, who were engaged in surveying important points and harbours\r\nwith a view to fortification, and Pallisser had been instructed to give\r\nthem every help. There is no positive record that Cook did assist, but\r\nhis ship was several times engaged near where they were at work, and it\r\nseems very reasonable to suppose that he worked with them, especially as\r\nsuch work might be very important to both parties. Cook returned to Spithead on 30th November, and from thence to Deptford\r\nfor the winter, and in February obtained permission from the Admiralty to\r\npublish the charts he had completed; Captain Pallisser, who made the\r\napplication, said he was of opinion that they \"would be of great\r\nencouragement to new adventurers on the fisheries upon those coasts.\"\r\n\r\nECLIPSE OF THE SUN. He again left Deptford on 20th April 1766, and arrived at Bon Bon Bay,\r\n1st June, to survey the south-west and south coasts. At the Burgeo\r\nIslands, near Cape Ray, which were reached on 24th July, Cook was able to\r\ntake an observation of an eclipse of the sun occurring on 5th August. On\r\nhis return to England at the end of the year, he handed the results of\r\nhis observations to Dr. Bevis, a prominent Fellow of the Royal Society,\r\nwho communicated them to that body on 30th April 1767, and the account is\r\nto be found in the Philosophical Transactions of that year. Dr. Bevis\r\ndescribes Cook as \"a good mathematician, and very expert at his\r\nbusiness,\" and says he was supplied with very good instruments; that\r\nthere were three observers \"with good telescopes, who all agreed as to\r\nthe moment of beginning and ending\"; that he had shown Cook's results to\r\nMr. George Mitchell, who had calculated therefrom the difference of\r\nlongitude between the Burgeo Islands and Oxford, where another good\r\nobservation had been taken. Cook makes no reference to the eclipse in the log of the Grenville, but\r\nit appears that he was peculiarly lucky in the weather, for the five days\r\npreceding are described as \"foggy,\" and the four or five succeeding are\r\n\"raining with squalls.\" This observation was a most fortunate one for\r\nCook, as it brought him to the favourable notice of the Royal Society, a\r\nbody of eminent men, outside his own profession, which was able, soon\r\nafter, to advance his interests, and in course of time to admit him into\r\nits own ranks as an ornament of which it is still proud. On 4th November the Grenville left St. John's for winter quarters at\r\nDeptford, and the log ends on 24th November, \"Dungeness light North-East\r\nby East 2 miles.\" Mr. Parker, his assistant, was promoted to a\r\nlieutenancy, and Mr. Michael Lane, who was mentioned for the post by\r\nCaptain Graves in 1763, and who was now schoolmaster on the Guernsey, was\r\nappointed in his place. On 5th April 1767 the Grenville had completed her refit, warped out of\r\ndock, and was at anchor waiting for the tide to turn in order to drop\r\ndown to Woolwich, when the Three Sisters, a Sunderland collier, Thomas\r\nBoyd, Master, \"fell athwart her hawse and carried away her bowsprit, cap,\r\nand jibboom,\" which had to be replaced.

From Cook's character the story may well be true,\r\nexcepting it has been applied to the wrong ship. When the repairs were executed the Grenville sailed for Newfoundland,\r\narriving off Cape Race on 9th May, and Cook at once set to work on the\r\nsurvey of the west coast. He landed in September at the mouth of the\r\nHumber, and made a rapid examination of that river, discovering several\r\nlakes, and getting a good general idea of that part of the island. He\r\nreturned to St. John's for the last time on 14th October, having\r\npractically completed the survey of the general run of the coast, and\r\nadded very considerably to the knowledge of some of the interior parts of\r\nthe island. In 1762 a map was published, compiled from the very latest\r\ninformation, and on it is the note: \"The inland parts of this island are\r\nentirely unknown.\" Cook is said to have discovered valuable seams of\r\ncoal, but there is no note of anything of the kind amongst his records. THE GRENVILLE ASHORE. He sailed for England on 23rd October, and anchored off the Nore in very\r\nheavy weather on 11th November. It was soon found that the anchors would\r\nnot hold, and at length one parted and the ship \"trailed into shallow\r\nwater, striking hard.\" After a while she again struck heavily, and \"lay\r\ndown on her larboard bilge.\" As there seemed no prospect of the gale\r\nmoderating, everything was made as snug as time would allow, and, putting\r\nhis crew into the boats, Cook made for Sheerness. The weather at length\r\nimproved, so obtaining assistance he returned and found that fortunately\r\nhis ship had sustained very little damage, and the next day he\r\nsuccessfully floated her, and got her up to Deptford yards on the\r\nfollowing Sunday, and then Cook was able to set to work on his charts. On\r\n3rd February, Pallisser wrote to Mr. Stephens asking him to obtain\r\npermission from the Lords to publish, and at once obtained the necessary\r\nauthority. Some of these charts had been published in 1766, and now the complete\r\nseries appeared with sailing directions for the south and east coasts of\r\nthe islands. Admiral Sir W.J.L. Wharton, the late hydrographer to the\r\nAdmiralty, says:\r\n\r\n\"The Charts he made during these years in the schooner Grenville were\r\nadmirable. The best proof of their excellence is that they are not yet\r\nwholly superseded by the more detailed surveys of modern times. Like all\r\nfirst surveys of a practically unknown shore, and especially when that\r\nshore abounds in rocks and shoals, and is much indented with bays and\r\ncreeks, they are imperfect in the sense of having many omissions; but\r\nwhen the amount of the ground covered, and the impediments of fogs and\r\nbad weather on that coast is considered, and that Cook had at the most\r\nonly one assistant, their accuracy is truly astonishing.\"\r\n\r\nOn the publication of his charts, Cook's connection with Newfoundland was\r\nconcluded, and on 12th April 1768 Mr. Lane was \"appointed to act as\r\nMaster of the brig Grenville, and surveyor of the coasts of Newfoundland\r\nand Labrador in the absence of Mr. Cook, who is to be employed\r\nelsewhere.\" Mr. Lane was to be paid an allowance of five shillings per\r\nday over and above his pay as Master of a sixth rate. Cook and he were\r\npaid their allowances up to 31st December 1767, and on 17th June the Navy\r\nBoard were ordered to complete Cook's allowance up to 12th April. From\r\nthe wording of Mr. Lane's appointment it would appear that the surveyor's\r\nposition was to be left open for Cook if it was thought desirable for him\r\nto resume it. CHAPTER 6. 1768.

This committee advised\r\nthat two observers should be sent to Hudson's Bay, two to the South\r\nPacific and, if Sweden did not send there, two to the North Cape.

He was\r\nafterwards for a time hydrographer to the East India Company, and was\r\nthen appointed the first hydrographer to the Admiralty. He was dismissed\r\nfrom this position for exceeding his powers, and soon afterwards died. He\r\nappears to have been a clever man, but of an extremely overbearing\r\ndisposition and a very high opinion of himself. In writing to Dr. Hawkesworth on one occasion, he said: \"I never write on any subject I do\r\nnot thoroughly understand.\" What makes the remark more interesting is\r\nthat he was quite in the wrong on the subject under discussion. He\r\nappears never to have forgiven Cook for having been successful in\r\nobtaining the command of the expedition to observe the Transit of Venus,\r\nand for completely upsetting his pet theory of a large continent in the\r\nSouthern Ocean. PURCHASE OF THE ENDEAVOUR. The Navy Board, having been ordered by the Admiralty to propose a proper\r\nvessel to convey the observers to the South Seas, first suggested the\r\nTryal Sloop, and then the Rose, but both being found unsuitable they were\r\nordered to purchase one. On 29th March the Board wrote to Stephens that\r\nthey had bought:\r\n\r\n\"a cat-built Bark, in Burthen 368 Tuns and of the age of three years and\r\nnine months, for conveying such persons as shall be thought proper to the\r\nSouthward...\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, instructions were sought as to fitting and arming her\r\nfor the service, and as to the name under with she was to be registered\r\non the list of the Navy. A cat-built ship is described in the\r\nEncyclopaedias as one with round bluff bows, a wide deep waist, and\r\ntapering towards the stern. The name is derived from the Norwegian kati,\r\na ship. The cat-built bark, the now immortal Endeavour, was built by Messrs. Fishburn of Whitby, and owned by Mr. William Milner of that port.

To be called The Endeavour Bark.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Records of the Survey Office, List of H.M. Navy, 1771 to 1776,\r\nit has been ascertained that her price was 2,800 pounds, and the cost of\r\nfitting her for the voyage was 2,294 pounds. The reason she was named\r\nofficially either the Bark Endeavour or Endeavour Bark, was that there\r\nwas another Endeavour in the Navy, stationed at that time at the Nore. Kippis says that Pallisser was entrusted with the selection of the ship,\r\nand that he called on Cook for assistance in the matter, and the fact\r\nthat a Whitby-built ship was chosen, of a kind in which Cook had had\r\nconsiderable experience, adds to the probability of his statement. Dalrymple enters a claim, in letters to Dr. Hawkesworth, to having chosen\r\nthe Endeavour for the voyage, but as she was not ordered to be surveyed,\r\nwith a view to purchase, till 23rd March, when it was well-known the\r\nAdmiralty had refused to allow him the command of the expedition, there\r\nis little force in his claim. COPPER SHEATHING. Admiral Wharton assumes that as Cook expresses himself averse from having\r\nexploring ships sheathed in copper, owing to the difficulty of making\r\nrepairs in case of accident far from proper facilities, and from the\r\nfrequent mention of \"heeling and boot-topping\" in the Journal of the\r\nEndeavour, it is most probable that she was sheathed in wood. This\r\nassumption is correct, for there is no mention of copper sheathing in the\r\nSurveyor's books, nor at the time of her being repaired at the Endeavour\r\nRiver, nor at Batavia, when it is impossible that any account of her\r\ndamaged bottom could be given without the mention of copper if any such\r\nsheathing had been used. The Naval Chronicle says the first ship of the\r\nRoyal Navy to be sheathed with copper was the Alarm frigate in 1758; and\r\nit is also said that the Dolphin, the ship in which Captain Wallis sailed\r\nround the world, was the only coppered ship in the service at this time,\r\nand she remained the only one for some years. On 5th May, at a Council Meeting of the Royal Society, Captain John\r\nCampbell, R.N., proposed that Cook, who was in attendance, and had been\r\nappointed by the Admiralty to the command of the Endeavour, was a fit and\r\nproper person to be one of the observers for the Society in the Southern\r\nSeas. Cook was called in, and accepted the position in consideration of\r\nsuch a gratuity as the Society should think proper, and an allowance of\r\n120 pounds per year \"for victualling himself and another observer in\r\nevery particular.\" Mr. Green was also called in, and accepted the place\r\nas the other observer for the gratuity of 200 guineas for the two years\r\nthe voyage was expected to take, and at the rate of 100 guineas a year\r\nafterwards. A list of the instruments to be supplied by the Society was\r\nalso prepared at the same meeting, and the workmen engaged on them were\r\nordered to show them to Messrs. Green and Cook, and give any desired\r\ninformation. A portable observatory, said to have been designed by\r\nSmeaton, the builder of the Eddystone Lighthouse, framed of wood and\r\ncovered with canvas, was also prepared. Mr. Maskelyne, knowing the value\r\nof a good watch when observing for longitude, lent the Society one of his\r\nown, made by Graham, to be entrusted to Mr.", "sentences": ["Young says that her original name was the Earl of Pembroke, but Sir Evan\r\nMacgregor wrote to Mr.", "Waddington in 1888 that she was purchased \"under\r\nthe name of the Endeavour, and was entered as a barque.\" The Warrant\r\nEntry Book from Board of Trade proves that Dr.", "Young was right, as the\r\nfollowing entries will show:\r\n\r\n\"Deptford, March 23rd 1768.", "Two cats called the Valentine and the Earl of\r\nPembroke to be surveyed and report which is the properest to be\r\npurchased.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deptford, March 28th 1768.", "Ship Earl of Pembroke to be received.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deptford, April 7th 1768.", "Ship purchased to be sheathed, filled, and\r\nfitted for a voyage to the southward.", "To be called The Endeavour Bark.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Records of the Survey Office, List of H.M.", "Navy, 1771 to 1776,\r\nit has been ascertained that her price was 2,800 pounds, and the cost of\r\nfitting her for the voyage was 2,294 pounds.", "The reason she was named\r\nofficially either the Bark Endeavour or Endeavour Bark, was that there\r\nwas another Endeavour in the Navy, stationed at that time at the Nore.", "Kippis says that Pallisser was entrusted with the selection of the ship,\r\nand that he called on Cook for assistance in the matter, and the fact\r\nthat a Whitby-built ship was chosen, of a kind in which Cook had had\r\nconsiderable experience, adds to the probability of his statement.", "Dalrymple enters a claim, in letters to Dr.", "Hawkesworth, to having chosen\r\nthe Endeavour for the voyage, but as she was not ordered to be surveyed,\r\nwith a view to purchase, till 23rd March, when it was well-known the\r\nAdmiralty had refused to allow him the command of the expedition, there\r\nis little force in his claim.", "COPPER SHEATHING.", "Admiral Wharton assumes that as Cook expresses himself averse from having\r\nexploring ships sheathed in copper, owing to the difficulty of making\r\nrepairs in case of accident far from proper facilities, and from the\r\nfrequent mention of \"heeling and boot-topping\" in the Journal of the\r\nEndeavour, it is most probable that she was sheathed in wood.", "This\r\nassumption is correct, for there is no mention of copper sheathing in the\r\nSurveyor's books, nor at the time of her being repaired at the Endeavour\r\nRiver, nor at Batavia, when it is impossible that any account of her\r\ndamaged bottom could be given without the mention of copper if any such\r\nsheathing had been used.", "The Naval Chronicle says the first ship of the\r\nRoyal Navy to be sheathed with copper was the Alarm frigate in 1758; and\r\nit is also said that the Dolphin, the ship in which Captain Wallis sailed\r\nround the world, was the only coppered ship in the service at this time,\r\nand she remained the only one for some years.", "On 5th May, at a Council Meeting of the Royal Society, Captain John\r\nCampbell, R.N., proposed that Cook, who was in attendance, and had been\r\nappointed by the Admiralty to the command of the Endeavour, was a fit and\r\nproper person to be one of the observers for the Society in the Southern\r\nSeas.", "Cook was called in, and accepted the position in consideration of\r\nsuch a gratuity as the Society should think proper, and an allowance of\r\n120 pounds per year \"for victualling himself and another observer in\r\nevery particular.\" Mr.", "Green was also called in, and accepted the place\r\nas the other observer for the gratuity of 200 guineas for the two years\r\nthe voyage was expected to take, and at the rate of 100 guineas a year\r\nafterwards.", "A list of the instruments to be supplied by the Society was\r\nalso prepared at the same meeting, and the workmen engaged on them were\r\nordered to show them to Messrs.", "Green and Cook, and give any desired\r\ninformation.", "A portable observatory, said to have been designed by\r\nSmeaton, the builder of the Eddystone Lighthouse, framed of wood and\r\ncovered with canvas, was also prepared.", "Mr.", "Maskelyne, knowing the value\r\nof a good watch when observing for longitude, lent the Society one of his\r\nown, made by Graham, to be entrusted to Mr."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_32", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 32)", "language": "it", "content": "Green, and it was signed for\r\nwith the other instruments supplied.

In the Commissions and Warrants Book, under date 26th May 1768, appears\r\nthe following entry:\r\n\r\nMR. JAMES COOK (2nd) 1st Lieutenant Endeavour Bark. E.H., C.T., C.S. The initials signify Edward Hawke, Charles Townshend, and Lord Charles\r\nSpencer. The \"(2nd)\" evidently refers to the fact that there was already\r\none James Cook, a lieutenant in the Navy, namely, the former Master of\r\nthe Mercury, and Third Lieutenant of the Gosport. PENDANT HOISTED. Having received his orders Cook proceeded to Deptford and hoisted his\r\npendant on H.M.S. Endeavour on 27th May, and at once started to prepare\r\nfor sea. A considerable quantity of coal was taken on board to use for\r\ndrying the ship, as it occupied so much less room than wood. Captain Wallis returned from his voyage round the world about this time,\r\nand in consequence of his report, the Island of Georgeland, afterwards\r\ncalled by Cook Otaheite and now Tahiti, was fixed upon by the Royal\r\nSociety as the most desirable place for the observations, and the\r\nAdmiralty were requested to issue the proper orders, notifying at the\r\nsame time that Mr. Charles Green and Lieutenant James Cook had been\r\nappointed observers. They also in the same letter write that:\r\n\r\n\"Joseph Banks, Esquire, Fellow of this Society, a Gentleman of large\r\nfortune, who is well versed in Natural History, being desirous of\r\nundertaking the same voyage, the council very earnestly request their\r\nLordships that in regard to Mr. Banks' great personal merit and for the\r\nadvancement of useful knowledge, he also, together with his suite, being\r\nseven persons more (that is eight persons in all) together with their\r\nbaggage, be received on board of the ship under command of Captain Cook.\"\r\n\r\nThey also requested that the expedition might be landed a month or six\r\nweeks before the 3rd June in order that the instruments might be got into\r\nproper working order, and for fear the ship might not be able to reach\r\nGeorgeland, a table of the limits within which the observations might be\r\ntaken, was enclosed. Full instructions were also given to the two\r\nobservers, and a list of the fixed stars to be observed was drawn up by\r\nMr. Maskelyne. The order to receive Mr. Green and Mr. Banks and party was issued on 22nd\r\nJuly, \"for victuals only\"--i.e., they were to be supplied with the same\r\nas the rest of the ship's company whilst on board. The members of Banks's\r\nparty were: Dr. Solander, naturalist; H. Sporing, assistant naturalist;\r\nA. Buchan, S. Parkinson, and Jno. Reynolds, artists; James Roberts and\r\nPeter Briscoe, white servants; Thomas Richmond and J. Dorlton, coloured\r\nservants. It was owing to the personal friendship between them that Banks was\r\npermitted by Lord Sandwich, the First Lord of the Admiralty, to accompany\r\nCook. He had taken up the study of Botany when at Eton, and at an early\r\nage had been elected F.R.S. He seems quickly to have formed a just\r\nestimate of Cook's worth; indeed, Sir John Barrow says he took a liking\r\nto him at the first interview, and a firm friendship sprang up between\r\nthem which endured to the end. Many instances are to be found of his\r\ninterest in and his support to Cook after their return home; and this\r\nfriendship speaks volumes for Cook, for, though Banks was a most kindly\r\nnatured man, he had at times a very overbearing manner. Sir Joseph Hooker, in his introduction, quotes a most interesting letter\r\nfrom Mr.", "sentences": ["Green, and it was signed for\r\nwith the other instruments supplied.", "Chronometers, of course, at that\r\ntime were in process of evolution, several makers were endeavouring to\r\ngain the prize which had been offered for a reliable timekeeper.", "Shortly\r\nafter, at a second meeting, Cook agreed to accept a gratuity from the\r\nSociety of 100 guineas for taking the observations, and was paid 120\r\npounds sustenance money for Mr.", "Green and himself, with authority to draw\r\non the Society during the voyage for a further amount not exceeding 120\r\npounds.", "In the Commissions and Warrants Book, under date 26th May 1768, appears\r\nthe following entry:\r\n\r\nMR.", "JAMES COOK (2nd) 1st Lieutenant Endeavour Bark.", "E.H., C.T., C.S.", "The initials signify Edward Hawke, Charles Townshend, and Lord Charles\r\nSpencer.", "The \"(2nd)\" evidently refers to the fact that there was already\r\none James Cook, a lieutenant in the Navy, namely, the former Master of\r\nthe Mercury, and Third Lieutenant of the Gosport.", "PENDANT HOISTED.", "Having received his orders Cook proceeded to Deptford and hoisted his\r\npendant on H.M.S.", "Endeavour on 27th May, and at once started to prepare\r\nfor sea.", "A considerable quantity of coal was taken on board to use for\r\ndrying the ship, as it occupied so much less room than wood.", "Captain Wallis returned from his voyage round the world about this time,\r\nand in consequence of his report, the Island of Georgeland, afterwards\r\ncalled by Cook Otaheite and now Tahiti, was fixed upon by the Royal\r\nSociety as the most desirable place for the observations, and the\r\nAdmiralty were requested to issue the proper orders, notifying at the\r\nsame time that Mr.", "Charles Green and Lieutenant James Cook had been\r\nappointed observers.", "They also in the same letter write that:\r\n\r\n\"Joseph Banks, Esquire, Fellow of this Society, a Gentleman of large\r\nfortune, who is well versed in Natural History, being desirous of\r\nundertaking the same voyage, the council very earnestly request their\r\nLordships that in regard to Mr.", "Banks' great personal merit and for the\r\nadvancement of useful knowledge, he also, together with his suite, being\r\nseven persons more (that is eight persons in all) together with their\r\nbaggage, be received on board of the ship under command of Captain Cook.\"\r\n\r\nThey also requested that the expedition might be landed a month or six\r\nweeks before the 3rd June in order that the instruments might be got into\r\nproper working order, and for fear the ship might not be able to reach\r\nGeorgeland, a table of the limits within which the observations might be\r\ntaken, was enclosed.", "Full instructions were also given to the two\r\nobservers, and a list of the fixed stars to be observed was drawn up by\r\nMr.", "Maskelyne.", "The order to receive Mr.", "Green and Mr.", "Banks and party was issued on 22nd\r\nJuly, \"for victuals only\"--i.e., they were to be supplied with the same\r\nas the rest of the ship's company whilst on board.", "The members of Banks's\r\nparty were: Dr.", "Solander, naturalist;

After waiting for some days for a fair wind, Cook eventually sailed at 2\r\nP.M. on 26th August, having, as he says in his Journal, \"94 persons,\r\nincluding officers, seamen, Gentlemen and their servants; near 18 months'\r\nprovisions, 10 carriage guns, 12 swivels, with good store of ammunition,\r\nand stores of all kinds\" on board.

Whilst shifting her berth to a more convenient spot, the Endeavour was\r\nfired on by one of the forts owing to some misunderstanding, but\r\nsatisfactory apologies and explanations were made, and it was thought so\r\nlittle of that neither Cook nor Banks mention it in their Journals. This\r\nincident is probably the origin of the story told by Forster in his\r\nJournal of the Second Voyage. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Captain Cook in the Endeavour battered the Loo Fort at Madeira in\r\nconjunction with an English Frigate, thus resenting an affront which had\r\nbeen offered to the British flag.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Endeavour arrived at Funchal, the only British man-of-war there\r\nwas H.M.S.

No other British man-of-war\r\ncame into the port whilst the Endeavour was there, and afterwards, at\r\nRio, Cook expressly informed the Viceroy that he had been well received\r\nby the Portuguese at Madeira. Fresh water, meat, vegetables, and wine were taken on board; wine, fruit,\r\nand water being good and cheap, but the meat and poultry, obtained as a\r\nfavour, were dear. Two men, a marine and a sailor, received twelve lashes\r\nfor refusing to eat their allowance of fresh meat. This appears to be\r\nharsh treatment, but it must be remembered that the lash was at that time\r\nalmost the only recognised method of punishment in the Navy, however\r\ntrivial the offence might be; and Cook knew from experience how important\r\nit was to prevent the scurvy from getting foothold on board, and he\r\nalready had determined to fight, by every means in his power, this dread\r\nscourge, almost his most dangerous foe. He did conquer it even on this\r\nfirst voyage, and, considering his means, in a most marvellous manner. He\r\nwould have claimed the victory had it not been for an untoward event,\r\nwhich will be told hereafter, leading him to postpone his claim till he\r\ncould give further proof. It is important to notice how on every possible\r\noccasion he obtained, wherever he could, some change of diet and fresh\r\nwater. EDEN BEFORE THE FALL. Whilst they were at Funchal, Banks spent five days with the English\r\nConsul, and he describes the place as very pretty, but the people as\r\nprimitive, idle, and uninformed; all their instruments of the rudest\r\nmake; and he thought that the appliances used in the manufacture of wine\r\nmust have been similar to those used by Noah, \"although it is not\r\nimpossible that he might have used better if he remembered the methods he\r\nhad seen before the flood.\" One of the Governors left it on record that,\r\nso averse from change were the people, he thought it most fortunate the\r\nisland was not Eden before the fall, as in that case the inhabitants\r\ncould never have been induced to wear clothes. He explored as much of the\r\nisland as he could, but says he could never get more than three miles\r\naway from the town as his time was so much broken up.

On 19th September, at midnight, they weighed, sighted Teneriffe on the\r\n23rd, and the day following their first flying fish found its way into\r\nMr. Green's cabin. On the 28th they tried steaks for dinner cut from a\r\nyoung shark, which Banks and Solander reported as very good, but the crew\r\nrefused to taste them. Cape de Verde was seen on the 30th, and about a\r\nfortnight afterwards the line was crossed in 29 degrees 24 minutes West\r\nlongitude, and the following day the event was celebrated.

Any one who wished could\r\npurchase immunity for four days' allowance of wine, but the others had to\r\npay the penalty of ducking. Banks compounded for himself and party, and\r\nCook also seems to have got off, but the others were hauled up to the end\r\nof the main-yard on a boatswain's chair, and then at the sound of the\r\nwhistle dropped into the sea, an operation repeated three times.

RECEPTION AT RIO. They struck soundings on 6th November, and on heaving the lead again\r\nfound a difference of less than a foot in three or four hours. Land was\r\nsighted near Cape Frio, Brazil, in latitude 21 degrees 16 minutes South,\r\non the 8th, and they came across a boat manned by eleven blacks who were\r\nengaged in catching and salting fish. Banks purchased some fish, and was\r\nsurprised to find they preferred to be paid in English rather than\r\nSpanish coin. On the 13th they arrived off Rio de Janeiro, where they\r\nwere very ungraciously received by the Viceroy. They were not permitted\r\nto land except under a guard; some of the men who had been sent ashore on\r\nduty were imprisoned. Mr. Hicks, who had gone to report their arrival and\r\nask for the services of a pilot, was detained for a time, and it was only\r\nwith difficulty, and at an exorbitant rate, that they obtained fresh food\r\nand water. Consequently little was seen of the place, except from the\r\nship, and Cook took all possible observations from thence, and made a\r\nsketch map of the harbour, to which he added all the information he was\r\nable to pick up from the pilot. Writing to the Royal Society, he says he\r\nis quite unable to understand the true reason of his treatment, and\r\ncontrasts it with that received by a Spanish ship which came in whilst he\r\nwas there. This Spanish ship willingly undertook to carry to Europe and\r\nforward to the Admiralty copies of the correspondence that passed between\r\nCook and the Viceroy, which Cook describes as\r\n\r\n\"a paper war between me and His Excellency, wherein I had no other\r\nadvantage than the racking his invention to find reasons for treating us\r\nin the manner he did, for he never would relax the least from any one\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\nTo every remonstrance the Viceroy pleaded his instructions and the custom\r\nof the port.", "sentences": ["There was an electrical machine on\r\nboard, and His Excellency was most curious on the subject;

His own words.\" The crew were\r\naccused of smuggling, and it was repeatedly asserted that the Endeavour\r\nwas not a king's ship. Parkinson, one of Mr. Banks's staff, says that\r\nfrequently some of them let themselves down from the cabin window at\r\nmidnight into a boat, and driving with the tide till they were out of\r\nhearing of the guard boat established over them, rowed ashore and made\r\nshort excursions into the country, \"though not so far as we could have\r\nwished to have done.\"\r\n\r\nBanks, speaking of the supplies obtained at Rio, says the beef was cheap\r\nbut very lean and dry; the bread tasted as if made with sawdust, and\r\njustified its name of Farinha de Pao (wooden meal); the fruits, excepting\r\nthe oranges, were very indifferent, and he takes particular exception to\r\nthe banana, which he had not tasted before, it was not at all to his\r\nliking. The water also was very bad, and the crew preferred what they had\r\nbrought with them, though it was very stale. M. de Bougainville reports that when he visited Rio he was at first\r\nreceived in a very friendly manner by this same Viceroy, but after a time\r\nthe treatment was altered, and he had to put up with even greater\r\ninsolence than Cook. THE SECOND DEATH. When the stores had been received on board, the anchor was weighed in\r\norder to take up a more favourable position for making a start, but,\r\nunfortunately, shortly after the ship got underway, a man named Peter\r\nFlowers fell from the main-shrouds into the sea and was drowned before\r\nassistance could be rendered: the second death since leaving England. The\r\nnext day the wind was contrary, but every one was so anxious to turn\r\ntheir backs on the place that Cook ordered out the boats to tow, but they\r\nwere immediately brought up by a shot from the fort of Santa Cruz. A\r\nremonstrance was sent ashore, and received the lame excuse that the\r\npermit for leaving had been signed but had been delayed on its way, and\r\nthe officer in command could not allow the vessel to leave till it was\r\nreceived. Another attempt to get away was soon after made, but the anchor\r\nfouled a rock, and there was again delay; at length, on the 7th December,\r\nthey were able to make a start, discharge their pilot, and bid farewell\r\nto the guard boat which had so constantly kept watch over them. They were\r\ninformed that an Englishman, named Foster, an officer in the Portuguese\r\nservice, who had been of great use to them, was imprisoned for his kind\r\nattentions. On 9th December they met with bad weather and lost their foretop-gallant\r\nmast, but the rough handling they got was credited with improving the\r\nsailing qualities of the ship, as it took some of the stiffness out of\r\nher upperworks. A meteor was noted on the 23rd, like a small bright\r\ncloud, emitting flames, travelling rapidly westward, and disappearing\r\nslowly with two sharp explosions. The same day an eclipse of the sun was\r\nobserved. Christmas Day, for which the men had been saving up their allowances of\r\ngrog, passed in the usual manner, that is, in considerable\r\nover-indulgence.

The continuous and careful\r\nobservations of the state of the sea, and the absence of currents during\r\nthe following month, caused Cook to come to the conclusion that the vast\r\nsouthern continent so long supposed to exist somewhere in that part of\r\nthe globe, and by some people esteemed necessary to preserve its balance,\r\nwas non-existent.

Towards the end of March a change was noticed in the kinds of birds\r\nflying round the ship, some being recognised as ones that were known to\r\nstay near land, and consequently a sharp look-out was kept.

This was the fifth death since leaving England, and none by\r\ndisease.

Some twenty-four persons were counted\r\nthrough the glasses, and were described as copper-coloured, with black\r\nhair; they followed the ship as if prepared to oppose a landing.

On 10th April Osnaburg Island was passed, and next day King George Land\r\nwas sighted; but the wind failed, and they did not get close in till the\r\n12th, when canoes came out to the ship, bringing branches of trees which\r\nwere handed up the side, with signs directing they should be placed\r\nconspicuously in the rigging, as a token of friendship offered and\r\naccepted. When this had been done the natives produced a good supply of\r\ntrade in the shape of vegetables and fruit; amongst the last Banks\r\nenumerates bread-fruit, bananas, coconuts, and apples (a species of hog\r\nplum). These were very acceptable and beneficial to the crew after such a\r\nlapse of time without vegetable food except the wild plants gathered in\r\nTierra del Fuego. AT TAHITI. At 7 A.M. on the 13th they anchored in the bay described by Wallis, known\r\nas Matavai, in thirteen fathoms, and Cook says of his route from Cape\r\nHorn, \"I Endeavoured to make a direct course, and in part succeeded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. 1769. SOCIETY ISLANDS. PRODIGIOUS EXPERT THIEVES. Hardly had the anchor reached the bottom, before they were surrounded by\r\ncanoes, whose occupants were anxious to sell the supplies of fruits, raw\r\nand cooked fish, and a pig they had brought. The price asked for the pig\r\nwas a hatchet, and as these were scarce, it was not purchased. When all\r\nwas made safe, a party went ashore and was well received by the natives,\r\nbut those who had previously been there with Wallis reported that those\r\nwho were at that time said to be chiefs, were keeping in the background. The next day, however, two men, evidently of rank, came on board, and\r\nbeing invited into the cabin, went through a ceremony described by Banks:\r\n\"Each singled out his friend; one took the captain, and the other chose\r\nmyself. Each took off a part of his clothes and dressed his friend with\r\nwhat he took off; in return for this we presented them with a hatchet and\r\nsome beads.\" They were then invited by their new friends to go ashore. On\r\nlanding they were escorted to a building and introduced to an old man\r\nthey had not seen before, and he presented Cook with a cock, and Banks\r\nwith a hen, and each with a piece of native cloth. Banks gave in return\r\nfor his share his large laced silk neckcloth and a linen handkerchief. After this they were permitted to stroll about, and received many tokens\r\nof amity in the shape of green boughs, and were then entertained at a\r\nbanquet, the principal dishes being fish and bread-fruit. Whilst at\r\ndinner, Solander had his pocket picked of an opera glass, and Monkhouse\r\nlost his snuff-box. As soon as this was made known, Lycurgus, as they had\r\nnamed one of their friends, drove off the people, striking them and\r\nthrowing anything he could lay his hand to, at them. He offered pieces of\r\ncloth as compensation, and when these were refused, extended his offer to\r\neverything he possessed. He was, at last, made to understand that all\r\nthat was wanted was the return of the stolen articles, and after a time\r\nthe snuff-box and the case of the glass were returned, and, by and by,\r\nthe glass itself.

On their road back to camp they were alarmed by a musket\r\nshot, and hurrying on, found that one of the sentries had been pushed\r\ndown and his musket stolen, so the midshipman in command had ordered a\r\nshot to be fired at the thief, who was killed, but the musket was not\r\nrecovered. All the natives ran away but one, whom Cook calls Awhaa, and\r\nwhom the Master, Mr. Molineaux, who had been out with Wallis, recognised\r\nas being a man of some authority. Through Awhaa an attempt was made to\r\narrange matters, but the natives were very shy when the English landed\r\nthe next day.

To lessen the chances of disagreements in trading and to\r\nkeep some control of prices, Cook ordered that only one person should\r\nconduct the purchasing for the ship, and as Banks had shown aptitude in\r\ndealing with the natives, he was appointed.

COOK SKETCHES. The camp was now got into order; the north and south sides were protected\r\nby a bank 4 feet 6 inches high on the inside, having a ditch 10 feet wide\r\nand 6 feet deep on the outside. The west side, facing the bay, had a 4\r\nfoot bank crowned by a palisade, with no ditch; and the east side, on the\r\nbank of the river, was protected by a double row of water casks. The\r\narmament consisted of two carriage guns on the weakest or east side, and\r\nsix swivel guns, two on each of the other sides. The garrison was\r\nforty-five men, including civilians, and Cook considered it was\r\npractically impregnable. In the manuscripts department of the British\r\nMuseum is a pen and ink sketch and plan of the fort, drawn by Cook, which\r\nagrees much better with the description than the engraving of Parkinson's\r\ndrawing published in the History of the Voyage. The natives were\r\ndisturbed by these preparations, some even leaving the bay, but when no\r\ndreadful results occurred, they took courage and returned. The fort completed, the instruments were landed and put into the required\r\npositions to be prepared for their work, and the following morning the\r\nquadrant, which had not been removed from the case in which it was packed\r\nin London, was found to be missing, although a sentry had been stationed\r\nwithin five yards of it the whole night. Enquiries were made, and it was\r\nelicited that the thief had been seen making off with it. Banks, his\r\nnative friend, and one or two of the English at once started, closely\r\nfollowed by Cook and a party of marines. After a long chase the quadrant\r\nwas recovered, but some of the smaller parts were missing.

The important day of the observation was now approaching, and everything\r\nwas in readiness. In order to diminish the risk of disappointment through\r\nlocal atmospheric disturbance, Cook sent a party to Eimeo (York Island),\r\nand a second one to the south-east of Otaheite, as far to the east of\r\nPoint Venus as possible. The first party consisted of Lieutenant Gore,\r\nBanks, Sporing, and Monkhouse, and the second of Lieutenant Hicks,\r\nClerke, Pickersgill, and Saunders, Mr. Green providing the necessary\r\ninstruments. At Fort Venus everything was in good working order. The\r\nastronomical clock was set up in the large tent, being placed in a strong\r\nframe made for the purpose at Greenwich, and was then planted in the\r\nground as firmly as possible and fenced round to prevent accidental\r\ndisturbance. Twelve feet away the observatory was placed, comprising the\r\ntelescopes on their stands, the quadrant securely fixed on the top of a\r\ncask of wet sand firmly set in the ground, and the journeyman clock. The\r\ntelescopes used by Cook and Green were two reflecting ones made by Mr. J. Short. \"The 3rd of June proved as favourable to our purposes as we could wish. Not a cloud to be seen the whole day and the air was perfectly clear, so\r\nthat we had every advantage we could desire in observing the whole\r\npassage of the Planet Venus over the Sun's Disk. We very distinctly saw\r\nthe atmosphere or Dusky Shade round the body of the planet, which very\r\nmuch disturbed the time of contact, particularly the two internal ones. Dr. Solander observed as well as Mr. Green and myself, and we differ'd\r\nfrom one another in observing the times of contact much more than could\r\nbe expected. Mr. Green's telescope and mine were of the same magnifying\r\npower, but that of the Doctor was greater than ours. It was nearly calm\r\nthe whole day, and the thermometer exposed to the sun about the middle of\r\nthe day rose to a degree of heat we have not before met with.\"\r\n\r\nIn the report published in the Philosophical Transactions he also refers\r\nto the heat:\r\n\r\n\"Every wished-for favourable circumstance attended the whole of the day,\r\nwithout one single impediment excepting the heat, which was intolerable;\r\nthe thermometer which hung by the clock and was exposed to the sun, as we\r\nwere, was one time as high as 119 degrees.\"\r\n\r\nThis report is accompanied by diagrams illustrating the different\r\ncontacts and the effects of the penumbra, which Cook believed was better\r\nseen by Solander than by himself or Green. It was estimated at about\r\nseven-eighths of the diameter of the planet, and was visible to Cook\r\nthroughout the whole Transit. The times taken by Green were:\r\n\r\nThe first external contact: 9 hours 25 minutes 42 seconds A.M. The first internal contact: 9 hours 44 minutes 4 seconds A.M. The second internal contact: 3 hours 14 minutes 8 seconds P.M. The second external contact: 3 hours 22 minutes 10 seconds P.M. The other two parties were equally successful, and at times Banks was\r\nable to employ himself in trading with the natives, with whom he soon got\r\non friendly terms; in fact, he had to decline further purchases as he had\r\nas much as they could take away with them. He was also successful in his\r\nbotanical enquiries, obtaining several plants he had not seen in\r\nOtaheite.

The sentence was carried out, and though it was well known\r\nthat more than one was implicated, he refused to name any one else, but\r\nsuffered in silence. A DOG DINNER. The King's Birthday being on 5th June, Cook entertained several of the\r\nchiefs at dinner, and the health of Kilnargo was toasted so many times by\r\nsome of them that the result was disastrous. One of the presents received\r\nfrom a chief was a dog, which they were informed was good to eat. After\r\nsome discussion it was handed to a native named Tupia, who had made\r\nhimself very useful, and afterwards accompanied them on the voyage; and\r\nhe having smothered it with his hands, and drawn it, wrapped it in leaves\r\nand baked it in a native oven. With some hesitation it was tasted, and\r\nmet with general approval. Cook says: \"Therefore we resolved for the\r\nfuture never to despise dog flesh\"; and in another place he says they put\r\ndog's flesh \"next only to English lamb.\" These dogs were bred for eating,\r\nand lived entirely on vegetable food. The main object of their stay at Otaheite having been attained, steps\r\nwere taken for further prosecution of the voyage; the ship was careened,\r\nher bottom scraped and found free from worm, but the boats had suffered,\r\nparticularly the long-boat, which had to have a new bottom. She had been\r\nvarnished only; the other boats, painted with white lead, had not\r\nsuffered so much. The stores were overhauled, and the ship was fitted for\r\nsea. Whilst these preparations were being made, Cook and Banks made a\r\ncircuit of the island in the pinnace to examine the coast. Several good\r\nanchorages were found, with from sixteen to twenty-four fathoms and good\r\nholding ground. The south-east portion was almost cut off from the\r\nmainland by a narrow, marshy isthmus about two miles wide, over which the\r\nnatives dragged their canoes with little difficulty. On the south coast\r\none of the large burying-places was seen; by far the most extensive one\r\non the island. It is described as:\r\n\r\n\"a long square of stonework built pyramidically; its base is 267 feet by\r\n87 feet; at the Top it is 250 feet by 8 feet. It is built in the same\r\nmanner as we do steps leading up to a sun-dial or fountain erected in the\r\nmiddle of a square, where there is a flite of steps on each side. In this\r\nbuilding there are 11 of such steps; each step is about 4 feet in height,\r\nand the breadth 4 feet 7 inches, but they decreased both in height and\r\nbreadth from the bottom to the Top. On the middle of the Top stood the\r\nimage of a Bird carved in wood, near it lay the broken one of a Fish,\r\ncarved in stone. There was no hollow or cavity in the inside, the whole\r\nbeing filled up with stones. The outside was faced partly with hewn\r\nstones, and partly with others, and these were placed in such a manner as\r\nto look very agreeable to the eye. Some of the hewn stones were 4 feet 7\r\ninches by 2 feet 4 inches, and 15 inches thick, and had been squared and\r\npolished with some sort of an edge tool. On the east side was, enclosed\r\nwith a stone wall, a piece of ground in form of a square, 360 feet by\r\n354, in this was growing several cypress trees and plantains. Round about\r\nthis Morie were several smaller ones, all going to decay, and on the\r\nBeach, between them and the sea, lay scattered up and down, a great\r\nquantity of human bones. Not far from the Great Morie, was 2 or 3 pretty\r\nlarge altars, where lay the scull bones of some Hogs and Dogs. This\r\nmonument stands on the south side of Opooreanoo, upon a low point of land\r\nabout 100 yards from the sea. It appeared to have been built many years\r\nand was in a state of decay, as most of their Mories are.", "sentences": ["One man was found with seven in his\r\npossession, and after careful enquiry was sentenced to two dozen lashes,\r\nwhich seems to have been the severest sentence meted out by Cook during\r\nthe voyage.", "The sentence was carried out, and though it was well known\r\nthat more than one was implicated, he refused to name any one else, but\r\nsuffered in silence.", "A DOG DINNER.", "The King's Birthday being on 5th June, Cook entertained several of the\r\nchiefs at dinner, and the health of Kilnargo was toasted so many times by\r\nsome of them that the result was disastrous.", "One of the presents received\r\nfrom a chief was a dog, which they were informed was good to eat.", "After\r\nsome discussion it was handed to a native named Tupia, who had made\r\nhimself very useful, and afterwards accompanied them on the voyage; and\r\nhe having smothered it with his hands, and drawn it, wrapped it in leaves\r\nand baked it in a native oven.", "With some hesitation it was tasted, and\r\nmet with general approval.", "Cook says: \"Therefore we resolved for the\r\nfuture never to despise dog flesh\"; and in another place he says they put\r\ndog's flesh \"next only to English lamb.\" These dogs were bred for eating,\r\nand lived entirely on vegetable food.", "The main object of their stay at Otaheite having been attained, steps\r\nwere taken for further prosecution of the voyage; the ship was careened,\r\nher bottom scraped and found free from worm, but the boats had suffered,\r\nparticularly the long-boat, which had to have a new bottom.", "She had been\r\nvarnished only; the other boats, painted with white lead, had not\r\nsuffered so much.", "The stores were overhauled, and the ship was fitted for\r\nsea.", "Whilst these preparations were being made, Cook and Banks made a\r\ncircuit of the island in the pinnace to examine the coast.", "Several good\r\nanchorages were found, with from sixteen to twenty-four fathoms and good\r\nholding ground.", "The south-east portion was almost cut off from the\r\nmainland by a narrow, marshy isthmus about two miles wide, over which the\r\nnatives dragged their canoes with little difficulty.", "On the south coast\r\none of the large burying-places was seen; by far the most extensive one\r\non the island.", "It is described as:\r\n\r\n\"a long square of stonework built pyramidically; its base is 267 feet by\r\n87 feet; at the Top it is 250 feet by 8 feet.", "It is built in the same\r\nmanner as we do steps leading up to a sun-dial or fountain erected in the\r\nmiddle of a square, where there is a flite of steps on each side.", "In this\r\nbuilding there are 11 of such steps; each step is about 4 feet in height,\r\nand the breadth 4 feet 7 inches, but they decreased both in height and\r\nbreadth from the bottom to the Top.", "On the middle of the Top stood the\r\nimage of a Bird carved in wood, near it lay the broken one of a Fish,\r\ncarved in stone.", "There was no hollow or cavity in the inside, the whole\r\nbeing filled up with stones.", "The outside was faced partly with hewn\r\nstones, and partly with others, and these were placed in such a manner as\r\nto look very agreeable to the eye.", "Some of the hewn stones were 4 feet 7\r\ninches by 2 feet 4 inches, and 15 inches thick, and had been squared and\r\npolished with some sort of an edge tool.", "On the east side was, enclosed\r\nwith a stone wall, a piece of ground in form of a square, 360 feet by\r\n354, in this was growing several cypress trees and plantains.", "Round about\r\nthis Morie were several smaller ones, all going to decay, and on the\r\nBeach, between them and the sea, lay scattered up and down, a great\r\nquantity of human bones.", "Not far from the Great Morie, was 2 or 3 pretty\r\nlarge altars, where lay the scull bones of some Hogs and Dogs.", "This\r\nmonument stands on the south side of Opooreanoo, upon a low point of land\r\nabout 100 yards from the sea.", "It appeared to have been built many years\r\nand was in a state of decay, as most of their Mories are."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_44", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 44)", "language": "it", "content": "\"\r\n\r\nThey were quite unable to gain information as to the history of these\r\nremains, nor of the religious belief of the islander, though they\r\nappeared to have some vague notions of a future life. AN EXCURSION INLAND. When the party returned to Point Venus, they found the refitting nearly\r\ncomplete, but the anchor stocks all had to be renewed owing to the\r\nravages of the sea worms, so Banks and Monkhouse made an excursion up the\r\nriver on which the camp was situated. In about nine miles the precipitous\r\nbanks had completely closed them in, and further advance was blocked by a\r\ncliff, at least 100 feet high, over which the river fell. The natives\r\nwith them said they had never been further, so the expedition returned. Charles Darwin, in 1835, made an attempt to ascend the same river, and\r\nthough he penetrated some distance further, he describes the country as\r\nextremely difficult; he saw several places where two or three determined\r\nmen could easily hold at bay many times their own number. Gardens had been laid out during their stay, and European seeds were\r\nplanted which were very fairly successful; except some brought out by\r\nCook in carefully sealed bottles, none of which turned out well. Some of the sailors were either enticed away, or attempted to desert, so\r\nCook seized one or two of the chiefs as hostages, and the runaways were\r\nquickly returned. Some of the natives were anxious to go away with them,\r\nand Banks persuaded Cook to let him take Tupia, a man supposed to be of\r\npriestly rank, who had proved himself very useful on several occasions,\r\nand he was allowed to take with him a boy as servant. Cook records, on\r\nleaving, that during the three months' stay they had been on very good\r\nterms with the natives, and the few misunderstandings that did occur rose\r\neither from the difficulty of explaining matters to each other, or else\r\nfrom the inveterate habits of theft on the part of the natives--iron in\r\nany shape being simply irresistible. On 13th July the Endeavour sailed for Huaheine, anchoring inside the reef\r\non the north-west, on the 17th. Banks, Solander, Monkhouse, and Tupia at\r\nonce accompanied Cook ashore, where a ceremony, presumed to be a sort of\r\ntreaty of peace, was gone through, and then they were permitted to go\r\nwhere they liked. On this ceremonial Cook says:\r\n\r\n\"It further appear'd that the things which Tupia gave away, was for the\r\nGod of this people, as they gave us a hog and some coconuts for our God,\r\nand thus they have certainly drawn us in to commit sacrilege, for the Hog\r\nhath already received sentence of Death and is to be dissected tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nA CAREFUL PILOT. A market was organised by Monkhouse, and as soon as the natives\r\nunderstood that the stay of the ship would be very short, they managed to\r\nproduce a fairly good supply of fruits and vegetables. The people were\r\nfound to be rather lighter complexioned, and certainly not so addicted to\r\nthieving as the Otaheitans. As a memorial of the visit, Cook gave the\r\nchief a plate with the inscription, \"His Britannick Majesty's Ship,\r\nEndeavour, Lieutenant Cook, Commander, 16th July, 1769, Huaheine.\" He\r\nalso added \"some medals, or counters of the English coins, struck in\r\n1761, and other presents,\" and the recipient promised he would never part\r\nwith them. From this place they went on to Ulietea (Raiatea), landing on\r\nthe 21st; and after another ceremonial the English \"Jack\" was hoisted,\r\nand possession taken of the whole group in the name of King George. Tupia\r\nproved himself an excellent pilot, with great knowledge of the\r\nlocalities, and, having sent down a diver at Huaheine to ascertain the\r\nexact draught of the ship, he was very careful she never went into less\r\nthan five fathoms of water.

the language, manners and customs agreed most\r\nexactly.\"\r\n\r\nDetained by adverse wind off Ataha, and finding the water coming badly\r\ninto the fore sail-room and powder-room, Cook put into the west side to\r\nrepair and take in ballast, as the ship was getting too light to carry\r\nsail on a wind. He took the opportunity to survey to the north with Banks\r\nand Solander. Putting into one place, they were well received and\r\nentertained with music and dancing, and Cook's verdict was that \"neither\r\ntheir Musick or Dancing were at all calculated to please a European.\" A\r\nsort of farce was also acted, but they could make nothing of it, except\r\nthat it \"showed that these people have a notion of Dramatic\r\nPerformances.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole stay in the Society Group they had been very well off\r\nfor fresh food, consequently their sea stores had been little called on. Jarvis, in his History of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands, says that\r\nwith Cook \"a silence in regard to the maritime efforts of his\r\npredecessors is observable throughout his Journals\"; and as a proof that\r\nhe traded on the knowledge of others, he remarks that at Otaheite he made\r\nenquiries if there were any islands to the north; and afterwards evinced\r\nno surprise when he discovered them. Now Cook in his Journals constantly\r\nshows that he compares his knowledge with that of others, and often\r\nregrets he has not further records to consult. As for his enquiries, he\r\nwould have been grossly neglecting his duty had he not made them, for it\r\nwas only a commonsense method of procedure, which evidently Mr. Jarvis\r\ncould not understand. The result of these enquiries can be seen in the\r\nBritish Museum in the shape of a map drawn by Cook from information given\r\nby Tupia. On it are some sentences in the Otaheitan language. CHAPTER 9. 1769 TO 1770. NEW ZEALAND. Leaving the Society Islands on 9th August, they were off Ohetiroa\r\n(Rurutu), in the Central Group, on the 14th, but the natives were\r\nunfriendly, and they did not land. A canoe came out to meet the pinnace\r\nwhich had been sent to obtain information. The occupants, on being\r\npresented with gifts, tried to steal the lot, and were fired over, but by\r\nsome mischance one of the natives was slightly wounded in the head,\r\nwhereupon they hurriedly retreated, and further attempts at communication\r\nwere abandoned. From this place the course was laid to the south to\r\nstrike the much-talked-of Southern Continent. The weather rapidly got\r\ncolder, and the pigs and fowls began to sicken and die. On 26th August\r\nthey celebrated the anniversary of leaving England by cutting a Cheshire\r\ncheese and tapping a cask of porter, which proved excellent. On the 28th an unfortunate death occurred; the boatswain's mate, John\r\nReading, was given some rum by his chief, and it is supposed drunk it off\r\nat once, for he was shortly afterwards found to be very drunk, and was\r\ntaken to his berth, but next morning was past recovery. On 2nd September, in latitude 40 degrees 22 minutes South, the weather\r\nwas very bad, and \"having not the least visible signs of land,\" Cook\r\nagain turned northwards, in order to get better weather and then to push\r\nwest.

Tasman had discovered the west coast in 1642, and had given it the name\r\nof Staten Land, but he never set foot on shore. He was driven away by the\r\nnatives, who killed four of his men, and naming the place Massacre (now\r\nGolden) Bay, he sailed along the north-west coast, giving the headlands\r\nthe names they still bear. Dalrymple held that this land discovered by\r\nTasman was the west coast of the looked-for Terra Australis Incognita,\r\nand his theory was now shattered. LAND IN NEW ZEALAND. Nearing the coast a bay was discovered into which the ship sailed, and\r\nlet go her anchor near the mouth of a small river, not far from where the\r\ntown of Guisborne now stands. Plenty of smoke was seen, showing the\r\ncountry was inhabited, and the pinnace and yawl were manned and armed,\r\nand Cook landed on the east side of the river. Some natives were seen on\r\nthe other side, and, to try to open communications, the yawl, pulled by\r\nfour boys, entered the river, whilst Cook followed up the natives, who\r\nhad retreated towards some huts about 300 yards away. Some Maoris,\r\nthinking the boys would be an easy prey, tried to steal on the yawl, but\r\nthe coxswain of the pinnace observing them called the boat back. One of\r\nthe Maoris raised his spear to throw, and the coxswain fired over his\r\nhead, causing a moment's pause of surprise; but, seeing nothing further,\r\nhe again prepared to throw his spear, so the coxswain shot him, and his\r\nfriends retreated at once, leaving the body behind. Cook at once ordered\r\na return to the ship, as it was now getting dark. The next morning, seeing some men near the same place, Cook again landed\r\nwith Banks, Solander, and an armed party; and Solander went forward to\r\nthe brink of the river to try and speak with the natives, but was\r\nreceived with a threatening waving of spears and a war dance. Cook\r\nretired to the boats, and landing the marines, again advanced with Green,\r\nMonkhouse, and Tupia. The latter spoke to the natives; and, to the great\r\ndelight of the party, found he could make himself understood. After a\r\nlittle parley an unarmed native swam across the river, and was then\r\nfollowed by twenty or thirty more with their arms. Presents were given,\r\nbut they seemed dissatisfied, and wanted arms. At last one stole Green's\r\nhanger, and they all became very aggressive and insolent, whilst more\r\nwere seen to be preparing to cross; so Cook, thinking the position was\r\ngetting too serious, ordered the one who had taken the hanger, and who\r\nwas apparently the leader, to be shot, whereon the rest beat a hasty\r\nretreat. The next day the boats tried to find another landing-place, but the surf\r\nwas too heavy; and when two canoes were seen coming in from the sea, Cook\r\ndetermined to intercept them and try to come to friendly terms. However,\r\nthey would not stop when called on, and on a musket being fired over\r\nthem, the occupants seized their weapons and fiercely attacked the\r\nnearest boat, its crew being compelled to fire in self-defence, and Cook\r\nsays two natives were killed.

The\r\nsuggestion was declined, as they professed to be afraid of being eaten,\r\nand after a time went and hid in some bushes. Cook, noticing several\r\nparties of armed natives advancing in a threatening manner, retired his\r\nwoodcutters across the river. About 150 to 200 Maoris gathered on the\r\nopposite bank. Tupia was put forward to parley, and some presents were\r\nshown, and at length one man came over who received a present from each\r\nof the British and then rejoined his friends. Cook then returned to the\r\nship, taking with him the three youths, who still seemed afraid of their\r\nown countrymen. They were again landed the next morning as the ship was\r\nabout to sail, and though they still professed to be frightened, were\r\nsoon seen walking away in friendly converse with some who had come to\r\nmeet them. NATIVE ACCOUNT. Mr. Polack, a New Zealand resident, gives an account in his New Zealand,\r\nwhich he gathered from the children of natives who were present at the\r\nlanding of Cook. The tribe then living in the neighbourhood were recent\r\narrivals, their leader being Te Ratu--the first man killed by the\r\nEnglish. The natives were anxious to avenge him, but were afraid of the\r\n\"thunderbolts which killed at a long distance,\" some indeed went so far\r\nas to say they felt ill if an Englishman looked at them. The idea of\r\nrevenge was only ended on the vessel leaving. Mr. Polack's chief witness\r\nwas the son of a man who was wounded by a ball in the shoulder, but\r\nsurvived his wound till within a year or two of 1836, the time the\r\ninformation was obtained. Before the ship left, a sort of peace was\r\npatched up by means of presents, and the dead bodies which had been left\r\nwhere they fell, apparently as a protest, were removed. Cook describes the country as a narrow slip of low sand, backed by\r\nwell-wooded hills, rising in the interior into high mountains, on which\r\npatches of snow could be seen. That it was fairly populated was evident\r\nfrom the smoke rising through the trees, more especially in the valleys\r\nleading into Poverty Bay as he named it, because they were unable to get\r\nanything but a small quantity of wood. At Hawke's Bay, whilst trading was going on, a large war canoe came up,\r\nand the occupants received some presents. Cook noticed a man wearing a\r\ncloak of some black skin, and offered a piece of red cloth for it. The\r\nowner took it off, but would not part with it till he received the cloth,\r\nand then his boat was pushed off from the ship, and Cook lost both his\r\ncloak and his cloth. Soon after a determined attempt was made to steal\r\nTupia's boy, Tayeto, who was handing some things down to a canoe; the\r\nMaoris had to be fired on, and in the consequent confusion the boy jumped\r\ninto the water and swam to the ship. The point off which this occurred\r\nwas named Cape Kidnapper. As there was no appearance of a harbour, Cook\r\naltered his course to the north at Cape Turnagain, 40 degrees 34 minutes\r\nSouth, to see if he could not do better in the other direction. All the canoes seen along this coast were well made, far in advance of\r\nanything they had seen before, and the grotesque carving and ornamental\r\nwork was admirably executed. The dresses warn were usually two\r\ncloak-shaped garments, one warn round the shoulders, the other round the\r\nloins, and were made of a substance like hemp, some being very fine. Banks had purchased something like them at Rio de Janeiro, for which he\r\ngave thirty-six shillings, thinking it cheap, but these were as fine, if\r\nnot finer, in texture. Dogs, which were used as food, and rats were the\r\nonly quadrupeds seen.", "sentences": ["Banks says the day is \"the most\r\ndisagreeable my life has yet seen; black be the mark for it, and heaven\r\nsend that such may never return to embitter future reflection.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day a party landed to cut wood, and was accompanied by the three\r\ncaptives, whom they tried to persuade to join their friends.", "The\r\nsuggestion was declined, as they professed to be afraid of being eaten,\r\nand after a time went and hid in some bushes.", "Cook, noticing several\r\nparties of armed natives advancing in a threatening manner, retired his\r\nwoodcutters across the river.", "About 150 to 200 Maoris gathered on the\r\nopposite bank.", "Tupia was put forward to parley, and some presents were\r\nshown, and at length one man came over who received a present from each\r\nof the British and then rejoined his friends.", "Cook then returned to the\r\nship, taking with him the three youths, who still seemed afraid of their\r\nown countrymen.", "They were again landed the next morning as the ship was\r\nabout to sail, and though they still professed to be frightened, were\r\nsoon seen walking away in friendly converse with some who had come to\r\nmeet them.", "NATIVE ACCOUNT.", "Mr.", "Polack, a New Zealand resident, gives an account in his New Zealand,\r\nwhich he gathered from the children of natives who were present at the\r\nlanding of Cook.", "The tribe then living in the neighbourhood were recent\r\narrivals, their leader being Te Ratu--the first man killed by the\r\nEnglish.", "The natives were anxious to avenge him, but were afraid of the\r\n\"thunderbolts which killed at a long distance,\" some indeed went so far\r\nas to say they felt ill if an Englishman looked at them.", "The idea of\r\nrevenge was only ended on the vessel leaving.", "Mr.", "Polack's chief witness\r\nwas the son of a man who was wounded by a ball in the shoulder, but\r\nsurvived his wound till within a year or two of 1836, the time the\r\ninformation was obtained.", "Before the ship left, a sort of peace was\r\npatched up by means of presents, and the dead bodies which had been left\r\nwhere they fell, apparently as a protest, were removed.", "Cook describes the country as a narrow slip of low sand, backed by\r\nwell-wooded hills, rising in the interior into high mountains, on which\r\npatches of snow could be seen.", "That it was fairly populated was evident\r\nfrom the smoke rising through the trees, more especially in the valleys\r\nleading into Poverty Bay as he named it, because they were unable to get\r\nanything but a small quantity of wood.", "At Hawke's Bay, whilst trading was going on, a large war canoe came up,\r\nand the occupants received some presents.", "Cook noticed a man wearing a\r\ncloak of some black skin, and offered a piece of red cloth for it.", "The\r\nowner took it off, but would not part with it till he received the cloth,\r\nand then his boat was pushed off from the ship, and Cook lost both his\r\ncloak and his cloth.", "Soon after a determined attempt was made to steal\r\nTupia's boy, Tayeto, who was handing some things down to a canoe; the\r\nMaoris had to be fired on, and in the consequent confusion the boy jumped\r\ninto the water and swam to the ship.", "The point off which this occurred\r\nwas named Cape Kidnapper.", "As there was no appearance of a harbour, Cook\r\naltered his course to the north at Cape Turnagain, 40 degrees 34 minutes\r\nSouth, to see if he could not do better in the other direction.", "All the canoes seen along this coast were well made, far in advance of\r\nanything they had seen before, and the grotesque carving and ornamental\r\nwork was admirably executed.", "The dresses warn were usually two\r\ncloak-shaped garments, one warn round the shoulders, the other round the\r\nloins, and were made of a substance like hemp, some being very fine.", "Banks had purchased something like them at Rio de Janeiro, for which he\r\ngave thirty-six shillings, thinking it cheap, but these were as fine, if\r\nnot finer, in texture.", "Dogs, which were used as food, and rats were the\r\nonly quadrupeds seen."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_48", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 48)", "language": "it", "content": "Whilst Banks and Solander were collecting, they\r\ndiscovered a large natural arch, which the former describes as the most\r\nmagnificent surprise he had ever met with. It was sketched by Parkinson,\r\nand is engraved in the History. Cook also made a pen-and-ink sketch of\r\nit, which is in the British Museum. COOK'S WASHING STOLEN. On 31st October they rounded East Cape, and following the coast, which\r\ntrended more to the west, they saw a great number of villages and patches\r\nof cultivation, some of the last looking as if freshly ploughed. The\r\nwhole aspect of the country was changing for the better, but the\r\ninhabitants did not seem more peaceably inclined. Five canoes came out to\r\nthe ship fully armed, and apparently bent on mischief. Cook was very\r\nbusy, and did not want them on board, so to keep them off ordered a\r\nmusket to be fired over them; but as it only caused them to stop for a\r\nmoment, a round shot was sent over them, and they hurriedly turned tail. The place was given the name Cape Runaway. White Island was named, but it\r\nmust have been quiescent as there is no note of its being a volcano. As\r\nthey sailed along the coast they met with canoes from which fish,\r\nlobsters, and mussels were purchased, and trading seemed well\r\nestablished, when one gentleman took a fancy to Cook's sheets, which were\r\ntrailing overboard (they were in the wash), and refused to give them up. Muskets were fired over them and they fled, and Cook lost his sheets. From near White Island, Mount Edgecombe was seen, named after the\r\nsergeant of marines. It is a high round mountain, and forms a conspicuous\r\nlandmark on both sides of the North Island. During this day they had\r\nnoticed several small villages perched on difficult eminences and\r\nsurrounded by palisades, which Tupia declared were \"Mories or places of\r\nworship,\" but, says Cook:\r\n\r\n\"I rather think they are places of retreat or strongholds, where they\r\ndefend themselves against the attack of an enemy, as some of them seem'd\r\nnot ill design'd for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nBritish soldiers have since discovered that a Maori Pah is \"not ill\r\ndesigned for that purpose.\" Cook most unfortunately missed the Harbour of\r\nTauranga, the only safe port on the east coast between Auckland and\r\nWellington for ships of any size. NATIVE ACCOUNT. In what is now known as Cook's Bay, they managed to induce the natives to\r\ntrade, and purchased crayfish, over which Parkinson waxes enthusiastic,\r\nand \"Mackerell as good as ever was eat,\" the latter in such large\r\nquantities that they were able to salt a considerable number, thus saving\r\ntheir sea stores. After an observation of a transit of Mercury, in which\r\nthey were not very successful (Wharton thinks they were taken by\r\nsurprise, the transit occurring somewhat earlier than expected; Green\r\nsays: \"Unfortunately for the seamen, their look-out was on the wrong side\r\nof the sun. The end was likewise as grossly mistaken\"), they returned to\r\nthe ship and found that there had been a difficulty with the natives, who\r\nhad assumed a very threatening manner, and one attempted to run off with\r\na piece of calico which was at that time a subject of barter. Mr. Gore\r\nseized a musket and fired, killing his man. Colonel Mundy, in Our\r\nAntipodes, says he saw a man named Taniwha, in 1848, who remembered\r\nCook's visit, and imitated his walk, with the peculiar manner he had of\r\nwaving his right hand, and also told of the kindly way Cook had with the\r\nchildren.", "sentences": ["Whilst Banks and Solander were collecting, they\r\ndiscovered a large natural arch, which the former describes as the most\r\nmagnificent surprise he had ever met with.", "It was sketched by Parkinson,\r\nand is engraved in the History.", "Cook also made a pen-and-ink sketch of\r\nit, which is in the British Museum.", "COOK'S WASHING STOLEN.", "On 31st October they rounded East Cape, and following the coast, which\r\ntrended more to the west, they saw a great number of villages and patches\r\nof cultivation, some of the last looking as if freshly ploughed.", "The\r\nwhole aspect of the country was changing for the better, but the\r\ninhabitants did not seem more peaceably inclined.", "Five canoes came out to\r\nthe ship fully armed, and apparently bent on mischief.", "Cook was very\r\nbusy, and did not want them on board, so to keep them off ordered a\r\nmusket to be fired over them; but as it only caused them to stop for a\r\nmoment, a round shot was sent over them, and they hurriedly turned tail.", "The place was given the name Cape Runaway.", "White Island was named, but it\r\nmust have been quiescent as there is no note of its being a volcano.", "As\r\nthey sailed along the coast they met with canoes from which fish,\r\nlobsters, and mussels were purchased, and trading seemed well\r\nestablished, when one gentleman took a fancy to Cook's sheets, which were\r\ntrailing overboard (they were in the wash), and refused to give them up.", "Muskets were fired over them and they fled, and Cook lost his sheets.", "From near White Island, Mount Edgecombe was seen, named after the\r\nsergeant of marines.", "It is a high round mountain, and forms a conspicuous\r\nlandmark on both sides of the North Island.", "During this day they had\r\nnoticed several small villages perched on difficult eminences and\r\nsurrounded by palisades, which Tupia declared were \"Mories or places of\r\nworship,\" but, says Cook:\r\n\r\n\"I rather think they are places of retreat or strongholds, where they\r\ndefend themselves against the attack of an enemy, as some of them seem'd\r\nnot ill design'd for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nBritish soldiers have since discovered that a Maori Pah is \"not ill\r\ndesigned for that purpose.\" Cook most unfortunately missed the Harbour of\r\nTauranga, the only safe port on the east coast between Auckland and\r\nWellington for ships of any size.", "NATIVE ACCOUNT.", "In what is now known as Cook's Bay, they managed to induce the natives to\r\ntrade, and purchased crayfish, over which Parkinson waxes enthusiastic,\r\nand \"Mackerell as good as ever was eat,\" the latter in such large\r\nquantities that they were able to salt a considerable number, thus saving\r\ntheir sea stores.", "After an observation of a transit of Mercury, in which\r\nthey were not very successful (Wharton thinks they were taken by\r\nsurprise, the transit occurring somewhat earlier than expected; Green\r\nsays: \"Unfortunately for the seamen, their look-out was on the wrong side\r\nof the sun.", "The end was likewise as grossly mistaken\"), they returned to\r\nthe ship and found that there had been a difficulty with the natives, who\r\nhad assumed a very threatening manner, and one attempted to run off with\r\na piece of calico which was at that time a subject of barter.", "Mr.", "Gore\r\nseized a musket and fired, killing his man.", "Colonel Mundy, in Our\r\nAntipodes, says he saw a man named Taniwha, in 1848, who remembered\r\nCook's visit, and imitated his walk, with the peculiar manner he had of\r\nwaving his right hand, and also told of the kindly way Cook had with the\r\nchildren."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_49", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 49)", "language": "it", "content": "Taniwha told Mundy that after the man was shot, the Maoris\r\nlanded, consulted over the body, and decided that as the corpse\r\n\"commenced the quarrel by the theft of the calico, his death should not\r\nbe revenged, but that he should be buried in the cloth which he had paid\r\nfor with his life.\" Colonel Wynyard took down the same story from\r\nTaniwha's lips in 1852, when he was supposed to be about ninety-three,\r\nand says: \"His faculties were little impaired, and his great age\r\nperceptible more from a stoop and grey hairs than any other infirmity.\"\r\nCook expressed very strong disapproval of Mr. Gore's conduct. Next day Cook and Banks explored a river that entered near where they\r\nwere anchored, the east side of which was very barren, but the west was\r\nmuch better, no signs of cultivation showing on either.

A fortified village was visited, the inhabitants good-naturedly\r\nconducting them all over, and showing whatever they expressed a wish to\r\nsee. It was built on a high promontory, whose sides were in some places\r\nquite inaccessible, in others very difficult, except where it faced the\r\nnarrow edge of the hill. Here it was defended by a double ditch and bank,\r\nwith two rows of pickets, the inner row being on the bank, leaving\r\nstanding-room for the defenders. The inner ditch was 24 feet from bottom\r\nto top of the bank. A stage about 30 feet high, 40 feet long, and 6 feet\r\nwide, was erected inside the fence, with a second, a few paces from it,\r\nplaced at right angles; from these the garrison were able to throw their\r\nspears and stones on to the heads of their enemies. The whole village was\r\nsurrounded by a strong picket fence, running close to the edge of the\r\nhill. The entire surface of the top of the hill was cut up into small\r\nsquares, each surrounded by its own fence, and communicating by narrow\r\nlanes, with little gateways, so that if the outer defences were forced\r\neach square could be defended in turn. Cook says:\r\n\r\n\"I look upon it to be a very strong and well choose Post, and where a\r\nsmall number of resolute men might defend themselves a long time against\r\na vast superior force, armed in the manner as these people are.\"\r\n\r\nHe noticed, with quick eye, the great failing in these native fortresses,\r\nthat is, the want of storage for water. In these Maori villages it was\r\nremarked that sanitary arrangements were provided, such as, says Beckmann\r\nin his History of Inventions, did not exist in the palace of the King of\r\nSpain at that time. Large quantities of iron sand were noted here, but the use was quite\r\nunknown to the natives, who were indifferent to the iron tools or spikes\r\nwhich had hitherto been such a valuable medium of exchange elsewhere.

No great increase of depth being found, the pinnace and long-boat went up\r\na river about 9 miles away, and on account of a fancied resemblance named\r\nit the Thames. They landed at a village near the mouth, being well\r\nreceived, but desiring to take advantage of the flood-tide which ran \"as\r\nstrong as it does in the River Thames below bridge,\" they made no stay;\r\nthey went up about 14 miles, and then, finding little alteration in the\r\nappearance of the country, landed to inspect some large trees of a kind\r\nthey had previously noticed.

When the wind\r\ndropped, what was left was against them, and the Endeavour would only go\r\nwith the tide, so Cook took a run ashore to the west side of the bay, but\r\nsaw nothing of interest, and concluded it was but sparsely inhabited.

On the 14th, thinking he was in the entrance of a large bay, Cook ran in\r\nunder the southern coast, and finding it broken into promising-looking\r\nbays, determined to run into one and careen the ship, as she was very\r\nfoul; it is now called Ship Cove, in Queen Charlotte's Sound.

Some\r\nnatives also came off with fish, and though it was not good, Cook ordered\r\nit to be bought, in order to open up trade with them.

The population of the district was estimated at only some three or four\r\nhundred, and appeared to subsist on fish and fern roots. They were\r\nevidently poorer than those seen previously, and their canoes are\r\ndescribed as \"mean and almost without ornament.\" They soon understood the\r\nvalue of iron, and readily took spike nails when trading, and greatly\r\npreferred \"Kersey and Broadcloth to the Otaheite cloth, which show'd them\r\nto be a more sensible people than many of their neighbours,\" says Cook. An old man, who had previously paid several visits, complained that one\r\nof the ships boats had fired on and wounded two Maoris, one of whom was\r\nsince dead. On enquiry, Cook found that the Master and five petty\r\nofficers, fishing beyond the usual limits, were approached by two canoes\r\nin what they thought was a threatening manner and had fired to keep them\r\noff. A second native assured Cook no death had occurred, and enquiry\r\nfailed to discover one; but Cook very severely condemned the action of\r\nhis men as totally unjustifiable. The ship had, by this time, been\r\nbrought into fairly good trim, being clean, freshly caulked and tarred,\r\nand broken ironwork all repaired, so preparations were made to push\r\nthrough the straits; but, before leaving, two posts were set up, one near\r\nthe watering place, and the other on the island, Motuara, on which the\r\nname of the ship and the date of the visit had been cut, and possession\r\nwas taken of this land, the king's health being drunk, and the empty\r\nbottle presented to the old man who had complained about the shooting,\r\nand who was greatly delighted with his present; he also was given some\r\nsilver threepenny pieces, dated 1763, and spike nails marked with the\r\nbroad arrow.

The opinion was expressed that European fruits, grain, etc., would grow\r\nwell in New Zealand, and an agricultural population would be successful. Timber of excellent quality was plentiful, and it was believed that New\r\nZealand flax promised to be of considerable commercial value.

Tupia had no difficulty in\r\nmaking himself understood. It would seem that even at this time founding a colony in the southern\r\nhemisphere had been under discussion, for Cook says that if a settlement\r\nwere decided on in New Zealand, he would recommend the Estuary of the\r\nThames and the Bay of Islands as most suitable for the purpose. Speaking of his chart of New Zealand, Cook points out frankly the places\r\nwhere he thinks he may have fallen into error, and gives his reasons for\r\nso thinking, and the opinions of others are worth recording. A DULL SAILOR. Admiral Wharton says:\r\n\r\n\"Never has a coast been as well laid down by a first explorer, and it\r\nmust have required unceasing vigilance and continual observation in fair\r\nweather and foul, to arrive at such a satisfactory conclusion, and with\r\nsuch a dull sailor as the Endeavour was, the six and a half months\r\noccupied in the work (2,400 miles of coast) must be counted as a short\r\ninterval in which to do it.\"\r\n\r\nM. Crozet, second to M. Marion du Fresne in command of the French\r\nexpedition that was out in the following year, says:\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I obtained information of the voyage of Cook, I carefully\r\ncompared the chart I had prepared of that part of the coast of New\r\nZealand along which we had coasted, with that prepared by Captain Cook\r\nand his officers.

The next thing to be done was to decide the course to be taken towards\r\nEngland. Cook would have liked to have returned by the Horn and thus\r\nsettle the existence or non-existence of a large body of land in the\r\nSouth Pacific, but the time of year and the condition of his ship\r\nsuggested that would be to court disaster. The same reasons held good\r\nagainst a direct course to the Cape of Good Hope, with the added\r\ndisadvantage of there being no probability of any fresh discoveries, as\r\nthat part of the Ocean had been frequently traversed. \"It was therefore resolved to return by way of the East Indies by the\r\nfollowing route.", "sentences": ["In Admiralty Bay, which he entered to refit for the homeward voyage, the\r\nsails were found to require a thorough overhaul, for, as Banks says,\r\nthey:\r\n\r\n\"were ill-provided from the first, and were now worn and damaged by the\r\nrough work they had gone through, particularly on the New Zealand coast,\r\nand they gave no little trouble to get into order again.\"\r\n\r\nThe two points forming the bay were appropriately named after the\r\nSecretaries of the Admiralty, Stephens and Jackson.", "The opinion was expressed that European fruits, grain, etc., would grow\r\nwell in New Zealand, and an agricultural population would be successful.", "Timber of excellent quality was plentiful, and it was believed that New\r\nZealand flax promised to be of considerable commercial value.", "Fish was\r\nfound in great quantities, the lobsters and oysters being specially\r\nremarkable for quality and quantity.", "No quadrupeds except dogs and rats\r\nwere seen, and birds did not seem very plentiful.", "The minerals, in Cook's\r\nopinion, did not appear of much value, but he admitted that he was not an\r\nauthority on the subject.", "Banks notes the southern islanders appeared to\r\nbe an inferior race to those of the north, the latter probably more\r\nclosely allied to the Otaheitan type;

It was a course\r\nlaid down after thorough consideration of the best charts, very poor at\r\nbest, in his possession. BOTANY BAY. The good ship Endeavour got under way on 31st March 1770, with a\r\nfavourable wind and clear sky, heading a little north of west. On the\r\n16th a change in the birds denoted the neighbourhood of land, and after a\r\ntouch of contrary wind, on 19th April 1770 Lieutenant Hicks sighted land\r\nextending from north-east to west, distant five or six leagues. This was\r\nthe looked-for east coast of New Holland, and the ship was at the\r\nentrance of Bass Straits, but on his chart Cook shows by a dotted line\r\nthat he felt uncertain whether van Diemen's Land was joined to New\r\nHolland or no. The low hill which was first seen was named Point Hicks\r\nafter its discoverer, and its position is given as 38 degrees 0 minutes\r\nSouth, 211 degrees 7 minutes West. Three waterspouts were seen a short\r\ndistance from the ship, and are remarkable as being the first ones\r\nmentioned in the log. The course was altered to the north, and the\r\ncountry is described as rather low, not very hilly, covered with green\r\nwoods, and the shore of white sand. Cape Howe was named the following\r\nday, and the position fixed as 37 degrees 28 minutes South, 210 degrees 3\r\nminutes West, which Wharton says is almost exact. The country now\r\nappeared to be improving in character, and smoke proved the existence of\r\ninhabitants, but none were visible till Cape Dromedary and Bateman's Bay\r\nwere passed, when some were seen on the shore, but too far away for\r\nobservation. Cook wished to land at Jervis Bay, but the wind was against\r\nhim, and he could not afford time to beat in. An attempt was\r\nunsuccessfully made at a place that has been identified a little north of\r\nFive Islands, near Illawarra, but the surf was too heavy. At daylight on\r\nSunday, 29th April, a bay was discovered, and the Master was sent in to\r\nsound the entrance, the ship following closely, and soon the Endeavour\r\nanchored for the first time in Australian waters, about two miles within\r\nthe entrance of Sting Ray, now Botany, Bay. (For note see below.) The\r\ntime when the name of the Bay was changed has been much disputed, but it\r\nis probable it was done some time after leaving the place. It was called\r\nSting Ray on account of the big haul of that fish made soon after their\r\narrival and the name stands in all the logs; Banks refers to it under\r\nthat name in a general description of the country, written when leaving\r\nCape York. Cook is however, decisive, for under date 6th May he says:\r\n\"The great quantity of plants Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found in this\r\nplace occasioned my giving it the name of Botany Bay.\"\r\n\r\nOn coming to an anchor, Cook, Banks, and Tupia went on shore, and Canon\r\nBennett, a second cousin of Mrs. Cook's, and one who knew her personally,\r\nrelates that the family legend was that on reaching the shore Cook\r\nordered the midshipman to \"Jump out, Isaac,\" and Isaac Smith (afterwards\r\nAdmiral) also a cousin of Mrs. Cook's, was the first Englishman to set\r\nhis foot on the soil of New South Wales. The few natives who were near\r\nran away, excepting two, who came forward to oppose any landing. A musket\r\nwas fired over them, and they retired to where they had left their\r\nspears, and then one threw a stone at the boat, and as they were too far\r\naway for any serious damage to be done, Cook fired a charge of small shot\r\nat him.", "sentences": ["Upon leaving this coast to the Westward until we fall in\r\nwith the East coast of New Holland, and then to follow the direction of\r\nthat coast to the Northward or what other direction it might take us,\r\nuntil we arrive at its Northern extremity; and if it should be found\r\nimpracticable then to Endeavour to fall in with the Land or Islands\r\ndiscovered by Quiros.\"\r\n\r\nThis extract from Cook's Journal shows that he made no claim to the\r\ndiscovery of Australia, and settles the stupid story that his connection\r\nwith the discovery of the east coast was an accident.", "It was a course\r\nlaid down after thorough consideration of the best charts, very poor at\r\nbest, in his possession.", "BOTANY BAY.", "The good ship Endeavour got under way on 31st March 1770, with a\r\nfavourable wind and clear sky, heading a little north of west.", "On the\r\n16th a change in the birds denoted the neighbourhood of land, and after a\r\ntouch of contrary wind, on 19th April 1770 Lieutenant Hicks sighted land\r\nextending from north-east to west, distant five or six leagues.", "This was\r\nthe looked-for east coast of New Holland, and the ship was at the\r\nentrance of Bass Straits, but on his chart Cook shows by a dotted line\r\nthat he felt uncertain whether van Diemen's Land was joined to New\r\nHolland or no.", "The low hill which was first seen was named Point Hicks\r\nafter its discoverer, and its position is given as 38 degrees 0 minutes\r\nSouth, 211 degrees 7 minutes West.", "Three waterspouts were seen a short\r\ndistance from the ship, and are remarkable as being the first ones\r\nmentioned in the log.", "The course was altered to the north, and the\r\ncountry is described as rather low, not very hilly, covered with green\r\nwoods, and the shore of white sand.", "Cape Howe was named the following\r\nday, and the position fixed as 37 degrees 28 minutes South, 210 degrees 3\r\nminutes West, which Wharton says is almost exact.", "The country now\r\nappeared to be improving in character, and smoke proved the existence of\r\ninhabitants, but none were visible till Cape Dromedary and Bateman's Bay\r\nwere passed, when some were seen on the shore, but too far away for\r\nobservation.", "Cook wished to land at Jervis Bay, but the wind was against\r\nhim, and he could not afford time to beat in.", "An attempt was\r\nunsuccessfully made at a place that has been identified a little north of\r\nFive Islands, near Illawarra, but the surf was too heavy.", "At daylight on\r\nSunday, 29th April, a bay was discovered, and the Master was sent in to\r\nsound the entrance, the ship following closely, and soon the Endeavour\r\nanchored for the first time in Australian waters, about two miles within\r\nthe entrance of Sting Ray, now Botany, Bay.", "(For note see below.)

As Banks, suspicious of some\r\ngummy substance on the points of the spears, suggested poison, they were\r\nnot followed up. The huts, found near the landing-place, were constructed\r\nof sticks covered with pieces of bark somewhat similar to those seen in\r\nTierra del Fuego. Some children found carefully covered up were left\r\nundisturbed, but forty or fifty spears were taken, and payment in the\r\nshape of beads, cloth, nails, etc., was left, but still untouched, on\r\nvisiting the camp the next morning. The canoes from which the natives\r\nwere seen fishing are described by Cook as the worst he ever saw, being\r\nmerely sheets of bark tied with withies at the end and kept open in the\r\nmiddle by a stick. Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining water, and whilst\r\nthe crew were procuring it, Cook made a survey of the harbour. He\r\ndescribes the country as lightly timbered, with a sandy soil growing a\r\nplentiful crop of coarse grass, of which a quantity was cut for the\r\nsheep. The soil was interspersed with rocks and swamps, but at the head\r\nof the bay appeared richer. A few natives were seen, who ran away when\r\nobserved, and though one or two spears were thrown no damage was done to\r\nany one. Large heaps of oyster, mussel, and cockle shells were found,\r\namongst them, says Cook, \"being some of the largest oyster shells I ever\r\nsaw.\" An account, said to have been obtained from the blacks, published\r\nin a work on Australian discovery (anonymous, Sydney), agrees as far as\r\nit goes with those of Cook and Banks, and it is almost unnecessary to say\r\nthe ship was at first taken for a large bird. SUTHERLAND'S DEATH. Whilst here, a seaman named Forbes (Forby, in the Muster Roll)\r\nSutherland, died of consumption, from which he had suffered throughout\r\nthe voyage, was buried on shore, and the point named Point Sutherland in\r\nhis memory. The anonymous pamphlet referred to above, says that Cook does\r\nnot give the cause of Sutherland's death, and that he had been fatally\r\nwounded by the blacks whilst trying to secure a metal plate he had found\r\naffixed to a tree, recording that the Dutch had previously been on the\r\nspot. The pamphlet goes on to say that Cook suppressed these facts in\r\norder to have the credit of being the first discoverer, but that the\r\nplate had been secured by some one and deposited in the British Museum. Unfortunately, Cook does give the cause of Sutherland's death, and the\r\nplate is not in the British Museum, nor has it ever been heard of there. Before leaving, an inscription was cut on a tree near the watering place,\r\ngiving the ship's name and date; the English colours were displayed on\r\nshore every day during their stay, but they could not establish any\r\nfriendly intercourse with the blacks. A plate has since been attached to\r\nthe rocks about fifteen feet above high water, and as near as possible to\r\nthe supposed place of landing. After leaving Botany Bay the coast was followed up to the north, and Cook\r\nnoted an \"entrance\" which he thought might prove a safe anchorage, to\r\nwhich he gave the name of Port Jackson, after Mr. George Jackson, one of\r\nthe Secretaries to the Admiralty. Within this entrance is now the city of\r\nSydney, and it was to this place that Captain Phillip removed his\r\nheadquarters when he had discovered the unsuitability of Botany Bay for\r\nsettlement. Broken Bay, named from the number of small islands therein,\r\nwas passed, and the voyage was rendered very slow by the light northerly\r\nwinds, and passing Cape Hawke, he found the set of the current had placed\r\nhim twelve miles in advance, when reckoned by the log, of his real\r\nposition given by observation.", "sentences": ["He then ran off to a small hut near, picked up a wooden shield,\r\nand returned to take up his position alongside his comrade, and they\r\nthrew a couple of spears, receiving a second discharge of small shot in\r\nreturn, which caused them to retire slowly.", "As Banks, suspicious of some\r\ngummy substance on the points of the spears, suggested poison, they were\r\nnot followed up.", "The huts, found near the landing-place, were constructed\r\nof sticks covered with pieces of bark somewhat similar to those seen in\r\nTierra del Fuego.", "Some children found carefully covered up were left\r\nundisturbed, but forty or fifty spears were taken, and payment in the\r\nshape of beads, cloth, nails, etc., was left, but still untouched, on\r\nvisiting the camp the next morning.", "The canoes from which the natives\r\nwere seen fishing are described by Cook as the worst he ever saw, being\r\nmerely sheets of bark tied with withies at the end and kept open in the\r\nmiddle by a stick.", "Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining water, and whilst\r\nthe crew were procuring it, Cook made a survey of the harbour.", "He\r\ndescribes the country as lightly timbered, with a sandy soil growing a\r\nplentiful crop of coarse grass, of which a quantity was cut for the\r\nsheep.", "The soil was interspersed with rocks and swamps, but at the head\r\nof the bay appeared richer.", "A few natives were seen, who ran away when\r\nobserved, and though one or two spears were thrown no damage was done to\r\nany one.", "Large heaps of oyster, mussel, and cockle shells were found,\r\namongst them, says Cook, \"being some of the largest oyster shells I ever\r\nsaw.\" An account, said to have been obtained from the blacks, published\r\nin a work on Australian discovery (anonymous, Sydney), agrees as far as\r\nit goes with those of Cook and Banks, and it is almost unnecessary to say\r\nthe ship was at first taken for a large bird.", "SUTHERLAND'S DEATH.", "Whilst here, a seaman named Forbes (Forby, in the Muster Roll)\r\nSutherland, died of consumption, from which he had suffered throughout\r\nthe voyage, was buried on shore, and the point named Point Sutherland in\r\nhis memory.", "The anonymous pamphlet referred to above, says that Cook does\r\nnot give the cause of Sutherland's death, and that he had been fatally\r\nwounded by the blacks whilst trying to secure a metal plate he had found\r\naffixed to a tree, recording that the Dutch had previously been on the\r\nspot.", "The pamphlet goes on to say that Cook suppressed these facts in\r\norder to have the credit of being the first discoverer, but that the\r\nplate had been secured by some one and deposited in the British Museum.", "Unfortunately, Cook does give the cause of Sutherland's death, and the\r\nplate is not in the British Museum, nor has it ever been heard of there.", "Before leaving, an inscription was cut on a tree near the watering place,\r\ngiving the ship's name and date; the English colours were displayed on\r\nshore every day during their stay, but they could not establish any\r\nfriendly intercourse with the blacks.", "A plate has since been attached to\r\nthe rocks about fifteen feet above high water, and as near as possible to\r\nthe supposed place of landing.", "After leaving Botany Bay the coast was followed up to the north, and Cook\r\nnoted an \"entrance\" which he thought might prove a safe anchorage, to\r\nwhich he gave the name of Port Jackson, after Mr.", "George Jackson, one of\r\nthe Secretaries to the Admiralty.", "Within this entrance is now the city of\r\nSydney, and it was to this place that Captain Phillip removed his\r\nheadquarters when he had discovered the unsuitability of Botany Bay for\r\nsettlement.", "Broken Bay, named from the number of small islands therein,\r\nwas passed, and the voyage was rendered very slow by the light northerly\r\nwinds, and passing Cape Hawke, he found the set of the current had placed\r\nhim twelve miles in advance, when reckoned by the log, of his real\r\nposition given by observation."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_58", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 58)", "language": "it", "content": "Almost the only thing to be seen beyond the outline of the coast was the\r\nconstantly recurring smoke; one point received the name of Smoky Cape on\r\naccount of the great quantity seen in its vicinity.

That these \"smokes\" are used by the blacks as a means of\r\ncommunication is a well recognised fact, and the news they can convey by\r\nthis means is perfectly astonishing to a white man. The country appeared to increase in height with:\r\n\r\n\"an agreeable variety of Hills, Ridges, and Valleys, and large plains all\r\nclothed with wood, which to all appearance is the same as I have before\r\nmentioned as we could discover no visible difference in the soil.\"\r\n\r\nAfter escaping a reef off Point Danger they discovered a bay, which Cook\r\ncalled Morton Bay after the Earl of Morton, P.R.S.; now wrongly spelt as\r\nMoreton Bay.

At the same time some curiously-shaped hills were\r\ngiven the name of the Glasshouses, from their resemblance to the\r\nbuildings in which glass is manufactured, and the resemblance is most\r\nstriking. After rounding Breaksea Spit, Cook found himself in a large bay, and\r\nconjectured, from the birds and the direction of their flight, that there\r\nwas fresh water to the south-west; and rightly, for here the Mary River\r\nenters Hervey's Bay. On 23rd May they landed for the second time, and\r\nCook says this was \"visibly worse than the last place,\" that is Botany\r\nBay. They managed to shoot a bustard of 17 1/2 pounds, and Banks says it\r\nwas \"as large as a good turkey, and far the best we had eaten since we\r\nleft England.\" It was so much appreciated that its name was conferred on\r\nBustard Head and Bustard Bay. This bird is known in Australia as the\r\nPlain Turkey. Oysters of good quality were also obtained, and Banks made\r\nthe personal acquaintance of the green tree ant and the Australian\r\nmosquito, neither of which were appreciated. CAPE CAPRICORN. On 24th May a moderately high, white, barren-looking point was passed,\r\nwhich being found by observation to be directly under the tropic was\r\nnamed Cape Capricorn, and soon after the mouth of the Fitzroy was\r\ncrossed, with the remark from Cook that from general appearances he\r\nbelieved there was a river in the immediate vicinity. Soundings becoming\r\nvery irregular, he ran out between the Keppel Islands, on one of which\r\nnatives were seen. Cape Townshend was named after Charles Townshend, one\r\nof the Lords of the Admiralty when the Endeavour left England, and not\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, as stated by Wharton. Rounding the point into Shoalwater Bay they had to haul sharp up to the\r\nwest to get within the Northumberland Islands, and the water was found to\r\nbe so shallow that they anchored and sounded from the boats, gradually\r\nworking nearer in, as Cook was anxious to clean the ship's bottom, which\r\nwas very foul; and he desired to take advantage of the full moon in these\r\ndangerous waters. They landed to take some observations and look for\r\nwater. The observations were unsatisfactory, for the compass was\r\nunreliable, a fault attributed to the ironstone in the neighbourhood, of\r\nwhich signs were very evident, and water was not to be found. The country\r\nis reported on as follows: \"No signs of fertility is to be seen upon the\r\nLand; the soil of the uplands is mostly a hard, reddish clay.\"\r\n\r\nPassing Cape Hillsborough, they entered Whitsunday Passage, described by\r\nCook as \"one continued safe harbour, besides a number of small bays and\r\ncoves on each side, where ships might lay as it were in a Basin.\" The\r\nland on both sides was green and pleasant-looking, but on account of the\r\nmoonlight Cook could not waste any time in landing.", "sentences": ["Almost the only thing to be seen beyond the outline of the coast was the\r\nconstantly recurring smoke;

On 10th June, after leaving a small bay north of Cape Grafton, where they\r\nhad searched in vain for a watering place, the watch had just turned in,\r\nthe lead had been cast and given seventeen fathoms, when the unfortunate\r\nship brought all hands on deck, with a crash on a sunken rock. Soundings\r\ntaken all round showed her to be on the very edge of a coral reef. Making\r\nbut little water, an attempt was made to warp her off, but\r\nunsuccessfully. Steps were then taken to lighten her; decayed stores, oil\r\njars, staves, casks, ballast, and her six quarter-deck guns were thrown\r\noverboard, some forty to fifty tons, but with no effect. The tide now\r\nrising, the leaks increased rapidly, two pumps being kept constantly at\r\nwork. Thinking things could only go from bad to worse, Cook determined to\r\nheave her off at all hazards, and every one who could be spared from the\r\npumps was sent to the capstan or windlass, and at length, after a stay of\r\ntwenty-three hours on the rocks, she was hove into deep water. Now,\r\nhowever, it was a case of all hands to the pumps, and for a time it\r\nseemed as if they were slowly gaining on the in-rushing water, but\r\nsuddenly there was an increase reported in the well, casting a shadow of\r\ngloom over all, but not for an instant staying the steady beat of the\r\npumps. Shortly it was discovered that a fresh hand had been sent to the\r\nwell and had sounded from a different mark than his predecessor,\r\naccounting for the sixteen to eighteen inches difference in the depth of\r\nwater reported. This discovery acted like a charm: each one redoubled his\r\nexertions, and by morning they had gained considerably on the leak, so\r\nsail was made, and they slowly crawled in towards the land. Midshipman Monkhouse had been on a ship which was leaking at the rate of\r\nforty-eight inches per hour, and had seen the operation called\r\n\"fothering\" so successfully performed on her, that, without further\r\nrepair, she had sailed from Virginia to London. This being brought to\r\nCook's ear, he gave Monkhouse the charge of carrying out a similar\r\nexperiment. A studding sail was taken, on which oakum and wool was\r\nlightly sewn and smothered with dirt; it was then lowered over the bows\r\nand dragged by ropes over the place where the worst of the leak was\r\nsituated, and there secured, with the result, according to Banks, that in\r\na quarter of an hour after it was in position they were able to pump the\r\nship clear, and Cook says one pump was sufficient to keep her free. Of the conduct of the crew, Cook says:\r\n\r\n\"In justice to the ship's company, I must say that no men ever behaved\r\nbetter than they have done on this occasion; animated by the behaviour of\r\nevery Gentleman on board, every man seem'd to have a just sense of the\r\nDanger we were in, and exerted himself to the very utmost.\"\r\n\r\nBanks adds his testimony:\r\n\r\n\"Every man exerts his utmost for the preservation of the ship.

In hopes of getting a better view Cook went\r\nout to Lizard Island, and from there could see, far away to the east, the\r\nwhite breakers on the Great Barrier Reef. This island, on which the only\r\nliving things to be seen were lizards, they found, from the large piles\r\nof shells and remains of fires, was visited periodically by the blacks; a\r\nremarkable voyage for their miserable canoes. Having only three months' supplies at short allowance left, Cook, after a\r\nconsultation with his officers, made out through an opening in the\r\nBarrier Reef that he had seen from Lizard Island, and observes:\r\n\r\n\"Having been entangled among Islands and Shoals more or less ever since\r\nthe 26th May, in which time we have sailed 360 leagues by the Lead,\r\nwithout ever having a Leadsman out of the chains, when the ship was under\r\nsail, a Circumstance that perhaps never happened to any ship before, and\r\nyet it was here absolutely necessary.\"\r\n\r\nBut their satisfaction in getting outside was diminished when it was\r\nfound that the increased working of the ship's timbers necessitated the\r\ncontinual use of one pump. Cook was afraid that being forced outside the Barrier Reef he would be\r\nunable to put to the proof the opinion he had formed that New Guinea and\r\nNew Holland were not joined. He did not know till after his return to\r\nEngland, that the point had already been settled in 1606, by Louis Vaez\r\nde Torres, and he readily yields the honour of the discovery in the\r\nIntroduction to his Second Voyage. The log of Torres's voyage was lost\r\nfor many years, and was found at Manilla, when that place was taken by\r\nAdmiral Cornish in 1762. Cook had with him a copy of De Brye's Voyages,\r\npublished in 1756, which contained three charts that he found to be\r\n\"tolerably good\" with regard to New Guinea, and he evidently formed the\r\nopinion that both the Spaniards and the Dutch had circumnavigated that\r\nisland. \"I always understood, before I had a sight of these maps, that it was\r\nunknown whether or no New Holland and New Guinea was one continued land,\r\nand so it is said in the very History of Voyages these maps are bound up\r\nin.

To judge from his own Journal, he must have\r\nbeen rather a difficult man to get on with, but his services as observer\r\nwere invaluable, and he at all times and seasons was devoted to his\r\nspecial duty: indeed, at times he appears to have thought that every\r\nother work should give way to his. It is a somewhat suggestive fact that\r\nBanks hardly makes any reference to Mr. Green throughout his Journal. On\r\n27th February the terrible list of losses was closed by the deaths of\r\nthree of the crew, making in all thirty deaths since their arrival at\r\nBatavia.

On 6th March land was sighted at daylight, about two leagues away, near\r\nCape Natal, and on the 15th the Cape of Good Hope was seen. The first\r\nthing to be done was to provide shelter ashore for his sick, of whom he\r\nlanded twenty-eight, and during the stay the remainder of the crew were\r\ngiven every possible opportunity of being on land, as Cook recognised the\r\nvalue of an entire change of life in shaking off the remnants of\r\nsickness. He lost three more of his men here, and hearing from a Dutch\r\nship just in from Europe that war was threatening between England and\r\nSpain, he hurried up his preparations for departure and got all his men\r\non board, though some were still very ill. In addition he managed to\r\nenter some half-dozen men for the voyage home. In writing of the Cape, Cook draws attention to the fact:\r\n\r\n\"that a stranger is at once struck with surprise and disappointment, for\r\nno country we have seen this voyage affords so barren a prospect as this,\r\nand not only so in appearance but in reality.\"\r\n\r\nThen further on he says:\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the many disadvantages this country labours under, such\r\nis the industry, economy, and good management of the Dutch, that not only\r\nthe necessary, but all the Luxuries of Life are raised here in great\r\nabundance, and are sold as cheap, if not cheaper, than in any part of\r\nEurope, some few articles excepted.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he complains of the exorbitant charges made by the\r\nDutch East India Company for naval stores. As at Batavia, they were sold\r\nat a certain fixed price from which there was no deviation. Calling in at St. Helena, they found H.M.Ss. Portland and Swallow, with a\r\nconvoy, in the roads, and received some few much-needed stores from them,\r\ntogether with the information that all danger of war between Spain and\r\nEngland was over. They all sailed in company on 5th May, but after a few\r\ndays Cook explained to Captain Elliott, of the Portland, who had come on\r\nboard the Endeavour, that his ship, sails, and rigging were naturally not\r\nin very good order after his lengthy voyage, and therefore he should\r\nprobably be unable to keep up with the other ships. He requested the\r\nPortland to take charge of letters, charts, and journals for the\r\nAdmiralty. These papers only arrived in England three days in advance of\r\nthe Endeavour. For some days the good Bark kept within easy reach of the\r\nfleet, and was able to obtain extra medical advice for Mr. Hicks, who was\r\nsuffering from consumption when he left England, but had held out well\r\ntill stricken with the Batavian fever, when he gradually sank and died on\r\n25th May; Mr. Charles Clerke was appointed third lieutenant, in place of\r\nMr. Gore, promoted. Since leaving the Cape they had also lost their\r\nMaster, Mr. Molineaux, of whose intelligence Cook speaks very highly, but\r\ndeplores his want of steadiness, the true cause of his early death.

A Mr. Hayden purchased the\r\nold ship from a Dunkirk firm and re-christened her La Liberte, loaded her\r\nwith oil and consigned her, under French colours, to Gibbs and Canning at\r\nNewport. She was chased by an English ship, but escaped, and after laying\r\nalongside a wharf for some months received a cargo, but running aground\r\nin trying to leave the harbour, she was found in such a bad condition\r\nthat she was allowed to remain to drop to pieces. Enquiries into this\r\nstory gave satisfactory results, and a box made from her timbers was\r\npresented to J. Fennimore Cooper, the American author, with letters\r\nauthenticating, as far as possible, the vessel from which the wood had\r\nbeen taken. Miss Cooper mentions this box in her preface to her father's\r\nRed Rover, and several other relics of the old ship are still to be found\r\nin the neighbourhood of Newport. CHAPTER 12. 1771. PREPARATIONS FOR SECOND VOYAGE. After reporting himself to the Admiralty on his arrival in England, Cook\r\nproceeded to his home at Mile End Old Town, where he was for some time\r\nemployed in completing his Charts and Journals, and on 14th August, the\r\nAnnual Register announces, he was introduced to His Majesty at St. James's, when he:\r\n\r\n\"presented his Journal of his Voyage, with some curious maps and charts\r\nof different places that he had drawn during the voyage; he was presented\r\nwith a captain's commission.\"\r\n\r\nHe also found time to write two long and instructive letters to his old\r\nmaster and good friend, Mr. John Walker of Whitby, which are to be found\r\nin Dr. Young's work. They give a rapid glance at the different places\r\nvisited, with a few pithy remarks as to their peoples and productions;\r\nmention the pleasing reception he had from the king, and he alludes to\r\nthe probability of being despatched on a second voyage with two ships. Edgeworth, in his Memoirs, states that about this time Cook was a\r\nfrequent visitor at Denham Place, the home of Mr. Louis Way, F.R.S., but\r\nas that gentleman died in this year, and Edgeworth also refers to events\r\nof a later date as occurring at the same time, it is more probable that\r\nthese visits were paid after the Second Voyage to Mr. Benjamin Way, also\r\nF.R.S., and a Director of the South Sea Company. In another place\r\nEdgeworth infers that Banks, Solander, and Cook were members of a club\r\nwhich met at Slaughter's Coffee House in 1765. Of course, this is an\r\nerror, for Cook was then engaged in Newfoundland, and unknown to the\r\nRoyal Society, whose members composed the club spoken of; in fact, Cook,\r\nthough a frequent guest in after times, was never a member of the Royal\r\nSocieties Club. Fanny Burney (Madame d'Arblay) says that in September her father, Dr. Charles Burney, spent a few days at Hinchinbroke, Lord Sandwich's place,\r\nin order to meet Cook, Banks, and Solander, and it is evident that the\r\nsecond voyage had been resolved on, for Dr.", "sentences": ["The good ship which had so bravely borne her part, was not given much\r\nrest; but after being paid off at Woolwich, was despatched, under\r\nlieutenant James Gordon, to the Falkland Islands on 16th October, and\r\nreturned with \"perishable and unserviceable\" stores; in 1772 and 1773 she\r\nagain made voyages to the same destination, the last one to bring away\r\nthe garrison and stores, as those islands were to be handed over to\r\nSpain.", "She was paid off at Woolwich in September 1774, and shortly\r\nafterwards was sold out of the Navy for the sum of 645 pounds.", "She is\r\nthen believed to have been employed as a collier in the North Seas.", "Mr.", "Gibbs, of the firm of Gibbs and Canning of Newport, Rhode Island, one day\r\npointed out to the English Consul the remains of an old vessel falling\r\ninto decay, and informed him that it was Captain Cook's ship, the\r\nEndeavour.", "His story was that the French Government being anxious to\r\ncompete with England in the whale fishery, offered a bounty to the ships\r\nin that trade sailing under the French flag.", "A Mr.", "Hayden purchased the\r\nold ship from a Dunkirk firm and re-christened her La Liberte, loaded her\r\nwith oil and consigned her, under French colours, to Gibbs and Canning at\r\nNewport.", "She was chased by an English ship, but escaped, and after laying\r\nalongside a wharf for some months received a cargo, but running aground\r\nin trying to leave the harbour, she was found in such a bad condition\r\nthat she was allowed to remain to drop to pieces.", "Enquiries into this\r\nstory gave satisfactory results, and a box made from her timbers was\r\npresented to J.", "Fennimore Cooper, the American author, with letters\r\nauthenticating, as far as possible, the vessel from which the wood had\r\nbeen taken.", "Miss Cooper mentions this box in her preface to her father's\r\nRed Rover, and several other relics of the old ship are still to be found\r\nin the neighbourhood of Newport.", "CHAPTER 12.", "1771.", "PREPARATIONS FOR SECOND VOYAGE.", "After reporting himself to the Admiralty on his arrival in England, Cook\r\nproceeded to his home at Mile End Old Town, where he was for some time\r\nemployed in completing his Charts and Journals, and on 14th August, the\r\nAnnual Register announces, he was introduced to His Majesty at St.", "James's, when he:\r\n\r\n\"presented his Journal of his Voyage, with some curious maps and charts\r\nof different places that he had drawn during the voyage; he was presented\r\nwith a captain's commission.\"\r\n\r\nHe also found time to write two long and instructive letters to his old\r\nmaster and good friend, Mr.", "John Walker of Whitby, which are to be found\r\nin Dr.", "Young's work.", "They give a rapid glance at the different places\r\nvisited, with a few pithy remarks as to their peoples and productions;\r\nmention the pleasing reception he had from the king, and he alludes to\r\nthe probability of being despatched on a second voyage with two ships.", "Edgeworth, in his Memoirs, states that about this time Cook was a\r\nfrequent visitor at Denham Place, the home of Mr.", "Louis Way, F.R.S., but\r\nas that gentleman died in this year, and Edgeworth also refers to events\r\nof a later date as occurring at the same time, it is more probable that\r\nthese visits were paid after the Second Voyage to Mr.", "Benjamin Way, also\r\nF.R.S., and a Director of the South Sea Company.", "In another place\r\nEdgeworth infers that Banks, Solander, and Cook were members of a club\r\nwhich met at Slaughter's Coffee House in 1765.", "Of course, this is an\r\nerror, for Cook was then engaged in Newfoundland, and unknown to the\r\nRoyal Society, whose members composed the club spoken of; in fact, Cook,\r\nthough a frequent guest in after times, was never a member of the Royal\r\nSocieties Club.", "Fanny Burney (Madame d'Arblay) says that in September her father, Dr.", "Charles Burney, spent a few days at Hinchinbroke, Lord Sandwich's place,\r\nin order to meet Cook, Banks, and Solander, and it is evident that the\r\nsecond voyage had been resolved on, for Dr."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_70", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 70)", "language": "it", "content": "Burney's son, James, was\r\nintroduced to Cook by Lord Sandwich, with a view to going on the\r\nexpedition. Shortly after this, Sandwich met Dr. Burney at Lord Oxford's,\r\nHoughton, and asked him if he could recommend any one capable of writing\r\nthe history of the voyage of the Endeavour; he gave Dr. Hawkesworth's\r\nname, and was requested to introduce him to Lord Sandwich on his return\r\nto town. The object of the Second Voyage was, to use Cook's own words:\r\n\r\n\"To put an end to all diversity of opinion about a matter so curious and\r\nimportant, was His Majesty's principal motive in directing this voyage to\r\nbe undertaken, the history of which is now submitted to the public, i.e.,\r\nthe existence of another continent in the South.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the subject had been resumed with renewed vigour after\r\nthe return of the Endeavour, and Dalrymple led one party, who held that\r\nCook had not set the matter at rest as he had left far too much space\r\nuntraversed. WHITBY SHIPS AGAIN. The two ships that were to be employed were probably selected in the\r\nThames by Cook himself, and, like the good ship Endeavour, were built by\r\nFishburn of Whitby, and purchased from Captain W. Hammond of Hull. The\r\nreasoning which guided Cook in his selection is thus laid down by him in\r\nhis introduction to the account of the Second Voyage:\r\n\r\n\"The success of such undertakings as making discoveries in distant parts\r\nof the world, will principally depend on the preparations being well\r\nadapted to what ought to be the first consideration, namely, the\r\npreservation of the adventurers and ships; and this will chiefly depend\r\non the kind, the size, and the properties of the ships chosen for the\r\nservice. These primary considerations will not admit of any other, that\r\nmay interfere with the necessary properties of the ships. Therefore, in\r\nchusing the ships, should any of the most advantageous properties be\r\nwanting, and the necessary room in them be, in any degree, diminished for\r\nless important purposes, such a step would be laying a foundation for\r\nrendering the undertaking abortive in the first instance. The ship must\r\nnot be of great draught, but of sufficient capacity to carry a proper\r\nquantity of provisions and stores for the crew, and of such construction\r\nthat she will bear to take the ground, and of such a size that she can be\r\nconveniently laid on shore if necessary for repairing any damages or\r\ndefects, and these qualities are to be found in North Country built\r\nships, such as are built for the coal trade, and in none other.\"\r\n\r\nThe larger of the two chosen was 462 tons, purchased for 4,151 pounds,\r\nand received into the Royal Navy under the name of the Drake. She was\r\nfitted as a sloop at Deptford, at a cost of 6,568 pounds (this sum,\r\nprobably, covering both the original alterations which proved\r\nunsatisfactory and those made immediately before sailing), and at the\r\ntime of her purchase was about fourteen months old. The second ship was\r\nof 336 tons, also fitted at Deptford as a sloop, was eighteen months old\r\nat time of purchase, cost 2,103 pounds, and was received under the name\r\nof Raleigh. The complement of the Raleigh was eighty, but two additional carpenters'\r\nmates were added to each ship later on. Cook was also instructed not to\r\nbear, as was then usual, any servants on the books, but to enter A.B.s\r\ninstead, and each officer who was entitled to a servant was \"to be paid\r\nan allowance by Bill equal to the wages of the number of servants\r\nrespectively allowed them.\"\r\n\r\nOn 25th December the names of the two ships were changed, the Drake\r\nbecoming the Resolution, and the Raleigh the Adventure. The lieutenants\r\nappointed to the Resolution were Robert Pallisser Cooper, Charles Clerke,\r\nand Richard Pickersgill, and Mr. Tobias Furneaux, Commander, and Joseph\r\nShank first lieutenant, of the Adventure. Of these officers Cook writes:\r\n\r\n\"I had all the reason in the World to be perfectly satisfied with the\r\nchoice of the officers.", "sentences": ["Burney's son, James, was\r\nintroduced to Cook by Lord Sandwich, with a view to going on the\r\nexpedition.", "Shortly after this, Sandwich met Dr.", "Burney at Lord Oxford's,\r\nHoughton, and asked him if he could recommend any one capable of writing\r\nthe history of the voyage of the Endeavour; he gave Dr.", "Hawkesworth's\r\nname, and was requested to introduce him to Lord Sandwich on his return\r\nto town.", "The object of the Second Voyage was, to use Cook's own words:\r\n\r\n\"To put an end to all diversity of opinion about a matter so curious and\r\nimportant, was His Majesty's principal motive in directing this voyage to\r\nbe undertaken, the history of which is now submitted to the public, i.e.,\r\nthe existence of another continent in the South.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the subject had been resumed with renewed vigour after\r\nthe return of the Endeavour, and Dalrymple led one party, who held that\r\nCook had not set the matter at rest as he had left far too much space\r\nuntraversed.", "WHITBY SHIPS AGAIN.", "The two ships that were to be employed were probably selected in the\r\nThames by Cook himself, and, like the good ship Endeavour, were built by\r\nFishburn of Whitby, and purchased from Captain W.", "Hammond of Hull.", "The\r\nreasoning which guided Cook in his selection is thus laid down by him in\r\nhis introduction to the account of the Second Voyage:\r\n\r\n\"The success of such undertakings as making discoveries in distant parts\r\nof the world, will principally depend on the preparations being well\r\nadapted to what ought to be the first consideration, namely, the\r\npreservation of the adventurers and ships; and this will chiefly depend\r\non the kind, the size, and the properties of the ships chosen for the\r\nservice.", "These primary considerations will not admit of any other, that\r\nmay interfere with the necessary properties of the ships.", "Therefore, in\r\nchusing the ships, should any of the most advantageous properties be\r\nwanting, and the necessary room in them be, in any degree, diminished for\r\nless important purposes, such a step would be laying a foundation for\r\nrendering the undertaking abortive in the first instance.", "The ship must\r\nnot be of great draught, but of sufficient capacity to carry a proper\r\nquantity of provisions and stores for the crew, and of such construction\r\nthat she will bear to take the ground, and of such a size that she can be\r\nconveniently laid on shore if necessary for repairing any damages or\r\ndefects, and these qualities are to be found in North Country built\r\nships, such as are built for the coal trade, and in none other.\"\r\n\r\nThe larger of the two chosen was 462 tons, purchased for 4,151 pounds,\r\nand received into the Royal Navy under the name of the Drake.", "She was\r\nfitted as a sloop at Deptford, at a cost of 6,568 pounds (this sum,\r\nprobably, covering both the original alterations which proved\r\nunsatisfactory and those made immediately before sailing), and at the\r\ntime of her purchase was about fourteen months old.", "The second ship was\r\nof 336 tons, also fitted at Deptford as a sloop, was eighteen months old\r\nat time of purchase, cost 2,103 pounds, and was received under the name\r\nof Raleigh.", "The complement of the Raleigh was eighty, but two additional carpenters'\r\nmates were added to each ship later on.", "Cook was also instructed not to\r\nbear, as was then usual, any servants on the books, but to enter A.B.s\r\ninstead, and each officer who was entitled to a servant was \"to be paid\r\nan allowance by Bill equal to the wages of the number of servants\r\nrespectively allowed them.\"\r\n\r\nOn 25th December the names of the two ships were changed, the Drake\r\nbecoming the Resolution, and the Raleigh the Adventure.", "The lieutenants\r\nappointed to the Resolution were Robert Pallisser Cooper, Charles Clerke,\r\nand Richard Pickersgill, and Mr.", "Tobias Furneaux, Commander, and Joseph\r\nShank first lieutenant, of the Adventure.", "Of these officers Cook writes:\r\n\r\n\"I had all the reason in the World to be perfectly satisfied with the\r\nchoice of the officers."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_71", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 71)", "language": "it", "content": "The Second and Third Lieutenants, the Lieutenant\r\nof Marines, two of the Warrant officers, and several of the Petty\r\nofficers had been with me during the former voyage.

Two days after receiving his orders, Cook hoisted his pendant and\r\nsuperintended the alterations that were to be made for the accommodation\r\nof Mr. Banks and his party of scientists. These comprised Dr. Solander,\r\nZoffani, the portrait painter, Dr. Lynd of Edinburgh, to secure whose\r\nservices Parliament had made a special grant of 4000 pounds (though \"what\r\ndiscoveries they expected him to make I could not understand,\" says\r\nCook), and nine others, draughtsmen and servants; at least three more\r\nthan had been thought necessary when the vessel was purchased. These\r\nalterations were:\r\n\r\n\"to raise her upper works about a foot, to lay a spar deck upon her from\r\nthe quarter-deck to the forecastle (she having at this time a low waist),\r\nand to build a round house or coach for my accommodation, so that the\r\ngreat cabin might be appropriated to the use of Mr. Banks alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe Comptroller of the Navy, Captain Pallisser, was strongly opposed to\r\nthese alterations as likely to be detrimental to the ship's sailing\r\nqualities, and though his opinions were overborne, they in the end proved\r\nto be correct. When he had seen the alterations fairly on the way, Cook applied for\r\nthree weeks' leave of absence, on the plea that he had \"some business to\r\ntransact in Yorkshire, as well as to see an aged father,\" and his\r\napplication was at once granted. He therefore went to Ayton, where for\r\nthe first time for seventeen years he was again amongst his own people. From Ayton he went on to Whitby, and was met some miles out from that\r\ntown by many of the leading men of the place. From the Walkers he\r\nreceived the heartiest of welcomes, and it is related that the old\r\nhousekeeper, Mary Prowd, had been carefully instructed that a Commander\r\nin His Majesty's Navy was a very different person from one of her\r\nmaster's apprentices, and must be received with all the marks of respect\r\ndue to his rank. She promised obedience, but, alas, when the time came\r\nher memory fled, and opening wide her arms, she exclaimed: \"O honey\r\nJames! How glad I is to see thee!\" A welcome, probably, more dear to Cook\r\nthan any other could have been, and a proof of the affectionate regard he\r\ncould inspire. In February he was back in London, and Dr. Burney says in his Memoirs:\r\n\r\n\"I had the honour of receiving the illustrious Captain Cook to dine with\r\nme in Queen's Square [Bloomsbury] previously to his second voyage round\r\nthe world. Observing upon a table, Bougainville's Voyage Autour du Monde,\r\nhe turned it over, and made some curious remarks on the illiberal conduct\r\nof that circumnavigator towards himself when they met and crossed each\r\nother; which made me desirous to know, in examining the chart of M. de\r\nBougainville, the several tracks of the two navigators, and exactly where\r\nthey had crossed or approached each other. \"Captain Cook instantly took a pencil from his pocket book and said he\r\nwould trace the route; which he did in so clear and scientific a manner\r\nthat I would not take fifty pounds for my book.

In another passage he again refers to the anxiety of the Navy Board to\r\nsee that the quality of the stores was everything that could be wished,\r\nand the quantity was increased from one to two and a half years' supply. On the 22nd April the two sloops were at Longreach to take in their guns\r\nand gunners' stores; twelve carriage guns and twelve swivel musketoons\r\nfor the Resolution, and ten carriage guns and ten swivels for the\r\nAdventure. These should have been taken on board at Galleon's Reach, but\r\nthe Resolution was drawing too much water--seventeen feet. When here Cook\r\nshowed that he thought she was rather over-weighted with her new upper\r\nworks, and might prove crank, but:\r\n\r\n\"as the Gentlemen's apartments were full of heavy baggage and the sloop a\r\ngood deal lumbered aloft with heavy and some useless articles, which we\r\nmight soon get rid of or get into the hold after we had consumed some of\r\nour provisions, I still entertained hopes that she would bear all her\r\nadditional works, and suspended giving any other opinion until a full\r\ntrial had been made of her, foreseeing what would be the consequence in\r\ncase she did not answer in the manner she was now fitted.\"\r\n\r\nOn 29th April, Mr. Banks gave an entertainment on board to Lord Sandwich,\r\nthe French Ambassador, and other distinguished personages, and Cook notes\r\nthat the first named had been on board several times, \"a laudable tho '\r\nrare thing in a First Lord of the Admiralty.\"\r\n\r\nCook obtained a few days' leave to make his final arrangements, and the\r\nResolution was ordered to the Downs under the first lieutenant, whilst\r\nthe Adventure proceeded to Plymouth; both vessels sailing from Longreach\r\non 10th May. The Resolution, contending against adverse winds, made a\r\nvery slow trip down to the Nore, being four days on the journey, and Mr. Cooper reported to Cook that she was very crank. The latter at once wrote\r\nto the Admiralty that he considered it unsafe to proceed any further with\r\nher in that condition, and proposed that her poop should be cut down, her\r\nmasts shortened, and her guns exchanged to four-pounders. The Navy Board,\r\nhowever, decided that she should be restored to her original state as far\r\nas it was possible to do so; she was therefore ordered to Sheerness, and\r\nher Captain was instructed to join his ship and see the alterations were\r\nproperly carried out. Before leaving London Cook, who had heard it was said that he was not\r\nsatisfied with the vessels chosen for the voyage, wrote to Mr. Stephens\r\non the subject, giving his opinion that the crankness of the Resolution\r\n\"was owing to the additional works that have been built upon her in order\r\nto make large accommodation for the several gentlemen passengers intended\r\nto embark in her.\" He added that the proposed alterations of the Navy\r\nBoard would \"render her as fit to perform the voyage as any ship\r\nwhatever\"; and, referring to the report that he did not approve of the\r\ntype of ship, he says, \"from the knowledge and experience I have had of\r\nthese sort of vessels, I shall always be of opinion that only such are\r\nproper to be sent on Discoveries to very distant parts.\" On the 21st he\r\nagain wrote Stephens that the alterations were making satisfactory\r\nprogress, and that a man had been in the yard who had known the ship\r\nbefore her purchase, and he had \"with some warmth asserted that at that\r\ntime she was not only a stiff ship, but had as many good qualities as any\r\nship ever built in Whitby.\" In reply to a rumour that the men were afraid\r\nto sail in her, he points out that she is moored alongside a wharf, and\r\nthe men could go ashore whenever they pleased, yet he had not lost a\r\nsingle man.

JOHN REINHOLD FORSTER. As soon as it was known that Mr. Banks had withdrawn, Mr. John Reinhold\r\nForster, a German of some scientific reputation, applied for the position\r\nof naturalist for the voyage, and, through the interest of Lord Sandwich,\r\nwas successful. He was to receive the 4000 pounds granted by Parliament\r\nfor Dr. Lynd, and was to pay all expenses, except ship's allowance of\r\nfood, and provide all necessary instruments. He was accompanied by his\r\nson as assistant, a youth of about twenty years, who afterwards attained\r\nsome note by his writings and translations. Messrs. Wales and Bayley were\r\nappointed astronomers by the Board of Longitude, with instructions to\r\ntake and compare observations at every possible opportunity, and to take\r\nunder their special charge the timepieces which were being carried on the\r\ntwo ships for the purpose of testing their accuracy and capabilities in\r\nassisting in ascertaining the longitude. Two of these instruments, made\r\nby Arnold, were placed in Mr. Bayley's charge on the Adventure, and two,\r\none by Arnold, and the other by Kendal on Harrison's principle, under the\r\ncare of Mr. Wales on the Resolution. Great precautions were taken to\r\nprevent any accident or tampering with these instruments; they were kept\r\nin boxes having three locks, the keys were held one by the Captain, one\r\nby the first lieutenant, and the third by the astronomer, so they could\r\nnot even be wound up except in the presence of all three.

CHAPTER 13. 1772 TO 1774. SECOND VOYAGE. Saying goodbye to his family on 21st June, Cook, accompanied by Mr. Wales, left London for Sheerness, and the next day dropped down to the\r\nNore. The Resolution was now drawing only fifteen feet ten inches of\r\nwater instead of seventeen, a very satisfactory improvement. She was\r\ngiven a good trial on a wind, and was found \"to answer exceeding well.\"\r\nOn 3rd July they arrived at Plymouth, having been boarded the day before\r\nby Lord Sandwich and Captain Pallisser, who were on a tour of inspection,\r\nand Cook had the pleasure of giving them a satisfactory account of his\r\nship: \"I had not one fault to allege.\"\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Plymouth, Cook found that orders had been given to the\r\nstores that he was to be supplied with whatever he thought necessary, but\r\nthe only things required were larger coppers for the distilling\r\napparatus, the ones they had on board having proved far too small. The\r\nofficers and crew were paid up to 28th May, and the petty officers and\r\nmen also received two months' advance to enable them to provide\r\nnecessaries and extras for the voyage. Cook remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The payment of six months' wages to the officers, and crews of these two\r\nsloops, being nearly all they had due, was an indulgence never before\r\ngranted to any of His Majesty's Ships.\"\r\n\r\nCook now received his final orders, which he had assisted to draw up--in\r\nfact, \"nothing was inserted that I did not fully comprehend and approve\r\nof.\" He was to call at Madeira for a supply of wine; to sail for the Cape\r\nof Good Hope and there refresh his men; then to look for Cape\r\nCircumcision, placed by M. Bouvet in 54 degrees South, 11 degrees 20\r\nminutes East, to determine if it formed part of a continent, and if so to\r\nexplore it, following the coast and endeavouring to get as near to the\r\nSouth Pole as he could without endangering his ships or crews. Should\r\nCape Circumcision prove to be an island, or should he be unable to find\r\nit, he was to proceed as far south as he thought there was a probability\r\nof meeting with land, and then steering east, circumnavigate the world in\r\nas high a latitude as he could. In case of meeting with land he was to\r\nexplore as far as time would permit. When the season rendered it unsafe\r\nto remain in high latitudes he was to retire to the north to refit and\r\nrecruit, and at a proper season to return to the south. In any unforeseen\r\ncircumstances he was to use his own discretion, and if the Resolution\r\nshould be lost, he was to prosecute his voyage in the Adventure. A copy\r\nof these orders was given to Captain Furneaux, and in case of separation\r\nthe following rendezvous were named: Madeira, Port Praya in the island of\r\nSt. Iago, the Cape of Good Hope, and New Zealand. FORSTER SAVES SHIP! The Forsters evidently were far from pleasant travelling companions, and\r\nat one time or another seem to have quarrelled with every one on board\r\nthe ship. At the very first the father was dissatisfied with the\r\naccommodation allotted to him, and offered Mr. Cooper 100 pounds to turn\r\nout of his cabin; when this offer was declined, he tried to force Mr. Gilbert, the Master, to give up his, threatening if he refused he should\r\nbe reported to the king and turned out of the Navy; this threat appears\r\nto have been a favourite one, and soon became a by-word with the seamen,\r\nwho, according to Mr. Wales, would use it to each other on every possible\r\noccasion. But, according to his own account, Mr. Forster was able to save\r\nthe expedition from a very great disaster on 12th July.", "sentences": ["Joseph Priestley, at that time minister at Mill Hill\r\nChapel, Leeds, had been invited by Mr.", "Banks to accompany him as\r\nastronomer, and his congregation had undertaken to guarantee his position\r\non his return; but the Board of Longitude took objection to his religious\r\nviews, and so his application was withdrawn.", "CHAPTER 13.", "1772 TO 1774.", "SECOND VOYAGE.", "Saying goodbye to his family on 21st June, Cook, accompanied by Mr.", "Wales, left London for Sheerness, and the next day dropped down to the\r\nNore.", "The Resolution was now drawing only fifteen feet ten inches of\r\nwater instead of seventeen, a very satisfactory improvement.", "She was\r\ngiven a good trial on a wind, and was found \"to answer exceeding well.\"\r\nOn 3rd July they arrived at Plymouth, having been boarded the day before\r\nby Lord Sandwich and Captain Pallisser, who were on a tour of inspection,\r\nand Cook had the pleasure of giving them a satisfactory account of his\r\nship: \"I had not one fault to allege.\"\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Plymouth, Cook found that orders had been given to the\r\nstores that he was to be supplied with whatever he thought necessary, but\r\nthe only things required were larger coppers for the distilling\r\napparatus, the ones they had on board having proved far too small.", "The\r\nofficers and crew were paid up to 28th May, and the petty officers and\r\nmen also received two months' advance to enable them to provide\r\nnecessaries and extras for the voyage.", "Cook remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The payment of six months' wages to the officers, and crews of these two\r\nsloops, being nearly all they had due, was an indulgence never before\r\ngranted to any of His Majesty's Ships.\"\r\n\r\nCook now received his final orders, which he had assisted to draw up--in\r\nfact, \"nothing was inserted that I did not fully comprehend and approve\r\nof.\" He was to call at Madeira for a supply of wine; to sail for the Cape\r\nof Good Hope and there refresh his men; then to look for Cape\r\nCircumcision, placed by M.", "Bouvet in 54 degrees South, 11 degrees 20\r\nminutes East, to determine if it formed part of a continent, and if so to\r\nexplore it, following the coast and endeavouring to get as near to the\r\nSouth Pole as he could without endangering his ships or crews.", "Should\r\nCape Circumcision prove to be an island, or should he be unable to find\r\nit, he was to proceed as far south as he thought there was a probability\r\nof meeting with land, and then steering east, circumnavigate the world in\r\nas high a latitude as he could.", "In case of meeting with land he was to\r\nexplore as far as time would permit.", "When the season rendered it unsafe\r\nto remain in high latitudes he was to retire to the north to refit and\r\nrecruit, and at a proper season to return to the south.", "In any unforeseen\r\ncircumstances he was to use his own discretion, and if the Resolution\r\nshould be lost, he was to prosecute his voyage in the Adventure.", "A copy\r\nof these orders was given to Captain Furneaux, and in case of separation\r\nthe following rendezvous were named: Madeira, Port Praya in the island of\r\nSt.", "Iago, the Cape of Good Hope, and New Zealand.", "FORSTER SAVES SHIP!", "The Forsters evidently were far from pleasant travelling companions, and\r\nat one time or another seem to have quarrelled with every one on board\r\nthe ship.", "At the very first the father was dissatisfied with the\r\naccommodation allotted to him, and offered Mr.", "Cooper 100 pounds to turn\r\nout of his cabin; when this offer was declined, he tried to force Mr.", "Gilbert, the Master, to give up his, threatening if he refused he should\r\nbe reported to the king and turned out of the Navy; this threat appears\r\nto have been a favourite one, and soon became a by-word with the seamen,\r\nwho, according to Mr.", "Wales, would use it to each other on every possible\r\noccasion.", "But, according to his own account, Mr.", "Forster was able to save\r\nthe expedition from a very great disaster on 12th July."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_75", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 75)", "language": "it", "content": "He says he came\r\non deck and noticed the ship was adrift from her moorings; neither the\r\nofficer of the watch nor the look-out had seen it till he called\r\nattention, and then, after a scene of the greatest confusion, the ship\r\nwas fortunately brought up within a few feet of the rocks. On the other\r\nhand, the Master's log admits the Resolution got adrift, but before Mr. Forster reached the deck the fact had been reported to the Captain, all\r\nhands turned up, the jib and forestay sail set, and the ship quietly\r\ndropped down into the Sound and anchored, never having been in the\r\nslightest danger. The only other one to notice the affair was Midshipman\r\nWillis, who simply states, \"dropped from the Buoy and anchored in the\r\nSound.\"\r\n\r\nHaving received the private signals of the East India Company's Navy, and\r\nletters of introduction from the Prince of Orange to all the principal\r\nofficers of the Dutch East India Company, instructing them to afford\r\nevery assistance that might be required, Cook hoisted the signal to the\r\nAdventure to weigh anchor at 5 A.M. on 13th July, and with a north-west\r\nbreeze the two ships sailed for Madeira. When well out in the Channel the\r\nResolution's crew was mustered, and it was found that, owing to a mistake\r\nof the clerk, there was one man more than the complement, so John Coghlan\r\nwas entered on the Supernumerary List for Wages and Victuals. On the 23rd they were able to relieve a small French boat, from Ferrol to\r\nCorunna, which had been blown far off her course, and had been short of\r\nwater for a fortnight. The day following they fell in with three Spanish\r\nmen-o'-war; Cook says: \"The sternmost hoisted English colours and fired a\r\ngun to leeward, and soon after hoisted his own proper colours, and spoke\r\nwith the Adventure.\" It appears she enquired who they were, and where\r\nthey were going, and finally wished them a good voyage. This account did\r\nnot satisfy Mr. Forster, who waxes eloquent and describes the event as \"a\r\nscene so humiliating to the masters of the sea.\" He must have formed a\r\nstrange opinion of Cook if he thought for a moment he was one to put up\r\nsilently with anything humiliating to the British flag. Marra, in his\r\nJournal, points out that the build and rig of the ships were unusual for\r\nmen-o'-war, and that when the Spaniards found they had stopped king's\r\nships, they \"made a proper apology, and very politely took leave, wishing\r\nthem a good voyage.\"\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST LOSS. At Madeira, where they arrived on 29th July, they were kindly received by\r\nMr. Loughnan, a merchant of Funchal, who entertained some of the party at\r\nhis house throughout the stay, obtained permission for the Forsters to\r\nexplore the island, and procured for the ships the stores that were\r\nrequired. Here Cook, with his eye on the scurvy, purchased as many onions\r\nas he thought would keep good, and ordered them to be served out\r\nregularly to the crews as long as they lasted. A further stock of fresh\r\nfood in the shape of fowls, pigs, goats, and fruits--chiefly oranges and\r\nbananas--was laid in at Port Praya, where they had called for water. On\r\nthe 19th the first death occurred; one of the carpenter's mates, Henry\r\nSmook, was at work on one of the scuttles and, falling overboard, was\r\nseen under the stern; every effort was made to save him, but it was too\r\nlate. Cook says he was a good, steady man, whose loss was often felt\r\nduring the voyage. On 27th August Cook learnt that the Adventure had also had her losses. Two midshipman, Lambrecht and Kemp, had died of fever, brought on,\r\nCaptain Furneaux believed, by bathing and drinking too much water under\r\nthe hot sun of Port Praya. At this time the Resolution had a clean bill\r\nof health, but for fear lest the heavy rains, to which they were\r\ncontinually subjected, might cause sickness, the ship was constantly\r\nfumigated, washed down, and thoroughly dried by means of stoves, as\r\nadvised by Captains Pallisser and Campbell, with satisfactory results.", "sentences": ["He says he came\r\non deck and noticed the ship was adrift from her moorings;

About the middle of December signs of scurvy began to show,\r\nand extra precautions were at once taken; fresh wort was served out\r\nregularly to all hands and the worst case received considerable benefit\r\nfrom the treatment, although \"Rob of Lemons and Oranges\" (a sort of jelly\r\nmade from the fruits) had had no effect.

When they had got thoroughly clear of all signs of ice, Cook once again\r\nturned south, and by 26th December had worked down as far as 50 degrees\r\n31 minutes South, 26 degrees 57 minutes East, where, though surrounded by\r\nlarge masses of floating ice, they steered to the west, leaving the main\r\nice field to the north of them. Gradually working down to 60 degrees\r\nSouth in the longitude given for Cape Circumcision, and being some\r\nninety-five leagues further south, with no signs of land, Cook concluded\r\nthat M.

The position was fixed as 54 degrees 26.4 minutes South, 3\r\ndegrees 24.2 minutes ??South, and not 54 degrees South, 11 degrees 20\r\nEast, as given to Cook, which will account for his want of success in his\r\nsearch for it.) Here Mr. Wales was enabled to get a sight of the moon for\r\nthe second time since leaving the Cape of Good Hope, and, taking several\r\nobservations, fixed the position of the ship with tolerable accuracy. Changing the course to East-South-East, very foggy weather was\r\nencountered, accompanied by great cold, which coated the rigging with\r\nice, rendering it very pretty to the eye but difficult and unpleasant to\r\nwork. Cook says that, though this suggested very intense cold to the\r\nmind, in reality the thermometer was rather higher than it had been, and\r\nthe sea was far less encumbered with ice. Taking large blocks of ice on\r\nboard it was found that, when the sea water was drained off, they\r\nprovided perfectly fresh water on melting, thus removing a great weight\r\nfrom Cook's shoulders, and he determined on venturing further to the\r\nsouthward. On 17th January 1773 they crossed the Antarctic Circle in\r\nlongitude 39 degrees 35 minutes East, and at noon their latitude, by\r\nobservation, was 66 degrees 36 minutes 30 seconds South, the sea being\r\nfree from ice. However, in the evening they found themselves completely\r\nblocked by an enormous field, extending, as far as the eye could reach,\r\nfrom the south-east round to the west; and as the summer was nearly over,\r\nCook decided it was unwise to attempt anything further southwards, and\r\nordered a retreat to the north. Again making for the land claimed to have\r\nbeen discovered by the French, he spent some days searching for it, but\r\nnothing was seen except some floating weed and a few birds that are\r\nsupposed never to get far away from land.

Cook conjectured, rightly as it\r\nproved, that being a little to the south of Tasman's track, Furneaux\r\nwould make for the rendezvous he had been given at New Zealand, and\r\ntherefore felt himself free to push on to the south-east, as he judged\r\nthat if any large body of land was in the vicinity, it must lie in that\r\ndirection, for the swell coming from the south-west precluded the\r\npossibility of any mass of land being in that quarter.

Of course this pleasant break was followed by a\r\nheavy gale, with a tremendously heavy sea, and the ship ran before it for\r\nNew Zealand.

There was but little edible herbage, but he tried to remedy this\r\nby planting a quantity of European seeds, and he also left, in a place\r\nwhere he hoped they might be undisturbed, a pair of geese. Whilst here\r\nCook was for a time confined to his cabin by what he describes as a\r\nslight cold, but Mr. Forster says was a severe attack of rheumatism. After several unsuccessful attempts, owing to contrary winds, they left\r\nDusky Bay on 11th May, and on the 17th, when near Cape Stephens, fell in\r\nwith six water-spouts, one of which came within fifty yards of the ship,\r\nand Cook regretted he had not fired a gun at it, as he had heard that\r\ncourse recommended. He says he had one ready, but was so busy noting the\r\nphenomena that he did not think of it in time. On the other hand, Forster\r\nsays that one \"was ordered to be got ready, but our people being, as\r\nusual, very desultory about it, the danger was passed before we could try\r\nthe experiment.\"\r\n\r\nFURNEAUX REPORTS. On 18th May they arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound, finding, as Cook had\r\nexpected, the Adventure there before them. Furneaux immediately reported\r\nhimself to his commanding officer, and said they had been there for six\r\nweeks. After they had lost sight of the Resolution on 8th February, they\r\nheard a gun and bore up for it, firing every half-hour, but heard no\r\nreply. They then cruised about for three days as near the spot as the\r\nweather would permit, and then, following Tasman's track, as Cook had\r\nsurmised, made for New Zealand, sighting Van Diemen's Land on 9th March,\r\nnear Tasman's South Cape. He sent a boat ashore at the first opportunity,\r\nand a few traces of natives were seen, but the weather was so threatening\r\nthat the boat had to return to the ship. They then put in to Adventure\r\nBay, and staying five days took in wood and water; they had been reduced\r\nto a quart per day of the last for some time. A few deserted huts and\r\noccasional smokes were seen, but no other signs of the inhabitants. They\r\nthen continued up the coast till it trended away to the west, forming,\r\nFurneaux thought, a deep bay. Passing the islands which now bear\r\nFurneaux's name, bad weather came on, and he judged it wise to make for\r\nhis rendezvous, firmly convinced that Van Diemen's Land was joined to New\r\nHolland. On 30th March they sighted the South Island, and were greatly\r\nretarded in their run up the coast by the heavy swell from the north. On\r\ntheir arrival in Queen Charlotte's Sound, they found the pole erected on\r\nMotuara, with the name of the Endeavour and date on it, and several of\r\nthe inhabitants came forward to trade and enquire after Cook and Tupia. On 11th May they experienced the shock of an earthquake, but no damage\r\nwas done.", "sentences": ["The native was accompanied by two women,\r\nand after an attempt at conversation, presented Cook with a piece of\r\nnative cloth, asking, as far as could be understood, for a boat-cloak in\r\nreturn.", "One was made for him out of red baize, and gave so much\r\nsatisfaction that he presented Cook with his pattou, a sort of short flat\r\nclub made of stone.", "He visited the ship, and took great interest in all\r\nthat was going on, particularly with the saw pit.", "After watching the men\r\nsome time, he intimated his desire to try his hand in the pit, but found\r\nthe work not quite so easy as it looked, and soon required very little\r\npersuasion to relinquish his task.", "Cook speaks very favourably of Dusky Bay, a good anchorage, plenty of\r\ngood water, game, fish, and easy to enter.", "The timber he describes as the\r\nbest he had seen in New Zealand, with the exception of that at the\r\nThames.", "There was but little edible herbage, but he tried to remedy this\r\nby planting a quantity of European seeds, and he also left, in a place\r\nwhere he hoped they might be undisturbed, a pair of geese.", "Whilst here\r\nCook was for a time confined to his cabin by what he describes as a\r\nslight cold, but Mr.", "Forster says was a severe attack of rheumatism.", "After several unsuccessful attempts, owing to contrary winds, they left\r\nDusky Bay on 11th May, and on the 17th, when near Cape Stephens, fell in\r\nwith six water-spouts, one of which came within fifty yards of the ship,\r\nand Cook regretted he had not fired a gun at it, as he had heard that\r\ncourse recommended.", "He says he had one ready, but was so busy noting the\r\nphenomena that he did not think of it in time.", "On the other hand, Forster\r\nsays that one \"was ordered to be got ready, but our people being, as\r\nusual, very desultory about it, the danger was passed before we could try\r\nthe experiment.\"\r\n\r\nFURNEAUX REPORTS.", "On 18th May they arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound, finding, as Cook had\r\nexpected, the Adventure there before them.", "Furneaux immediately reported\r\nhimself to his commanding officer, and said they had been there for six\r\nweeks.", "After they had lost sight of the Resolution on 8th February, they\r\nheard a gun and bore up for it, firing every half-hour, but heard no\r\nreply.", "They then cruised about for three days as near the spot as the\r\nweather would permit, and then, following Tasman's track, as Cook had\r\nsurmised, made for New Zealand, sighting Van Diemen's Land on 9th March,\r\nnear Tasman's South Cape.", "He sent a boat ashore at the first opportunity,\r\nand a few traces of natives were seen, but the weather was so threatening\r\nthat the boat had to return to the ship.", "They then put in to Adventure\r\nBay, and staying five days took in wood and water; they had been reduced\r\nto a quart per day of the last for some time.", "A few deserted huts and\r\noccasional smokes were seen, but no other signs of the inhabitants.", "They\r\nthen continued up the coast till it trended away to the west, forming,\r\nFurneaux thought, a deep bay.", "Passing the islands which now bear\r\nFurneaux's name, bad weather came on, and he judged it wise to make for\r\nhis rendezvous, firmly convinced that Van Diemen's Land was joined to New\r\nHolland.", "On 30th March they sighted the South Island, and were greatly\r\nretarded in their run up the coast by the heavy swell from the north.", "On\r\ntheir arrival in Queen Charlotte's Sound, they found the pole erected on\r\nMotuara, with the name of the Endeavour and date on it, and several of\r\nthe inhabitants came forward to trade and enquire after Cook and Tupia.", "On 11th May they experienced the shock of an earthquake, but no damage\r\nwas done."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_80", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 80)", "language": "it", "content": "Finding that several of the Adventure's crew were very sick, Cook\r\nimmediately sent out boats for a supply of scurvy grass, and:\r\n\r\n\"gave orders that it should be boiled with wheat and portable broth every\r\nmorning for breakfast, and with peas and broth for dinner, knowing from\r\nexperience that these vegetables, thus dressed, are extremely beneficial\r\nin removing all manner of scorbutic complaints.\"\r\n\r\nFurneaux had prepared to winter in Queen Charlotte's Sound, but Cook\r\nthought it too soon to settle down to rest and decided to push on. He was\r\nhalf inclined to go over to Van Diemen's Land and settle the question of\r\nits being a part of New Holland, but Furneaux appeared convinced, and the\r\nwinds were contrary, so he decided on proceeding eastwards, and the\r\nAdventure was ordered to refit as rapidly as possible. A boat sent out\r\nfor timber on 3rd June was chased by a large canoe filled with men, but\r\nCook thought no harm was intended; on a second occasion some natives were\r\non the ship, when a large canoe came up, and those on board requested\r\nCook to fire on it, saying its occupants were enemies. This Cook declined\r\nto do, and, instead, invited them to come on board, an invitation that\r\nwas accepted after a brief ceremonial, and the newcomers behaved\r\nthemselves quite properly; but soon Cook had to get rid of them all, for\r\nhe found his men were selling their clothing, which they would shortly\r\nrequire, for things of no value either as curiosities or otherwise. The\r\nnewcomers went off to Motuara, and Cook followed them up. He had some\r\nlittle conversation with them, but did not remember having seen any of\r\nthem at his previous visit, and thought none of them recognised him. They\r\nhad their cooking utensils with them, and he concluded they intended to\r\nsettle down, at any rate for a time. Gardens had been started by Furneaux on his arrival, and Cook tried to\r\ninterest the Maoris in them; he showed them the potatoes, carrots, and\r\nparsnips, which they seemed to understand and appreciate, and they\r\npromised to look after them. He remarks that the intercourse between the\r\nMaoris and the whites did not tend to improve the morals of the former,\r\nwhom he had hitherto looked upon as superior in that respect to the other\r\nSouth Sea Islanders he had come across. THE WATCH MACHINE. On 7th June the two ships put to sea, and on the 8th some accident\r\nhappened to Arnold's timepiece on board the Resolution, and they were\r\nunable to wind it up. So far it had been working very well, but not quite\r\nso accurately as Kendal's. On the return of the ship to England, Arnold\r\nwas informed that either by carelessness or wilfully Mr. Wales had caused\r\nthis difficulty. Wales attributed this rumour to the Forsters, to whom he\r\nwrote on the subject, and it is very evident from their replies that\r\nthough they did not admit having circulated the report, they were not\r\nignorant that Arnold had been so informed. There does not appear to be\r\nany ground for the accusation, but it does appear very probable it\r\noriginated with the Forsters. Throughout the rest of June they experienced very rough weather, and it\r\nwas not till 18th July that they reached 133 degrees West, having seen no\r\nsigns of land on their way. Cook therefore turned northwards so as to\r\ncross the space between his track north and return south in 1769. This\r\ncourse would practically settle one view about the supposed Southern\r\nContinent, for it had been laid down by some of the theorists that it\r\nmust be in the middle latitudes of the South Pacific. New Zealand had\r\nbeen said to be the western side of this continent (already disproved by\r\nCook in his previous voyage), and what Forster calls \"the pretended\r\ndiscoveries near America,\" the eastern side. The proposed course would\r\ntake the ships through the centre of the part of the ocean in dispute.", "sentences": ["Finding that several of the Adventure's crew were very sick, Cook\r\nimmediately sent out boats for a supply of scurvy grass, and:\r\n\r\n\"gave orders that it should be boiled with wheat and portable broth every\r\nmorning for breakfast, and with peas and broth for dinner, knowing from\r\nexperience that these vegetables, thus dressed, are extremely beneficial\r\nin removing all manner of scorbutic complaints.\"\r\n\r\nFurneaux had prepared to winter in Queen Charlotte's Sound, but Cook\r\nthought it too soon to settle down to rest and decided to push on.", "He was\r\nhalf inclined to go over to Van Diemen's Land and settle the question of\r\nits being a part of New Holland, but Furneaux appeared convinced, and the\r\nwinds were contrary, so he decided on proceeding eastwards, and the\r\nAdventure was ordered to refit as rapidly as possible.", "A boat sent out\r\nfor timber on 3rd June was chased by a large canoe filled with men, but\r\nCook thought no harm was intended; on a second occasion some natives were\r\non the ship, when a large canoe came up, and those on board requested\r\nCook to fire on it, saying its occupants were enemies.", "This Cook declined\r\nto do, and, instead, invited them to come on board, an invitation that\r\nwas accepted after a brief ceremonial, and the newcomers behaved\r\nthemselves quite properly; but soon Cook had to get rid of them all, for\r\nhe found his men were selling their clothing, which they would shortly\r\nrequire, for things of no value either as curiosities or otherwise.", "The\r\nnewcomers went off to Motuara, and Cook followed them up.", "He had some\r\nlittle conversation with them, but did not remember having seen any of\r\nthem at his previous visit, and thought none of them recognised him.", "They\r\nhad their cooking utensils with them, and he concluded they intended to\r\nsettle down, at any rate for a time.", "Gardens had been started by Furneaux on his arrival, and Cook tried to\r\ninterest the Maoris in them; he showed them the potatoes, carrots, and\r\nparsnips, which they seemed to understand and appreciate, and they\r\npromised to look after them.", "He remarks that the intercourse between the\r\nMaoris and the whites did not tend to improve the morals of the former,\r\nwhom he had hitherto looked upon as superior in that respect to the other\r\nSouth Sea Islanders he had come across.", "THE WATCH MACHINE.", "On 7th June the two ships put to sea, and on the 8th some accident\r\nhappened to Arnold's timepiece on board the Resolution, and they were\r\nunable to wind it up.", "So far it had been working very well, but not quite\r\nso accurately as Kendal's.", "On the return of the ship to England, Arnold\r\nwas informed that either by carelessness or wilfully Mr.", "Wales had caused\r\nthis difficulty.", "Wales attributed this rumour to the Forsters, to whom he\r\nwrote on the subject, and it is very evident from their replies that\r\nthough they did not admit having circulated the report, they were not\r\nignorant that Arnold had been so informed.", "There does not appear to be\r\nany ground for the accusation, but it does appear very probable it\r\noriginated with the Forsters.", "Throughout the rest of June they experienced very rough weather, and it\r\nwas not till 18th July that they reached 133 degrees West, having seen no\r\nsigns of land on their way.", "Cook therefore turned northwards so as to\r\ncross the space between his track north and return south in 1769.", "This\r\ncourse would practically settle one view about the supposed Southern\r\nContinent, for it had been laid down by some of the theorists that it\r\nmust be in the middle latitudes of the South Pacific.", "New Zealand had\r\nbeen said to be the western side of this continent (already disproved by\r\nCook in his previous voyage), and what Forster calls \"the pretended\r\ndiscoveries near America,\" the eastern side.", "The proposed course would\r\ntake the ships through the centre of the part of the ocean in dispute."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_81", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 81)", "language": "it", "content": "On 29th July, Cook sent a boat to the Adventure, as he had heard her crew\r\nwere very sickly, and found that about twenty of her men were down with\r\nscurvy, and the cook had died of the disease. Orders were given that the\r\nutmost precautions were to be taken, and wort, carrot marmalade, and rob\r\nof lemon were to be freely served out. On the Resolution, at the same\r\ntime, three men were on the sick list, only one of whom had scurvy, but\r\nsome of the others were showing symptoms, so similar precautions were\r\ntaken, with good results. DANGEROUS WATERS. Cook was so anxious about the Adventure's crew that he would not look for\r\nPitcairn Island, discovered by Carteret, although he believed he was in\r\nits neighbourhood on 1st August (he was about fifteen leagues to the\r\nwest), but a day or so after was able to have Furneaux on board to\r\ndinner, who reported a great improvement. He had some cider on board,\r\nwhich he had served out with gratifying results. Two islands were sighted\r\non the 11th, which Cook named Resolution and Doubtful Islands; he\r\nbelieved them to have been discovered by De Bougainville. The following\r\nmorning at daylight they found themselves almost on the top of what Cook\r\ncalls \"a half drowned island, or rather large coral shoal of about 20\r\nleagues in circuit.\" In the lagoon which it surrounded they saw a large\r\ncanoe under sail. The island was named after Furneaux. As they were now\r\nin such a dangerous neighbourhood, Cook ordered that at night the cutter\r\nwith an officer and seven men should keep in advance of the ships until\r\nthey arrived in sight of Maitea (Osnaburg Island) on 15th July, when,\r\nbeing in waters he knew, its services were discontinued. He steered for\r\nthe south side of Otaheite in order to get fresh vegetables as soon as\r\npossible, and on the 16th at daybreak they found themselves about two\r\nmiles from the reef. The wind dropped, and the set of the current was\r\ntaking them on to the reef, so the boats were ordered out to tow, but\r\ngetting near an opening through which the tide was rushing with great\r\nforce, they were unable to keep the ships off. The anchors were let go,\r\nand the Adventure, finding holding ground, was brought up; but the\r\nResolution was not so fortunate, and was carried on to the reef and\r\nstruck two or three times, fortunately without doing any serious damage. A land breeze springing up and the tide slackening enabled them to get in\r\nsafely, with the loss of three anchors, a cable, and a couple of hawsers;\r\nthe bower anchor was recovered by Mr. Gilbert the next day. Cook says\r\nthat though he thought they had a remarkably narrow escape, the natives\r\nwho saw them did not seem to appreciate that they had been in any danger. They remained at this anchorage for a week, and obtained plenty of\r\ncoconuts and bananas; but though they saw hogs, they were unable to\r\npurchase any, as the people declared they all belonged to their chief;\r\nso, hearing he was in the neighbourhood, Cook landed to call on him, and\r\nat once recognised him as Tearee, whom he had seen in 1769. The chief\r\nalso remembered him, and enquired after several of the Endeavour people. He tried to get Cook to make a longer stay, promising supplies of fresh\r\nmeat as an inducement, but as such promises had so often been broken\r\nbefore, Cook replied he should leave the next day. Whilst here one of the\r\nmarines, who had been ailing more or less all the voyage, and had become\r\ndropsical, died, and the one man who was suffering from scurvy still\r\nremained on the sick list. On the other hand, the Adventure's crew had\r\ngreatly improved in health with the change to fresh vegetables.

Otoo, the king, at once recognised Cook, and enquired after Banks,\r\nSolander, and others of the Endeavour; yet Forster gravely asserts that\r\nhe never saw them at the former visit. The old fort on Point Venus was\r\nreoccupied, tents pitched, and the observatory set up, and the camp was\r\nplaced under the command of Lieutenant Edgecombe of the Marines. SPANIARDS HANGED. The king gave a theatrical entertainment in honour of their arrival, at\r\nwhich his sister was the only female performer. It had some reference to\r\nthe coming of the ships, but they were not able to follow the thread of\r\nthe story. Cook could see that Otoo was nervous and uncomfortable, and\r\nfelt dissatisfied with his reception, so determined to cut short his\r\nstay. No one could understand the reason of the unsatisfactory feeling,\r\nbut Forster suggests that it was owing to the advice of a Spanish\r\ndeserter, who had left his ship about March 1773. This vessel was\r\ncommanded by Don Juan de Langara y Huarto, and was from Callao; her\r\nvoyage has not been published, but the natives gave Forster to understand\r\nthat four of her sailors had been hanged on her arrival. Cook refers to\r\nthe presence of a white man, who, when he thought he had been observed,\r\ndisappeared and was not seen again. Young Forster made an attempt to\r\nexplore the interior, but finding the climbing more difficult than he\r\nexpected, soon returned. In the gardens which had been planted at the\r\nEndeavour's visit, pumpkins seemed to be the only things which had done\r\nwell, and for these the natives did not care, \"which is not to be\r\nwondered at,\" says Cook. Further enquiries as to the religious ceremonies\r\nwere made, but nothing very definite was ascertained; it appeared that on\r\nvery rare occasions special criminals, selected by the high priest, were\r\nsacrificed at the Moris. Cook also formed the opinion that the standard\r\nof morality amongst the women was much higher than had previously been\r\nadmitted. Sailing with a favourable wind on 1st September for Huaheine, the\r\nAdventure ran ashore going through the reef, but with the assistance of\r\nthe Resolution's boats, she was soon towed off without serious damage. Forster, as usual, tries to cause trouble by declaring that Cook would\r\nnot send assistance till the Resolution was safely anchored, and thus\r\nadded to the danger of his consort. As the boats were in the water before\r\nthe accident occurred, in order to render immediate assistance if\r\nrequired, Mr. Forster's story is too thin. On arrival Cook was informed his old friend Oree was coming to see him,\r\nso he went ashore to meet him. The boat was hauled up close to the\r\nchief's house, and then five young plantain trees, as emblems of peace,\r\nwere carried on board one by one, the first three being each accompanied\r\nby a young pig with his ears ornamented with coconut fibre; the fourth\r\nwas accompanied by a dog; and the fifth by the bag which Cook had given\r\nOree in 1769, containing the pewter plate with the inscription relating\r\nto the Endeavour's visit, and the beads, and imitation coins. On the\r\nadvice of his guide, Cook decorated three of the plantains with nails,\r\nmedals, beads, etc., and he, Furneaux, and Forster, landed with them in\r\ntheir hands. They were requested to sit down, and the trees were taken\r\nfrom them and placed before Oree, the first for God, the second for the\r\nking, and the third for Friendship.

Off the southern point of Amsterdam several canoes came out, and their\r\noccupants came aboard without hesitation, presenting cava root as a\r\npeace-offering. The ships anchored in eighteen fathoms, and were soon\r\ncrowded with visitors. Nothing but cloth was offered for sale, so Cook,\r\nfinding the sailors were parting with clothing they would soon be\r\nwanting, issued an order that no curiosities were to be purchased, with\r\nthe result that next morning hogs, fowls, coconuts, and bananas were\r\nforthcoming. Cook, Forster, and some of the others went ashore and found\r\na chief, Attago, who had attached himself to Cook, very useful in their\r\ntrading. Mr. Hodges painted a picture of this landing, but, as Mr. Forster very justly points out, the attire of the natives is far too\r\nclassical. It was noticed that many of the natives had lost the top joint\r\nof the little finger of one, and in some cases, of both hands. This was\r\nunderstood to be a mark of mourning for the loss of parents. The fowls here were remarkably good, and the sailors purchased some for\r\nthe purpose of cock-fighting, but they proved much more successful in the\r\npot. The island is described as well cultivated, not an inch of ground\r\nbeing wasted in roads or fences. Forster reported having seen a large\r\ncasuarina tree loaded with crows, but they proved to be that pest of the\r\nfruit grower--flying foxes. He also states that the Resolution anchored\r\nin the same spot as Tasman when he discovered the island. The natives proved as adept at thieving as the majority of the South Sea\r\nIslanders. One man, who had stolen some books from the Master's cabin,\r\ngot off in his canoe, and being chased, took to the water, and diving\r\nunder his pursuers' boat, unshipped the rudder, and got clear away. Mr. Wales, in going ashore, took off his shoes and stockings to save them\r\nfrom the wet, when they were at once snatched up by a native, who ran off\r\nwith them over the coral rocks, leaving poor Wales in what Cook calls \"an\r\nunpleasant but laughable position,\" unable to follow over the sharp\r\nstone; however, Attago soon afterwards recovered them. The language was closely allied to that used in the Society Group, many\r\nwords being identical; and Cook concluded they had some form of religious\r\nworship, as he noted enclosed pieces of ground in which one or two\r\nparticular men were accustomed to repeat speeches apparently of a set\r\nnature.

Hoping the Adventure\r\nmight yet come in, Cook pushed on with his refit, and thoroughly\r\noverhauled his stores. About 4000 pounds weight of ship's bread was found\r\nunfit for food, and another 3000 pounds nearly as bad; they were very\r\nfortunate, therefore, in getting a plentiful supply of scurvy grass and\r\nwild celery, and a small quantity of vegetables from the gardens they had\r\npreviously laid out. Any doubts that may have been felt about the cannibalism of the New\r\nZealanders was set at rest by some of the officers who surprised a party\r\nengaged in a feast. A human head was purchased from the feasters and\r\ntaken on board, and a piece of the flesh being offered to a Maori, it was\r\ngreedily devoured.

A further attempt to the south was made, and on 30th January the high\r\nlatitude of 71 degrees 10 minutes South was reached, in longitude 106\r\ndegrees 54 minutes West, further progress being stopped by a large and\r\nsolid field of ice. This record was not beaten till 1823, by Weddell, and\r\nuntil recent years very few of the attempts on Antarctic discovery had\r\nproved as successful. Satisfied that there was no continent existing\r\nwithin the Arctic Circle except so far south as to be practically\r\ninaccessible on account of ice, he acknowledged he did not regret he\r\nfound it impossible to go further, and, thinking that in the unexplored\r\nparts of the South Pacific there was room for many large islands, and\r\nalso that discoveries already made had been imperfectly laid down on the\r\ncharts, he decided that it was his duty, as he had a well-found ship and\r\na healthy crew, to remain in these waters and add what he could to the\r\nknowledge of geography. He therefore planned to find the land discovered\r\nby Juan Fernandez in 38 degrees South, and, if unsuccessful, to proceed\r\nto Easter Island and fix its position, as it was very uncertain, then to\r\nproceed to Otaheite, where he had a faint hope he might hear of the\r\nAdventure, and, proceeding further west, settle the position of Tierra\r\nAustral del Espiritu Santo of de Quiros. Afterwards to turn south-east,\r\nand, reaching Cape Horn in November, he would have the best part of the\r\nsummer for exploration in the South Atlantic. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Great as this design appears to be, I however thought it possible to be\r\nexecuted; and when I came to communicate it to the officers, I had the\r\nsatisfaction to find they all heartily concurred in it. I should not do\r\nthese gentlemen justice if I did not take some opportunity to declare\r\nthat they always showed the utmost readiness to carry into execution in\r\nthe most effectual manner, every measure I thought proper to take. Under\r\nsuch circumstances it is hardly necessary to say, that the seamen were\r\nalways obedient and alert; and on this occasion they were so far from\r\nwishing the voyage at an end, that they rejoiced at the prospect of its\r\nbeing prolonged another year and of soon enjoying the benefits of a\r\nmilder climate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Forster does not agree with this account, for he says:\r\n\r\n\"The long continuance in these cold climates began now to hang heavily on\r\nour crew, especially as it banished all hope of returning home this year,\r\nwhich had hitherto supported their spirits.", "sentences": ["Marra says, under 18th December:\r\n\r\n\"Icicles frequently hung to the noses of the men, more than an inch\r\nlong...the men, cased in frozen snow, as if clad in armour, where the\r\nrunning rigging has been so enlarged by frozen sleet as hardly to be\r\ngrasped by the largest hand...yet, under all these hardships, the men\r\ncheerful over their grog, and not a man sick, but of old scars.\"\r\n\r\nCook says that some of the men suffered from fever brought on by the\r\nunavoidable exposure to cold and wet, but it was slight, and \"happily\r\nyielded to the simplest remedies.\" The ship was so surrounded by masses\r\nof ice as to cause some apprehension, but by taking advantage of every\r\nbreath of air the danger was averted.", "Christmas Day was passed in\r\nconstant watchfulness.", "\"We were fortunate in having continual daylight, and clear weather, for\r\nhad it been foggy as on some of the preceding days, nothing less than a\r\nmiracle could have saved us from being dashed to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nOn 7th January 1774, five very successful observations gave the mean\r\nlongitude as 123 degrees 21 minutes West, the watch gave it 123 degrees\r\n44 minutes, and the dead reckoning as 123 degrees 39 minutes.", "Cook\r\nsignifies his keen appreciation of the watch machine, and says: \"I must\r\nhere take notice that our longitude can never be erroneous while we have\r\nso good a guide as Mr.", "Kendal's watch.\"\r\n\r\nOBEDIENT AND ALERT.", "A further attempt to the south was made, and on 30th January the high\r\nlatitude of 71 degrees 10 minutes South was reached, in longitude 106\r\ndegrees 54 minutes West, further progress being stopped by a large and\r\nsolid field of ice.", "This record was not beaten till 1823, by Weddell, and\r\nuntil recent years very few of the attempts on Antarctic discovery had\r\nproved as successful.", "Satisfied that there was no continent existing\r\nwithin the Arctic Circle except so far south as to be practically\r\ninaccessible on account of ice, he acknowledged he did not regret he\r\nfound it impossible to go further, and, thinking that in the unexplored\r\nparts of the South Pacific there was room for many large islands, and\r\nalso that discoveries already made had been imperfectly laid down on the\r\ncharts, he decided that it was his duty, as he had a well-found ship and\r\na healthy crew, to remain in these waters and add what he could to the\r\nknowledge of geography.", "He therefore planned to find the land discovered\r\nby Juan Fernandez in 38 degrees South, and, if unsuccessful, to proceed\r\nto Easter Island and fix its position, as it was very uncertain, then to\r\nproceed to Otaheite, where he had a faint hope he might hear of the\r\nAdventure, and, proceeding further west, settle the position of Tierra\r\nAustral del Espiritu Santo of de Quiros.", "Afterwards to turn south-east,\r\nand, reaching Cape Horn in November, he would have the best part of the\r\nsummer for exploration in the South Atlantic.", "He says:\r\n\r\n\"Great as this design appears to be, I however thought it possible to be\r\nexecuted;

It must be\r\nowned, however, that nothing could be more dejecting than the entire\r\nignorance of our future destination which, without any apparent reason\r\nwas constantly kept a secret to every person in the ship.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Cook and his officers did not think it necessary to\r\nconsult Mr. Forster as to the movements of the ship, or, what is more\r\nprobable, he was in one of his irritable moods and must say something\r\nnasty about someone. The decision to turn northwards was taken none too soon, for on 6th\r\nFebruary a furious storm came on, playing havoc with the sails and\r\nrunning rigging, and though it abated somewhat next morning, it blew very\r\nstrong till the 12th, and would have been highly dangerous if it had\r\ncaught them amongst the ice. On the 17th Cook judged he had crossed his\r\noutward track of 1769, and on the 20th he notes the thermometer rising to\r\n66 degrees, the only real summer day they had experienced since leaving\r\nNew Zealand. Having arrived at the position laid down for the land\r\nsupposed to have been seen by Juan Fernandez, he cruised about but found\r\nno signs, so on the 25th stood away for Easter Island. Cook was now taken seriously ill and was confined to his bed for several\r\ndays by what he calls the bilious cholic, during which time \"Mr. Patten,\r\nthe surgeon, was to me, not only a skilful physician, but an affectionate\r\nnurse.\" He recovered very slowly, and the want of fresh food told against\r\nhim when it came to the question of gathering strength. The only fresh\r\nmeat on board was a dog belonging to Mr. Forster, which was duly\r\nsacrificed and made into soup: \"Thus I received nourishment and strength\r\nfrom food which would have made most people in Europe sick.\" Marra's\r\nJournal says, under 23rd February:\r\n\r\n\"This day the Captain was taken ill, to the grief of all the ship's\r\ncompany.\" 28th February: \"The Captain this day much better, which each\r\nmight read in the countenance of the other, from the highest officer to\r\nthe meanest boy on board the ship.\" 4th March: \"The Captain perfectly\r\nrecovered from his illness, to the great joy of the ship's company.\"\r\n\r\nEASTER ISLAND. At 8 A.M., on 11th March, Easter Island was sighted from the masthead,\r\nand shortly after noon some of the gigantic statues mentioned in\r\nRoggewin's Voyages were clearly distinguished through the glasses. The\r\nposition of the ship at noon had been fixed as 27 degrees 3 minutes\r\nSouth, 109 degrees 46 minutes West. Standing on and off till next\r\nmorning, fair anchorage was found in thirty-six fathoms, but it proved\r\ntoo near the edge of a bank, and they were driven off it in the night. One or two canoes came out to meet them as they were working back, from\r\nwhich plantains were purchased, and Cook proceeded ashore, where he was\r\nimmediately surrounded by natives; indeed, some even swam out to meet\r\nhim. Many of them possessed European hats, jackets, handkerchiefs, etc.,\r\nwhich they were said to have obtained from the Spaniards in 1770. Their\r\nlanguage was very similar to that of Otaheite, and Odidie was able to\r\nunderstand them fairly well. There were no trees exceeding ten feet in\r\nheight, and the land is described as extremely parched and dreary, though\r\na few plantations were seen. Some remarkable pieces of stonework were\r\nnoticed, enclosing small areas of ground, in some of which were the\r\nstatues already mentioned. These were not looked upon by the natives as\r\nobjects of worship, although they did not like the pavements by which\r\nthey were surrounded being walked over, or the statues being closely\r\nexamined. Mr. Forster regarded the enclosures as burial grounds, and the\r\nstatues (portions of some of them are at the British Museum) as monuments\r\nto chiefs.", "sentences": ["At first a painful\r\ndespondence owing to the dreary prospect of another year's cruise to the\r\nsouth seemed painted in every countenance; till by degrees they resigned\r\nthemselves to their fate with a kind of sullen indifference.", "It must be\r\nowned, however, that nothing could be more dejecting than the entire\r\nignorance of our future destination which, without any apparent reason\r\nwas constantly kept a secret to every person in the ship.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Cook and his officers did not think it necessary to\r\nconsult Mr.", "Forster as to the movements of the ship, or, what is more\r\nprobable, he was in one of his irritable moods and must say something\r\nnasty about someone.", "The decision to turn northwards was taken none too soon, for on 6th\r\nFebruary a furious storm came on, playing havoc with the sails and\r\nrunning rigging, and though it abated somewhat next morning, it blew very\r\nstrong till the 12th, and would have been highly dangerous if it had\r\ncaught them amongst the ice.", "On the 17th Cook judged he had crossed his\r\noutward track of 1769, and on the 20th he notes the thermometer rising to\r\n66 degrees, the only real summer day they had experienced since leaving\r\nNew Zealand.", "Having arrived at the position laid down for the land\r\nsupposed to have been seen by Juan Fernandez, he cruised about but found\r\nno signs, so on the 25th stood away for Easter Island.", "Cook was now taken seriously ill and was confined to his bed for several\r\ndays by what he calls the bilious cholic, during which time \"Mr.", "Patten,\r\nthe surgeon, was to me, not only a skilful physician, but an affectionate\r\nnurse.\" He recovered very slowly, and the want of fresh food told against\r\nhim when it came to the question of gathering strength.", "The only fresh\r\nmeat on board was a dog belonging to Mr.", "Forster, which was duly\r\nsacrificed and made into soup: \"Thus I received nourishment and strength\r\nfrom food which would have made most people in Europe sick.\" Marra's\r\nJournal says, under 23rd February:\r\n\r\n\"This day the Captain was taken ill, to the grief of all the ship's\r\ncompany.\" 28th February: \"The Captain this day much better, which each\r\nmight read in the countenance of the other, from the highest officer to\r\nthe meanest boy on board the ship.\" 4th March: \"The Captain perfectly\r\nrecovered from his illness, to the great joy of the ship's company.\"\r\n\r\nEASTER ISLAND.", "At 8 A.M., on 11th March, Easter Island was sighted from the masthead,\r\nand shortly after noon some of the gigantic statues mentioned in\r\nRoggewin's Voyages were clearly distinguished through the glasses.", "The\r\nposition of the ship at noon had been fixed as 27 degrees 3 minutes\r\nSouth, 109 degrees 46 minutes West.", "Standing on and off till next\r\nmorning, fair anchorage was found in thirty-six fathoms, but it proved\r\ntoo near the edge of a bank, and they were driven off it in the night.", "One or two canoes came out to meet them as they were working back, from\r\nwhich plantains were purchased, and Cook proceeded ashore, where he was\r\nimmediately surrounded by natives; indeed, some even swam out to meet\r\nhim.", "Many of them possessed European hats, jackets, handkerchiefs, etc.,\r\nwhich they were said to have obtained from the Spaniards in 1770.", "Their\r\nlanguage was very similar to that of Otaheite, and Odidie was able to\r\nunderstand them fairly well.", "There were no trees exceeding ten feet in\r\nheight, and the land is described as extremely parched and dreary, though\r\na few plantations were seen.", "Some remarkable pieces of stonework were\r\nnoticed, enclosing small areas of ground, in some of which were the\r\nstatues already mentioned.", "These were not looked upon by the natives as\r\nobjects of worship, although they did not like the pavements by which\r\nthey were surrounded being walked over, or the statues being closely\r\nexamined.", "Mr.", "Forster regarded the enclosures as burial grounds, and the\r\nstatues (portions of some of them are at the British Museum) as monuments\r\nto chiefs."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_88", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 88)", "language": "it", "content": "The water supply being found very bad, though Gonzales is said to have\r\nfound good springs, and the fresh food for sale but scanty, the stay was\r\ncut short, and on 16th March sail was made for the Marquesas, discovered\r\nby Mendana in 1595.

The Marquesas were reached on 7th April, and after a narrow escape from\r\nrunning on the rocks, satisfactory anchorage was obtained, and they were\r\nvisited by some of the natives, from whom breadfruit and fish were\r\npurchased. The next day further trading was done, nails being the chief\r\nmedium of exchange, but the natives were inclined to be smart in their\r\ndealings, and on several occasions obtained payment without delivery. Cook here suffered from a relapse, but was able to get about, and after\r\nwarning the officer on watch to keep a smart look-out, or something of\r\nimportance would be stolen, took his seat in a boat to go in search of a\r\nbetter anchorage. He was then informed that a stanchion had been stolen\r\nfrom the gangway, and the thief had got away to his canoe on the other\r\nside of the ship. He ordered a shot to be fired over the canoes, but no\r\none was to be hurt, and he would pull round and secure the thief. The\r\norder was apparently misunderstood, for the thief was killed, and the\r\nrest of the natives hurried ashore. Soon after trading recommenced, and\r\nthe lesson appeared forgotten, for an attempt was made to steal the kedge\r\nanchor by which the ship was being warped nearer the shore. Cook landed,\r\nand the trading went on as if nothing out of the common had occurred, and\r\nsome pigs (so small that it required forty or fifty to provide one meal\r\nfor the crew!) and fruit were purchased; but in the afternoon, when the\r\nboats went in for water, all the natives had disappeared. This Cook\r\nattributed to his not being with them, for the next morning, when he\r\nlanded, trading was resumed. A short trip was made in the boats along the\r\ncoast, and when they returned it was found the market was closed. It\r\nseems one of the young gentlemen had given a small handful of red\r\nfeathers he had obtained at Tonga for a small pig, and now nothing else\r\nwould be accepted, so they sailed for Otaheite on the 11th. Cook was very\r\nmuch annoyed at the ill success in obtaining fresh provisions, for though\r\nnone of the crew were ill, he thought they stood in need of a change of\r\nfood. He describes the inhabitants as the finest race he had seen in the\r\nSouth Seas, almost as fair as Europeans, and their language very similar\r\nto that of Otaheite. Their arms consisted of clubs, spears, and slings,\r\nthe two former very neatly made, and with the latter they threw stones a\r\nconsiderable distance but without accuracy. Mr. Forster managed to secure\r\na quantity of small birds with very beautiful plumage. On the 17th April they sighted the George Islands, discovered by Byron\r\n(native name, Tiookea), but, after sending the Master to report on the\r\nlagoon, Cook decided it was too dangerous to enter, and Mr. Cooper went\r\noff with two boats to see if it were possible to trade. He obtained a few\r\ndogs and coconuts, but the attitude of the natives was so uncertain he\r\nwould not land, and returned to the ship. One of the sailors exchanged a\r\nplantain for a dog, so it was concluded the fruit was unknown.", "sentences": ["The water supply being found very bad, though Gonzales is said to have\r\nfound good springs, and the fresh food for sale but scanty, the stay was\r\ncut short, and on 16th March sail was made for the Marquesas, discovered\r\nby Mendana in 1595.", "The next day, according to Marra, the fresh\r\nprovisions obtained were served out to the crew at the Captain's expense:\r\n\r\n\"namely, two pounds of potatoes a man, and a bunch of bananas to each\r\nmess; and this without reducing their ordinary allowance; an act of\r\ngenerosity which produced its effect; it preserved the crew in health,\r\nand encouraged them to undergo cheerfully the hardships that must\r\nunavoidably happen in the course of so long a voyage.\"\r\n\r\nMARKET SPOILT.", "The Marquesas were reached on 7th April, and after a narrow escape from\r\nrunning on the rocks, satisfactory anchorage was obtained, and they were\r\nvisited by some of the natives, from whom breadfruit and fish were\r\npurchased.", "The next day further trading was done, nails being the chief\r\nmedium of exchange, but the natives were inclined to be smart in their\r\ndealings, and on several occasions obtained payment without delivery.", "Cook here suffered from a relapse, but was able to get about, and after\r\nwarning the officer on watch to keep a smart look-out, or something of\r\nimportance would be stolen, took his seat in a boat to go in search of a\r\nbetter anchorage.", "He was then informed that a stanchion had been stolen\r\nfrom the gangway, and the thief had got away to his canoe on the other\r\nside of the ship.", "He ordered a shot to be fired over the canoes, but no\r\none was to be hurt, and he would pull round and secure the thief.", "The\r\norder was apparently misunderstood, for the thief was killed, and the\r\nrest of the natives hurried ashore.", "Soon after trading recommenced, and\r\nthe lesson appeared forgotten, for an attempt was made to steal the kedge\r\nanchor by which the ship was being warped nearer the shore.", "Cook landed,\r\nand the trading went on as if nothing out of the common had occurred, and\r\nsome pigs (so small that it required forty or fifty to provide one meal\r\nfor the crew!) and fruit were purchased; but in the afternoon, when the\r\nboats went in for water, all the natives had disappeared.", "This Cook\r\nattributed to his not being with them, for the next morning, when he\r\nlanded, trading was resumed.", "A short trip was made in the boats along the\r\ncoast, and when they returned it was found the market was closed.", "It\r\nseems one of the young gentlemen had given a small handful of red\r\nfeathers he had obtained at Tonga for a small pig, and now nothing else\r\nwould be accepted, so they sailed for Otaheite on the 11th.", "Cook was very\r\nmuch annoyed at the ill success in obtaining fresh provisions, for though\r\nnone of the crew were ill, he thought they stood in need of a change of\r\nfood.", "He describes the inhabitants as the finest race he had seen in the\r\nSouth Seas, almost as fair as Europeans, and their language very similar\r\nto that of Otaheite.", "Their arms consisted of clubs, spears, and slings,\r\nthe two former very neatly made, and with the latter they threw stones a\r\nconsiderable distance but without accuracy.", "Mr.", "Forster managed to secure\r\na quantity of small birds with very beautiful plumage.", "On the 17th April they sighted the George Islands, discovered by Byron\r\n(native name, Tiookea), but, after sending the Master to report on the\r\nlagoon, Cook decided it was too dangerous to enter, and Mr.", "Cooper went\r\noff with two boats to see if it were possible to trade.", "He obtained a few\r\ndogs and coconuts, but the attitude of the natives was so uncertain he\r\nwould not land, and returned to the ship.", "One of the sailors exchanged a\r\nplantain for a dog, so it was concluded the fruit was unknown."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_89", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 89)", "language": "it", "content": "On the\r\n19th four more islands were discovered, and named Pallisser Islands, and\r\non rounding one a strong swell rolling in from the south was encountered,\r\n\"a sure sign that we were clear of these low islands.\" On the 21st, land\r\na little to the east of Point Venus was sighted, and next morning they\r\nanchored in Matavai Bay, being immediately visited by the natives, who\r\nseemed greatly pleased to see them again. The old camp was reoccupied,\r\nthe observatory set up for Mr. Wales, and Cook had again the pleasure to\r\nrecord he had no one on the sick list. The king, Otoo, came to visit the camp, bringing as his present a dozen\r\npigs and some fruit, and then with some of his friends went on board ship\r\nto dinner, and to receive the return present. It was then found that the\r\nred feathers were greatly valued, a very fortunate thing as articles of\r\ntrade were running short. Cook, after the disappointment in securing\r\nsupplies at the last visit, intended to make a very short stay, but the\r\nplace now appeared to be very thriving, houses and canoes were being\r\nbuilt in all directions, and there was every sign of prosperity, so he\r\ndecided to remain and refit. On 25th April they had a thunderstorm\r\nlasting three hours, such as no one on board had experienced before. THE OTAHEITAN FLEET. Going to visit Otoo on the next day, Cook was surprised to see a large\r\nnumber of fully-manned canoes ranged along the coast, and a large body of\r\narmed men on the land near them. On landing, he was surrounded by people,\r\nand seized by two chiefs, one of whom wanted to carry him off to see the\r\nking, and the other to see the fleet, and between the two, \"I was like to\r\nbe pulled to pieces,\" the crowd making way with cries of \"Tiya no\r\nTootee.\" He was gradually drawn towards the fleet, but refused to go on\r\nboard, and after a time was allowed to return to his own boats, when he\r\nfound his companions had been subject to similar treatment. They put out\r\nfrom shore in order to have a good look at the fleet, and counted one\r\nhundred and sixty large double canoes, all well equipped and fully\r\nmanned. The chiefs were swathed in vast quantities of cloth, so that to\r\nthe Englishmen it seemed almost a miracle they were able to move. The\r\nvessels were decorated with flags and streamers, and made a very fine\r\nappearance. These were the first line, and, in addition, there were one\r\nhundred and seventy smaller double canoes, each having a small house or\r\ncastle on it, which were thought to be transports and store ships, as the\r\nlarger ones, as far as could be seen, carried no supplies on board. The\r\nnumber of men on board was estimated to be no less than 7,500, and it was\r\nascertained this armada was intended for the subjugation of Eimeo which\r\nhad lately rebelled against Otaheite. Cook was informed Otoo was waiting at the camp for him, but on going\r\nthere he found he had not been there, and on looking for him again in the\r\nafternoon he was still invisible. The fleet had also gone away; and then\r\nit was discovered that some of Cook's clothes had been stolen from the\r\nwash, and the king and Admiral were both in dread of his anger. However,\r\nCook sent word he should take no steps to recover the stolen articles,\r\nand things resumed a friendly aspect, the Admiral, Towha, sending Cook a\r\npresent of two large pigs and some fruit, giving orders to the bearers\r\nthat they were to receive nothing in exchange. He soon after paid a visit\r\nto the ship, and as it was his first, he examined everything with great\r\ncuriosity, and appeared greatly impressed with what he saw. One of the\r\nnatives having been caught making off with a small water cask, Cook\r\ndetermined he should be punished, and made a ceremonial affair of it. The\r\nculprit was first sent on board and put in irons, the natives and the\r\ncrew mustered, and then the thief was taken on shore and triced up.", "sentences": ["On the\r\n19th four more islands were discovered, and named Pallisser Islands, and\r\non rounding one a strong swell rolling in from the south was encountered,\r\n\"a sure sign that we were clear of these low islands.\" On the 21st, land\r\na little to the east of Point Venus was sighted, and next morning they\r\nanchored in Matavai Bay, being immediately visited by the natives, who\r\nseemed greatly pleased to see them again.", "The old camp was reoccupied,\r\nthe observatory set up for Mr.", "Wales, and Cook had again the pleasure to\r\nrecord he had no one on the sick list.", "The king, Otoo, came to visit the camp, bringing as his present a dozen\r\npigs and some fruit, and then with some of his friends went on board ship\r\nto dinner, and to receive the return present.", "It was then found that the\r\nred feathers were greatly valued, a very fortunate thing as articles of\r\ntrade were running short.", "Cook, after the disappointment in securing\r\nsupplies at the last visit, intended to make a very short stay, but the\r\nplace now appeared to be very thriving, houses and canoes were being\r\nbuilt in all directions, and there was every sign of prosperity, so he\r\ndecided to remain and refit.", "On 25th April they had a thunderstorm\r\nlasting three hours, such as no one on board had experienced before.", "THE OTAHEITAN FLEET.", "Going to visit Otoo on the next day, Cook was surprised to see a large\r\nnumber of fully-manned canoes ranged along the coast, and a large body of\r\narmed men on the land near them.", "On landing, he was surrounded by people,\r\nand seized by two chiefs, one of whom wanted to carry him off to see the\r\nking, and the other to see the fleet, and between the two, \"I was like to\r\nbe pulled to pieces,\" the crowd making way with cries of \"Tiya no\r\nTootee.\" He was gradually drawn towards the fleet, but refused to go on\r\nboard, and after a time was allowed to return to his own boats, when he\r\nfound his companions had been subject to similar treatment.", "They put out\r\nfrom shore in order to have a good look at the fleet, and counted one\r\nhundred and sixty large double canoes, all well equipped and fully\r\nmanned.", "The chiefs were swathed in vast quantities of cloth, so that to\r\nthe Englishmen it seemed almost a miracle they were able to move.", "The\r\nvessels were decorated with flags and streamers, and made a very fine\r\nappearance.", "These were the first line, and, in addition, there were one\r\nhundred and seventy smaller double canoes, each having a small house or\r\ncastle on it, which were thought to be transports and store ships, as the\r\nlarger ones, as far as could be seen, carried no supplies on board.", "The\r\nnumber of men on board was estimated to be no less than 7,500, and it was\r\nascertained this armada was intended for the subjugation of Eimeo which\r\nhad lately rebelled against Otaheite.", "Cook was informed Otoo was waiting at the camp for him, but on going\r\nthere he found he had not been there, and on looking for him again in the\r\nafternoon he was still invisible.", "The fleet had also gone away; and then\r\nit was discovered that some of Cook's clothes had been stolen from the\r\nwash, and the king and Admiral were both in dread of his anger.", "However,\r\nCook sent word he should take no steps to recover the stolen articles,\r\nand things resumed a friendly aspect, the Admiral, Towha, sending Cook a\r\npresent of two large pigs and some fruit, giving orders to the bearers\r\nthat they were to receive nothing in exchange.", "He soon after paid a visit\r\nto the ship, and as it was his first, he examined everything with great\r\ncuriosity, and appeared greatly impressed with what he saw.", "One of the\r\nnatives having been caught making off with a small water cask, Cook\r\ndetermined he should be punished, and made a ceremonial affair of it.", "The\r\nculprit was first sent on board and put in irons, the natives and the\r\ncrew mustered, and then the thief was taken on shore and triced up."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_90", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 90)", "language": "it", "content": "Cook\r\nthen made a short speech in which he pointed out that when his men were\r\ncaught stealing from the natives they were always punished, but the\r\nnatives were always stealing from the ship and crew and getting away\r\nunpunished, he therefore ordered the man to be given two dozen lashes. These were duly administered, and Towha made a speech in which he was\r\nunderstood to admit the justice of Cook's action. The marines were then\r\nput through their drill, and fired a few volleys with ball, and the\r\nproceedings terminated; but Cook declares he did not know whether the\r\nnatives were pleased or frightened by the ceremony. The king's brother\r\nthen took some of the officers out to see a part of their fleet at\r\nexercise, and they were just in time to see the conclusion and the\r\nlanding of the men.

In return I gave\r\nhim whatever he desired, which was not a little, and having distributed\r\nred feathers to all the others, conducted them ashore in my boat.\"\r\n\r\nMUSKET STOLEN. On 7th May the king expressed a wish to see Cook, so the latter went\r\nashore, but found his Majesty and many of his leading men had\r\ndisappeared, and the sergeant of marines reported that one of his men had\r\nhad his musket stolen whilst on duty. Cook gave orders that if the musket\r\nwas returned nothing further was to be said, and returned to his ship. Suspicion was attracted to six canoes laden with fruit and baggage, so\r\nCook gave chase in his own boat. One of the canoes then made for the\r\nship, and the occupants, women whom he recognised, informed him they were\r\ntaking some things to the Resolution, and that the king was at Point\r\nVenus. Cook went to the camp, to find this was only a story to put him\r\noff, and he once again gave chase, ordering another boat to follow. A few\r\nshots were fired over the canoes, and five out of the six surrendered,\r\nthe one he had spoken with getting away. He was now told that the gun had\r\nbeen stolen by a native of Tiarabou, and therefore Otoo was unable to get\r\nit back, so after a little discussion he decided to put up with the loss,\r\nand sent word to the king that he would say no more about it. In the\r\nevening, however, the musket and some articles that had not been missed\r\nwere returned, and the men who brought them were duly rewarded. Cook says\r\nit was remarkable how many had been actively engaged in their recovery. One man in particular described most vividly how he had followed up,\r\nattacked and killed the thief of the musket, but at the same time every\r\none was well aware that this hero had never been away from his own house\r\nthroughout the day. A state call was made on Otoo, and with the usual\r\nexchange of presents the old footing was re-established. On the return\r\nfrom this visit a stop was made \"at the dockyards, for such they deserve\r\nto be called,\" and the canoes in construction were inspected, two of them\r\nbeing the largest the Englishmen had yet seen. The king soon after returned the visit, and requested that the big guns\r\nshould be fired, but Cook thinks it was very doubtful if the experience\r\nwas enjoyed. A display of fireworks in the evening was much more to the\r\nnative taste. Referring to the numerous robberies that had been\r\ncommitted, Cook says he found it far the best to deal mildly with the\r\ndelinquents, and the regulations he made were, as a rule, well kept by\r\nthe natives.", "sentences": ["Cook\r\nthen made a short speech in which he pointed out that when his men were\r\ncaught stealing from the natives they were always punished, but the\r\nnatives were always stealing from the ship and crew and getting away\r\nunpunished, he therefore ordered the man to be given two dozen lashes.", "These were duly administered, and Towha made a speech in which he was\r\nunderstood to admit the justice of Cook's action.", "The marines were then\r\nput through their drill, and fired a few volleys with ball, and the\r\nproceedings terminated; but Cook declares he did not know whether the\r\nnatives were pleased or frightened by the ceremony.", "The king's brother\r\nthen took some of the officers out to see a part of their fleet at\r\nexercise, and they were just in time to see the conclusion and the\r\nlanding of the men.", "Cook says the canoes were handled very smartly, and\r\n\"five minutes after putting ashore you could not tell anything of the\r\nkind had been going forward.\"\r\n\r\nThe sea stores were again overhauled, and although the greatest care had\r\nbeen taken with the packing, large quantities of the bread were found to\r\nbe uneatable, rendering the purchase of fresh food at every opportunity\r\nof the greatest importance.", "A state visit was paid on board by Otoo's father and some other members\r\nof the royal family, who presented Cook with:\r\n\r\n\"a complete mourning dress, a curiosity we most valued.", "In return I gave\r\nhim whatever he desired, which was not a little, and having distributed\r\nred feathers to all the others, conducted them ashore in my boat.\"\r\n\r\nMUSKET STOLEN.", "On 7th May the king expressed a wish to see Cook, so the latter went\r\nashore, but found his Majesty and many of his leading men had\r\ndisappeared, and the sergeant of marines reported that one of his men had\r\nhad his musket stolen whilst on duty.", "Cook gave orders that if the musket\r\nwas returned nothing further was to be said, and returned to his ship.", "Suspicion was attracted to six canoes laden with fruit and baggage, so\r\nCook gave chase in his own boat.", "One of the canoes then made for the\r\nship, and the occupants, women whom he recognised, informed him they were\r\ntaking some things to the Resolution, and that the king was at Point\r\nVenus.", "Cook went to the camp, to find this was only a story to put him\r\noff, and he once again gave chase, ordering another boat to follow.", "A few\r\nshots were fired over the canoes, and five out of the six surrendered,\r\nthe one he had spoken with getting away.", "He was now told that the gun had\r\nbeen stolen by a native of Tiarabou, and therefore Otoo was unable to get\r\nit back, so after a little discussion he decided to put up with the loss,\r\nand sent word to the king that he would say no more about it.", "In the\r\nevening, however, the musket and some articles that had not been missed\r\nwere returned, and the men who brought them were duly rewarded.", "Cook says\r\nit was remarkable how many had been actively engaged in their recovery.", "One man in particular described most vividly how he had followed up,\r\nattacked and killed the thief of the musket, but at the same time every\r\none was well aware that this hero had never been away from his own house\r\nthroughout the day.", "A state call was made on Otoo, and with the usual\r\nexchange of presents the old footing was re-established.", "On the return\r\nfrom this visit a stop was made \"at the dockyards, for such they deserve\r\nto be called,\" and the canoes in construction were inspected, two of them\r\nbeing the largest the Englishmen had yet seen.", "The king soon after returned the visit, and requested that the big guns\r\nshould be fired, but Cook thinks it was very doubtful if the experience\r\nwas enjoyed.", "A display of fireworks in the evening was much more to the\r\nnative taste.", "Referring to the numerous robberies that had been\r\ncommitted, Cook says he found it far the best to deal mildly with the\r\ndelinquents, and the regulations he made were, as a rule, well kept by\r\nthe natives."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_91", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 91)", "language": "it", "content": "He was now better pleased with his reception, and concluded\r\nthat the island was in a more prosperous condition than at his last\r\nvisit. When the ship was ready to resume her voyage, several young\r\nnatives volunteered to accompany her, and Mr. Forster was most anxious to\r\ntake one as a servant, but as Cook could see no prospect of returning\r\nthem to their homes, he would not permit one to go. MARRA DESERTS. When the anchor was weighed on 14th May, Marra, the gunner's mate, whose\r\nJournal has been quoted, quietly slipped into the water, and endeavoured\r\nto reach a canoe which was hanging about to pick him up, but he was seen\r\nand taken on board again. In his notes he expresses his regret that the\r\nscientific world thus lost the chance of having the experiences of a\r\nprolonged residence amongst these people placed before it. At the time of\r\nleaving there was great talk of the expedition against Eimeo, and Cook\r\nwould have liked to have watched the proceedings, but he soon saw that\r\nnothing would be done whilst he remained in the vicinity. On their arrival at Huaheine on the 15th the ship was immediately boarded\r\nby Cook's old friend Oree with the usual present, and he and his friends\r\nwere invited to dine on board. He was asked what he would like for the\r\nreturn present, and named axes and nails, which were given him with the\r\nrequest that he would distribute them amongst his people; this he at once\r\ndid, to the apparent satisfaction of all. The thieving propensities of\r\nthe natives were still as bad as ever; a shooting party was robbed of its\r\nstock of trade goods, and the day after three officers were seized and\r\nstripped, so Cook took an armed party ashore, captured two of the leading\r\nchiefs and a large house, and said he should keep them till the things\r\nstolen were returned. This had the desired effect, and everything was\r\nsoon brought back. On 23rd May they sailed for Ulietea, and on their arrival the next day\r\nwere well received, though it was evident provisions were rather scarce. They were informed here that two ships had arrived at Huaheine, one\r\ncommanded by Banks, and the other by Furneaux, and their informant\r\ndescribes both Captains so well that it was some time before Cook\r\nventured to reject the tale as too improbable. It is possible that there\r\nwas some foundation for the story that ships had been seen, for it\r\nafterwards became known that M. St. Dennis had been in the South Pacific\r\nabout this time with two vessels. Notwithstanding pressing invitations from the natives to stay, Cook\r\nsailed for Lord Howe's Island, discovered by Wallis, reaching it on the\r\n6th June, but as it seemed uninhabited it offered no inducement for any\r\nstay. On the 16th a chain of sand-banks and islets surrounding a lagoon\r\ninto which no practicable entrance could be seen, was named Palmerston's\r\nIslands; and on the 20th a landing was effected on Savage Island, but as\r\nthe natives were very threatening, and the country enabled them to\r\napproach closely without exposing themselves, the party retired to the\r\nboats. A few spears were thrown, and Marra says that one would have\r\nstruck Cook had he not seen it coming and stooped in time to avoid it,\r\nand then aimed with his gun loaded with small shot at the thrower, but it\r\nmissed fire; a short time afterwards he again tried it, aiming in the\r\nair, and it was discharged. Forster attributes the constant misfires to\r\nthe bad quality of the flints supplied by the Government, and says that\r\nEnglish flints had a very unsatisfactory reputation on the Continent. MORE THIEVING. The course was now set for Rotterdam, where they arrived on 26th June,\r\nand were fairly well received by the natives, who brought supplies of\r\nfruit before the anchorage had been reached; but they soon began to play\r\nthe old game of trying to annex anything that took their fancy.", "sentences": ["He was now better pleased with his reception, and concluded\r\nthat the island was in a more prosperous condition than at his last\r\nvisit.", "When the ship was ready to resume her voyage, several young\r\nnatives volunteered to accompany her, and Mr.", "Forster was most anxious to\r\ntake one as a servant, but as Cook could see no prospect of returning\r\nthem to their homes, he would not permit one to go.", "MARRA DESERTS.", "When the anchor was weighed on 14th May, Marra, the gunner's mate, whose\r\nJournal has been quoted, quietly slipped into the water, and endeavoured\r\nto reach a canoe which was hanging about to pick him up, but he was seen\r\nand taken on board again.", "In his notes he expresses his regret that the\r\nscientific world thus lost the chance of having the experiences of a\r\nprolonged residence amongst these people placed before it.", "At the time of\r\nleaving there was great talk of the expedition against Eimeo, and Cook\r\nwould have liked to have watched the proceedings, but he soon saw that\r\nnothing would be done whilst he remained in the vicinity.", "On their arrival at Huaheine on the 15th the ship was immediately boarded\r\nby Cook's old friend Oree with the usual present, and he and his friends\r\nwere invited to dine on board.", "He was asked what he would like for the\r\nreturn present, and named axes and nails, which were given him with the\r\nrequest that he would distribute them amongst his people; this he at once\r\ndid, to the apparent satisfaction of all.", "The thieving propensities of\r\nthe natives were still as bad as ever; a shooting party was robbed of its\r\nstock of trade goods, and the day after three officers were seized and\r\nstripped, so Cook took an armed party ashore, captured two of the leading\r\nchiefs and a large house, and said he should keep them till the things\r\nstolen were returned.", "This had the desired effect, and everything was\r\nsoon brought back.", "On 23rd May they sailed for Ulietea, and on their arrival the next day\r\nwere well received, though it was evident provisions were rather scarce.", "They were informed here that two ships had arrived at Huaheine, one\r\ncommanded by Banks, and the other by Furneaux, and their informant\r\ndescribes both Captains so well that it was some time before Cook\r\nventured to reject the tale as too improbable.", "It is possible that there\r\nwas some foundation for the story that ships had been seen, for it\r\nafterwards became known that M.", "St.", "Dennis had been in the South Pacific\r\nabout this time with two vessels.", "Notwithstanding pressing invitations from the natives to stay, Cook\r\nsailed for Lord Howe's Island, discovered by Wallis, reaching it on the\r\n6th June, but as it seemed uninhabited it offered no inducement for any\r\nstay.", "On the 16th a chain of sand-banks and islets surrounding a lagoon\r\ninto which no practicable entrance could be seen, was named Palmerston's\r\nIslands; and on the 20th a landing was effected on Savage Island, but as\r\nthe natives were very threatening, and the country enabled them to\r\napproach closely without exposing themselves, the party retired to the\r\nboats.", "A few spears were thrown, and Marra says that one would have\r\nstruck Cook had he not seen it coming and stooped in time to avoid it,\r\nand then aimed with his gun loaded with small shot at the thrower, but it\r\nmissed fire; a short time afterwards he again tried it, aiming in the\r\nair, and it was discharged.", "Forster attributes the constant misfires to\r\nthe bad quality of the flints supplied by the Government, and says that\r\nEnglish flints had a very unsatisfactory reputation on the Continent.", "MORE THIEVING.", "The course was now set for Rotterdam, where they arrived on 26th June,\r\nand were fairly well received by the natives, who brought supplies of\r\nfruit before the anchorage had been reached; but they soon began to play\r\nthe old game of trying to annex anything that took their fancy."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_92", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 92)", "language": "it", "content": "One\r\nseized the lead which was in use, whilst a second tried to cut the line\r\nwith a stone, and was only persuaded to desist by a charge of small shot\r\nfired at his legs. A small party of sailors went ashore for water, and a\r\nquantity was obtained; but again the natives became too pressing in their\r\nattentions. The doctor's musket was stolen, then Mr. Clerke's, then some\r\nother things and a cooper's adze; and Cook, though at first inclined to\r\ntake no notice, felt compelled to seize two canoes, and himself wounded a\r\nman, who had rendered himself conspicuous by his disorderly conduct, with\r\na charge of small shot, and it was at first rumoured he was killed. This\r\nCook would not believe as he had been very careful not to fire at a vital\r\nspot. After a time the muskets and some of the other things were given\r\nup, so the canoes were returned to their owners, and the adze was\r\ndemanded. Instead of the adze, however, the reported corpse was brought\r\non board, and proved, on examination by the doctor, to be very little the\r\nworse for his experience, having a slight wound on the thigh and a second\r\none on the wrist. He was soon on his feet, and the adze was then\r\nproduced. The next day the people were very civil, and the crew were able\r\nto water without interruption. On 16th July they sighted Aurora Island, discovered by Bougainville, but\r\nit came on to blow hard, so they did not attempt to anchor. The natives\r\ncame down fully armed as if to oppose a landing, and the ship passed on\r\nto Whitsunday Island. Off Malicolo good anchorage was found, and the\r\nnatives came on board, and were so pleased with their reception they\r\nreturned next day in greater numbers, and whilst Cook was in his cabin\r\nwith some who appeared to be chiefs, a great noise arose on deck. A boat\r\nkeeper had declined to allow a native to get into his boat, and the\r\nislander was fitting an arrow to his bow as Cook came on deck, with the\r\nintention of shooting the sailor. Cook shouted at him, and he at once\r\ndiverted his aim to the Captain, but the latter was too quick, and\r\npeppered him with small shot, spoiling his aim. He was not much hurt, and\r\nproceeded to fit another arrow to his bow, when Cook gave him the second\r\nbarrel and induced him to retire. Some of the others also discharged a\r\nfew arrows, so a musket was fired over them, without any effect. A\r\nfour-pound gun was tried, and the effect was truly marvellous; the\r\nnatives in the rigging and on deck threw themselves into the water,\r\nwhilst those in the cabin jumped from the ports, and the ship was left in\r\npeace. Cook was not favourably impressed by these islanders, and\r\ndescribes them as \"in general, the most ugly ill-proportioned people I\r\never saw.\" Forster, however, thought they were very intelligent.

After leaving, many of those on board were very ill for a week or ten\r\ndays from having eaten of a fish which Forster calls a red sea bream, and\r\nCook believed to be the same as those which poisoned de Quiros's people,\r\nand in his account says that:\r\n\r\n\"The fish had eaten of poisonous plants, all parts of the flesh became\r\nempoisoned.

On 1st August a fire broke out on board, and Forster writes:\r\n\r\n\"Confusion and horror appeared in all our faces at the bare mention of\r\nit, and it was some time before proper measures were taken to stop its\r\nprogress, for in these moments of danger few are able to collect their\r\nfaculties and act with cool deliberation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter about half a page of this, on fires in general, he observes:\r\n\r\n\"Providentially the fire of this day was very trifling and extinguished\r\nin a few moments.\"\r\n\r\nThen a few days after a marine, who had fallen overboard, was smartly\r\npicked up, and being well looked after by his comrades, was soon showing\r\nno ill effects of his accident, thus giving Mr. Forster an opportunity to\r\nwrite of it as an example of \"the result of an esprit du corps to which\r\nsailors, at present, are utter strangers.\" An utterly unwarranted sneer. At Erromango, on 4th August, Cook went in with the boats, and the natives\r\ntried to induce them to come on shore, but something roused suspicion\r\nafter he and one man had got into the water, so, making signs that he\r\nwould come back later, he stepped back. The natives then rushed the\r\nboats, trying to drag them onto the beach, and succeeded in stealing two\r\noars, at the same time wounding several of the boats' crews, amongst them\r\nMr. Gilbert, the Master, with a shower of stones, spears, and arrows. Cook attempted to give one of the chiefs a charge of small shot, but his\r\ngun missed fire, and he was obliged, very reluctantly, to order the\r\nmarines to fire, with the result that several of the natives were\r\nwounded. Under the circumstances it was not considered worth while\r\nremaining, so the ship left for Tanna, some twelve leagues to the south. A bright light had been noticed in that direction the night before, which\r\nproved to have been caused by a volcanic eruption. A good anchorage was found at Tanna, and the ship warped close in. Several natives coming on board to trade soon developed the usual\r\npropensity to carry off anything that took their fancy--on this occasion\r\nthe anchor buoys were the special attraction. Muskets were fired over\r\ntheir head to no purpose, so a four-pounder was discharged, which for a\r\ntime had a good result; but soon they were as bad as ever, so two or\r\nthree musquetoons were fired close to them, and though none were hurt,\r\nthe crew were able to get their dinner in peace. HOT SPRINGS. An old man, called by Cook Paowang, appeared to be inclined to be\r\nfriendly, so Cook landed with a strong party to look for water under his\r\nguidance, and met with some of the elders, exchanging presents with them. The next day the ship was warped in, and three boats went ashore, but the\r\nnatives were very threatening, and after some futile attempts to put\r\nthings on a peaceable footing a signal was given to the ship and several\r\nguns were fired, when all the natives ran away except Paowang, who was\r\nsuitably rewarded for his confidence. After a time permission was\r\nobtained to get wood, water, and ballast, and whilst trying to lift a\r\nstone out of a pool below high-water mark, one of the crew scalded his\r\nhand badly. The pool proved to be one of a series of springs running down\r\na spur of the volcano into the sea. Several were tested with the\r\nthermometer, and as much as 202 degrees Fahrenheit was attained. Forster\r\nfound a number of cracks on the ridge from which sulphurous vapour and\r\nsmoke issued, and one of the crew who had been suffering severely from\r\nrheumatism received great temporary benefit from bathing in one of the\r\nsprings.", "sentences": ["He always\r\nstood off and on during the night, and only proceeded through unknown\r\nwaters by day.", "Several of these islets were of a peculiar formation, and\r\none high columnar rock was named the Monument; Forster gives its height\r\nas 140 yards, the other accounts are satisfied with feet.", "Many of the\r\ngroup were inhabited, but no favourable opportunity for landing occurred.", "On 1st August a fire broke out on board, and Forster writes:\r\n\r\n\"Confusion and horror appeared in all our faces at the bare mention of\r\nit, and it was some time before proper measures were taken to stop its\r\nprogress, for in these moments of danger few are able to collect their\r\nfaculties and act with cool deliberation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter about half a page of this, on fires in general, he observes:\r\n\r\n\"Providentially the fire of this day was very trifling and extinguished\r\nin a few moments.\"\r\n\r\nThen a few days after a marine, who had fallen overboard, was smartly\r\npicked up, and being well looked after by his comrades, was soon showing\r\nno ill effects of his accident, thus giving Mr.", "Forster an opportunity to\r\nwrite of it as an example of \"the result of an esprit du corps to which\r\nsailors, at present, are utter strangers.\" An utterly unwarranted sneer.", "At Erromango, on 4th August, Cook went in with the boats, and the natives\r\ntried to induce them to come on shore, but something roused suspicion\r\nafter he and one man had got into the water, so, making signs that he\r\nwould come back later, he stepped back.", "The natives then rushed the\r\nboats, trying to drag them onto the beach, and succeeded in stealing two\r\noars, at the same time wounding several of the boats' crews, amongst them\r\nMr.", "Gilbert, the Master, with a shower of stones, spears, and arrows.", "Cook attempted to give one of the chiefs a charge of small shot, but his\r\ngun missed fire, and he was obliged, very reluctantly, to order the\r\nmarines to fire, with the result that several of the natives were\r\nwounded.", "Under the circumstances it was not considered worth while\r\nremaining, so the ship left for Tanna, some twelve leagues to the south.", "A bright light had been noticed in that direction the night before, which\r\nproved to have been caused by a volcanic eruption.", "A good anchorage was found at Tanna, and the ship warped close in.", "Several natives coming on board to trade soon developed the usual\r\npropensity to carry off anything that took their fancy--on this occasion\r\nthe anchor buoys were the special attraction.", "Muskets were fired over\r\ntheir head to no purpose, so a four-pounder was discharged, which for a\r\ntime had a good result; but soon they were as bad as ever, so two or\r\nthree musquetoons were fired close to them, and though none were hurt,\r\nthe crew were able to get their dinner in peace.", "HOT SPRINGS.", "An old man, called by Cook Paowang, appeared to be inclined to be\r\nfriendly, so Cook landed with a strong party to look for water under his\r\nguidance, and met with some of the elders, exchanging presents with them.", "The next day the ship was warped in, and three boats went ashore, but the\r\nnatives were very threatening, and after some futile attempts to put\r\nthings on a peaceable footing a signal was given to the ship and several\r\nguns were fired, when all the natives ran away except Paowang, who was\r\nsuitably rewarded for his confidence.", "After a time permission was\r\nobtained to get wood, water, and ballast, and whilst trying to lift a\r\nstone out of a pool below high-water mark, one of the crew scalded his\r\nhand badly.", "The pool proved to be one of a series of springs running down\r\na spur of the volcano into the sea.", "Several were tested with the\r\nthermometer, and as much as 202 degrees Fahrenheit was attained.", "Forster\r\nfound a number of cracks on the ridge from which sulphurous vapour and\r\nsmoke issued, and one of the crew who had been suffering severely from\r\nrheumatism received great temporary benefit from bathing in one of the\r\nsprings."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_94", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 94)", "language": "it", "content": "Many good plantations of yams, sugar-cane, and plantains were seen, but\r\nthey could purchase very little as their articles of trade were not\r\nappreciated.

Though no direct signs\r\nof cannibalism had been found, Cook was convinced that the practice was\r\nnot unknown. After leaving Tanna, the western coasts of the different islands were\r\nfollowed up till De Bougainville's Passage was reached, when the course\r\nwas set for Espiritu Santo. In passing Malicolo canoes put off for the\r\nship, but the wind being favourable, Cook would not delay, and gave\r\nForster the opportunity to remark that the main object of the voyage,\r\ni.e. the obtaining a knowledge of the natural history of the islands, was\r\nmade subservient to the production of a new track on the chart of the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere. CARDINAL MORAN'S GEOGRAPHY. On 25th August they entered the bay which Cook believed to be that\r\ndiscovered by De Quiros, and named by him the Bay of St. Philip and St. Iago in the Tierra Austral del Espiritu Santo, now known as the New\r\nHebrides. In this conclusion Cook has the support of Dalrymple and modern\r\ngeographers, but Forster, for some reason which is not quite clear, felt\r\ncompelled to differ. Cardinal Moran, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney,\r\nalso believes Cook to have been mistaken, for in his History of the\r\nCatholic Church in Australia, he places De Quiros's discovery in Port\r\nCurtis, Queensland, where he claims that the first Catholic service ever\r\ncelebrated in Australia was held. He puts aside the fact that the\r\nlatitude of Port Curtis, 24 degrees South, does not agree with that given\r\nby De Quiros, 15 degrees 20 minutes South, by saying that the positions\r\nof newly discovered places were, in those days, \"often purposely\r\nconcealed lest other navigators might appropriate to themselves and their\r\nrespective countries, the results of the discovery.\" He quotes details\r\ngiven in De Quiros's petitions to the King of Spain, and says: \"All these\r\ndetails fit in admirably with Port Curtis on the Queensland coast.\" Now\r\nDe Quiros says the country he discovered was thickly inhabited by a\r\npeople who were armed with bows and arrows, possessed vessels of\r\nearthenware, lived in houses of wood, roofed with palm leaves, were amply\r\nsupplied with oranges, limes, pears, almonds larger than those of Spain,\r\nhogs, fowls, goats, capons, etc. That in the bay where he anchored there\r\nwas no sandy barren ground, no mangroves, no ants, no mosquitoes, and\r\nthat his anchorage lay between two considerable rivers. How these details\r\nfit in with Port Curtis may be evident to his Eminence, but is not\r\napparent to less distinguished mortals. The district of Port Curtis when\r\ndiscovered was very thinly populated, and shows no signs of ever having\r\nbeen otherwise. Bows and arrows and earthenware vessels were absolutely\r\nunknown throughout Australia; houses did not exist, except in the form of\r\ntemporary shelters of branches, leaves, and bark; the fruits and animals\r\nmentioned were unknown; and sandy barren country with mangroves, ants,\r\nand mosquitoes does exist in considerable quantity. The anchorage, had De\r\nQuiros ever been there, might have been between two rivers, the Boyne and\r\nCalliope (both of small size), but Cardinal Moran, to make this detail\r\n\"fit in admirably\", has recourse to the bold measure of moving the mouth\r\nof the Burnett River from Wide Bay to Port Curtis--some 2 1/2 degrees to\r\nthe north of its real position. On the other hand, Cook's description of the New Hebrides fits in with\r\nmuch greater accuracy.

CHAPTER 14. 1774 TO 1775. SECOND VOYAGE CONCLUDED. On 4th September Midshipman Colnett sighted a large island, which was\r\nnamed New Caledonia, the point first seen being called Cape Colnett. An\r\nopening in the surrounding reef having been found by the boats, the\r\nResolution worked up to an anchorage and was quickly surrounded by canoes\r\nwhose occupants were totally unarmed. At first they were shy of coming\r\nnear, but at length one canoe was persuaded to receive some small\r\npresents, and in return gave some fish which \"stunk intolerably,\" but for\r\nall that it was received in hopes more satisfactory trading might result. To some who came on board dinner was offered, but they would touch\r\nnothing but yams. They appeared to know nothing of dogs, goats, or hogs,\r\nbut greatly appreciated both red cloth and nails. Cook landed and was\r\nwell received, and water was pointed out, but it was too inconvenient of\r\naccess; the land near a village was well cultivated and irrigated, the\r\nproducts being chiefly yams, plantains, and coconuts, the latter were not\r\nbearing much fruit. On 6th September Mr. Wales secured a moderately satisfactory observation\r\nof an eclipse of the sun, and was able to fix their position as 20\r\ndegrees 17 minutes 39 seconds South, 164 degrees 41 minutes 21 seconds\r\nEast. On the same day the ship's butcher, Monk, \"a man much esteemed in\r\nthe ship,\" fell down the forehatch, and died the following day from the\r\ninjury received. Whilst some of the crew were engaged in watering, a\r\nsmall party went up the hills to view the surrounding country, but as all\r\nthe natives they met turned back to follow them, Cook remarks, \"at last\r\nour train was numerous.\" They were able to see right across the island,\r\nand estimated the width to be not more than ten leagues. On returning it\r\nwas found the clerk had purchased a fish, something like a sun-fish; and\r\nas the artist was engaged in drawing and describing it, the cook took the\r\nliver and roe for supper in the cabin, with the result that Cook and the\r\nForsters were nearly poisoned, and were only cured by the most careful\r\nattention of the surgeon. When the natives saw the fish the next morning\r\nthey immediately signified it was unfit to eat, but Cook says nothing of\r\nthe kind had been intimated when it was purchased. NORFOLK ISLAND. The natives were described as robust and well made, \"and not in the least\r\naddicted to pilfering, which is more than can be said of any other nation\r\nin this sea.\" The only tame animals they had were large fowls with very\r\nbright plumage. The country was said to consist of rocky hills, and the\r\ntrees identical with those seen in New South Wales. Leaving a sow and\r\nboar behind, in hopes of their being allowed to breed, and marking a tree\r\nwith the name of the ship and the date, they left for the Isle of Pines,\r\nwhere they arrived on the 19th. Here they were in very dangerous waters,\r\nand Cook says the safety of the ship was owing to the splendid way in\r\nwhich the watch was kept, and the brisk manner in which she was handled\r\nby the crew.", "sentences": ["Cooper, who went ashore with the boats, reported that he\r\nlanded near a fine stream of fresh water, \"probably one of those\r\nmentioned by De Quiros;

he put them\r\nvery proudly down as of basaltic formation, and afforded considerable\r\namusement to Cook when he was able to prove they were only trees of the\r\nPine family; in fact, some were afterwards cut down on Botany Island and\r\nused for spars. They were unable to effect a landing on the Isle of Pines\r\nowing to the rocky nature of the shore, but by some unknown means Mr. Hodges painted a view of the interior of the island, published under that\r\ntitle in Cook's Voyages. Norfolk Island was discovered on 10th October,\r\nand a landing was effected, but no sign of inhabitants was seen, though a\r\nwelcome supply of fish, birds, and cabbage palm was obtained. The\r\nvegetation bore a resemblance to that of New Zealand. On 17th October Mount Egmont was sighted, and anchoring in Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound an immediate search was made for a bottle containing\r\nletters which had been left for the Adventure. It was not to be found,\r\nnor was there anything to show by whom it had been taken, but the next\r\nday they saw where an observatory had been set up, and trees cut down\r\nwith axes, and so came to the conclusion their consort had been there. The natives, who were at first very shy, but when they recognised Cook\r\n\"went jumping and skipping about like madmen,\" informed them that the\r\nAdventure came in soon after they had left, and remained two or three\r\nweeks. A story also was told that a ship had been lost on the north side\r\nof the straits shortly before Cook arrived, and some of the people having\r\nhad their clothes stolen by the natives, fired on them, but when their\r\nammunition was exhausted were all killed. This story, evidently a\r\ndistorted account of what happened to some of the Adventure's crew, was\r\ndisbelieved by Cook, who thought there had been some misunderstanding. Cook, from fresh observations, found that he had placed the South Island\r\non his chart some 40 minutes too far to the east, and had made the\r\ndistance between Queen Charlotte's Sound and Cape Pallisser 10 minutes\r\nnearer to each other than they should have been. In this connection he\r\nspeaks in the highest terms of the desire of Mr. Wales to have everything\r\nas accurate as possible. On 11th November the Resolution left the Sound at daybreak to cross the\r\nSouth Pacific between latitudes 54 and 55 degrees, and the course\r\nconvinced Cook there was no possibility of there being any large piece of\r\nland in that portion of the ocean. He therefore stood for the western\r\nentrance of Magellan's Straits, sighting Cape Descada on 17th December,\r\nfollowing the coast round to Christmas Sound, which they reached on the\r\n20th, the country passed being described as \"the most desolate and barren\r\nI ever saw.\" At Christmas Sound they were more fortunate, for wood,\r\nwater, wild celery, and a large number of geese provided them with a\r\nwelcome banquet for Christmas Day. They were visited by some of the\r\nnatives, described as \"a little, ugly, half-starved, beardless race; I\r\nsaw not a tall person amongst them.\" The scent of dirt and train oil they\r\ncarried with them was \"enough to spoil the appetite of any European,\"\r\nconsequently none were invited to join the festivities. They had European\r\nknives, cloth, handkerchiefs, etc., showing they had been in\r\ncommunication with white men; and Forster notes they had canoes which\r\ncould not have been made in the neighbourhood, for there was no timber of\r\nsufficient size. CAPE HORN CORRECTED. Cape Horn was passed on 29th December, and Cook made his longitude 68\r\ndegrees 13 minutes West, a little too far to the westward; it should be\r\n67 degrees 16 minutes West. This is absolutely correct, according to\r\nWharton. On 1st January 1775 they landed on a small island off Staten\r\nIsland, and then put in to a fine sheltered harbour on the main island,\r\nwhich consequently was named New Year Harbour.", "sentences": ["Forster noted \"innumerable columnar forms of a considerable\r\nheight which we distinguished by the help of our glasses\"; he put them\r\nvery proudly down as of basaltic formation, and afforded considerable\r\namusement to Cook when he was able to prove they were only trees of the\r\nPine family; in fact, some were afterwards cut down on Botany Island and\r\nused for spars.", "They were unable to effect a landing on the Isle of Pines\r\nowing to the rocky nature of the shore, but by some unknown means Mr.", "Hodges painted a view of the interior of the island, published under that\r\ntitle in Cook's Voyages.", "Norfolk Island was discovered on 10th October,\r\nand a landing was effected, but no sign of inhabitants was seen, though a\r\nwelcome supply of fish, birds, and cabbage palm was obtained.", "The\r\nvegetation bore a resemblance to that of New Zealand.", "On 17th October Mount Egmont was sighted, and anchoring in Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound an immediate search was made for a bottle containing\r\nletters which had been left for the Adventure.", "It was not to be found,\r\nnor was there anything to show by whom it had been taken, but the next\r\nday they saw where an observatory had been set up, and trees cut down\r\nwith axes, and so came to the conclusion their consort had been there.", "The natives, who were at first very shy, but when they recognised Cook\r\n\"went jumping and skipping about like madmen,\" informed them that the\r\nAdventure came in soon after they had left, and remained two or three\r\nweeks.", "A story also was told that a ship had been lost on the north side\r\nof the straits shortly before Cook arrived, and some of the people having\r\nhad their clothes stolen by the natives, fired on them, but when their\r\nammunition was exhausted were all killed.", "This story, evidently a\r\ndistorted account of what happened to some of the Adventure's crew, was\r\ndisbelieved by Cook, who thought there had been some misunderstanding.", "Cook, from fresh observations, found that he had placed the South Island\r\non his chart some 40 minutes too far to the east, and had made the\r\ndistance between Queen Charlotte's Sound and Cape Pallisser 10 minutes\r\nnearer to each other than they should have been.", "In this connection he\r\nspeaks in the highest terms of the desire of Mr.", "Wales to have everything\r\nas accurate as possible.", "On 11th November the Resolution left the Sound at daybreak to cross the\r\nSouth Pacific between latitudes 54 and 55 degrees, and the course\r\nconvinced Cook there was no possibility of there being any large piece of\r\nland in that portion of the ocean.", "He therefore stood for the western\r\nentrance of Magellan's Straits, sighting Cape Descada on 17th December,\r\nfollowing the coast round to Christmas Sound, which they reached on the\r\n20th, the country passed being described as \"the most desolate and barren\r\nI ever saw.\" At Christmas Sound they were more fortunate, for wood,\r\nwater, wild celery, and a large number of geese provided them with a\r\nwelcome banquet for Christmas Day.", "They were visited by some of the\r\nnatives, described as \"a little, ugly, half-starved, beardless race; I\r\nsaw not a tall person amongst them.\" The scent of dirt and train oil they\r\ncarried with them was \"enough to spoil the appetite of any European,\"\r\nconsequently none were invited to join the festivities.", "They had European\r\nknives, cloth, handkerchiefs, etc., showing they had been in\r\ncommunication with white men; and Forster notes they had canoes which\r\ncould not have been made in the neighbourhood, for there was no timber of\r\nsufficient size.", "CAPE HORN CORRECTED.", "Cape Horn was passed on 29th December, and Cook made his longitude 68\r\ndegrees 13 minutes West, a little too far to the westward; it should be\r\n67 degrees 16 minutes West.", "This is absolutely correct, according to\r\nWharton.", "On 1st January 1775 they landed on a small island off Staten\r\nIsland, and then put in to a fine sheltered harbour on the main island,\r\nwhich consequently was named New Year Harbour."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_97", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 97)", "language": "it", "content": "The weather proved\r\nunfavourable for surveying, but enough was ascertained to convince them\r\nthat the Tierra del Fuego and Staten Island coasts were not so dangerous\r\nto navigation as they had been represented.

Bearing up to\r\nthe north, Georgia Island was seen on the 14th, and was found to be\r\nentirely covered with snow, creating surprise as it was now the height of\r\nsummer. The ship ran in between Georgia and Willis Islands, and\r\npossession was formally taken of the group, though Cook did not think\r\nthat \"any one would ever be benefited by the discovery.\" Working as far\r\nsouth as 60 degrees, he turned to the east, being \"tired of these high\r\nsouthern latitudes where nothing was to be found but ice and thick fogs,\"\r\nand a long hollow swell coming from the westward convinced him that he\r\nwas correct in his assumption that the Gulf of Sebastian and a large body\r\nof land did not exist. On the 30th two large islands were seen, and then\r\nthree rocky islets to the north; the largest was named Freezeland Peak,\r\nafter the sailor who sighted it, S.

The position of the ship was given\r\nas 59 degrees 13 minutes 30 seconds South, 27 degrees 45 minutes West. During the early part of February they ran down east between 58 and 59\r\ndegrees South, frequently having to throw the ship up into the wind to\r\nshake the snow out of her sails, for the weather was very bad. After\r\nanother unsuccessful attempt to find Cape Circumcision, the ship's head\r\nwas turned towards the Cape of Good Hope on 23rd February, and Cook had\r\nthe satisfaction of feeling he had solved the problem of the\r\nnon-existence of any southern continent except in close proximity to the\r\nPole. He firmly believed from his observations of the icefields that such\r\na continent in the far south did exist, but he asserted that further\r\nexploration in that direction would be of little service to navigation,\r\nand would be hardly worth the cost and danger that must be incurred. On 16th March two Dutch ships were seen steering to the west, and a boat\r\nwas sent off to the nearest, which proved to be the Bownkirke Polder,\r\nfrom Bengal. They were offered any supplies the Dutchman had,\r\nnotwithstanding the latter was rather short, owing to his being some time\r\nout from port. Some English sailors on board told of the Adventure having\r\nbeen at the Cape of Good Hope some twelve months previously, and that she\r\nhad reported the massacre of a boat's crew in New Zealand. At the same\r\ntime three more sail came up, one, an English ship, did not intend to\r\ncall at the Cape, so Cook forwarded by her a letter to the Admiralty and\r\nreceived some provisions, and, most valuable gift, a packet of old\r\nnewspapers.

He,\r\nhowever, found time to write two letters to Mr. Walker of Whitby, in the\r\nfirst of which he speaks rather despondingly of being \"confined within\r\nthe limits of Greenwich Hospital, which are far too small for an active\r\nmind like mine\"; and in the second he gives a rapid sketch of the voyage,\r\nwhich, by its clear conciseness, proves the worthlessness of Mr. Forster's sneer, repeated by later writers, that the public account of\r\nthe voyage owed more to the editing of Canon Douglas than to the writing\r\nof Cook. Soon after Cook's arrival in London, Furneaux handed him his Journal of\r\nthe proceedings of the Adventure from the time of their separation off\r\nthe coast of New Zealand. They were blown off the land near Table Cape in\r\nthe beginning of November 1773, again sighting it near Cape Pallisser,\r\nonly to be blown off again, their sails and rigging suffering severely. They put into Tolago Bay for temporary repairs and water, and left again\r\non the 13th, but had to put back till the 16th, and even then the weather\r\nwas so bad that they did not reach Queen Charlotte's Sound till the 30th,\r\nwhen the bottle left by Cook was at once found, telling they were six\r\ndays too late. They pushed on as rapidly as possible with the refit, and\r\nthen were further delayed by finding a large quantity of the bread\r\nrequired rebaking, but they were ready to sail by 17th December. Mr. Rowe\r\nwas sent out with a boat to get a supply of vegetables, and the ship was\r\nto have sailed the following day, but the boat did not return. Burney was\r\nthen sent off with a party of marines in search, and after a time\r\ndiscovered the missing men had been all killed and some of them eaten by\r\nthe Maoris. Portions of the bodies were found and identified--Rowe's\r\nhand, by an old scar, Thomas Hill's hand, had been tattooed in Otaheite;\r\nCaptain Furneaux's servant's hand; and midshipman Woodhouse's shoes were\r\nfound, and a portion of the boat. The natives who had these remains were\r\nfired on, but Burney could take no further steps, for he estimated there\r\nwere fifteen hundred of the natives near the place. Furneaux believed\r\nthat the attack was unpremeditated as the Maoris had been quite friendly,\r\nand both he and Cook had been at the place during their previous visit. He concluded that some sudden quarrel had arisen and the boat's crew had\r\nbeen incautious. MASSACRE. On his next voyage Cook obtained an account of the affair from the\r\nnatives, when they said that the crew was at dinner and some of the\r\nMaoris attempted to steal some bread and fish, whilst one tried to get\r\nsomething from the boat which had been left in charge of the Captain's\r\nblack servant. The thieves were given a thrashing, and a quarrel arose,\r\nduring which two muskets were discharged and two natives were shot. The\r\nMaoris then closed in and killed all the sailors immediately. The\r\nYorkshire Gazette of 4th June 1887 states that it was reported that a\r\nmidshipman escaped the massacre, and after many wanderings reached\r\nEngland in 1777. If this improbable story is true he must have been Mr. Woodhouse, whose shoes were found, for he was the only midshipman in the\r\nboat. On 23rd December the Adventure sailed, but owing to contrary winds did\r\nnot get away from the coast for some days.

Young Forster says that the appointment was first of all given\r\nto his father in a spirit of pique on the part of Lord Sandwich, and then\r\nthe order forbidding him to write was made because the father had refused\r\nto give Miss Ray, Lord Sandwich's mistress, who had admired them when on\r\nboard the ship, some birds brought home from the Cape of Good Hope as a\r\npresent to the Queen.

To give some of his own experiences in the Navy:\r\nOn 4th June 1756, H.M.S. Eagle arrived in Plymouth Sound, after cruising\r\nfor two months in the Channel and off the French coast, and Captain\r\nPallisser reported landing 130 sick, buried at sea 22, and since his\r\narrival in port his surgeon and 4 men had died, and both his surgeon's\r\nmates were very ill; this out of a complement of 400!

Wolfe reported\r\nto Lord George Sackville that some of the regiments employed at Louisburg\r\nhad \"300 or 400 men eat up with scurvy.\" Of the Northumberland when at\r\nHalifax, Lord Colville wrote that frozen (fresh) beef from Boston kept\r\nhis men healthy when in port, \"but the scurvy never fails to pull us down\r\nin great numbers upon our going to sea in spring.\"\r\n\r\nHaving had such experiences Cook appears to have made up his mind to\r\nfight the dreadful scourge from the very first, and though the popular\r\nidea is that he only turned his mind to it during the second voyage, it\r\nis very evident that on the Endeavour he fought it successfully, and it\r\nis most probable would have laid claim to victory had it not been for the\r\nserious losses incurred through the malarial fever and its usual\r\ncompanion, dysentery, contracted at Batavia. In proof of this reference\r\nmay be made to the report of Mr. Perry, surgeon's mate, and, after Mr. Monkhouse's death, surgeon on board. He states they rounded the Horn with\r\nthe crew \"as free from scurvy as on our sailing from Plymouth,\" i.e. after five months. He reports FOR THE WHOLE OF THE VOYAGE, FIVE CASES OF\r\nSCURVY, \"three in Port at New Holland, and two while on the Coast of New\r\nZealand, not a man more suffered any inconvenience from this distemper.\"\r\nHe was one of the five cases, but, at the same time, it must not be\r\nunderstood that no others developed symptoms of scurvy, only they were so\r\nclosely watched and at once subjected to such treatment that the disease\r\nwas not able to gain the upper hand. Cook wrote to the Secretary to the\r\nAdmiralty immediately after his arrival at Batavia, saying, \"I have not\r\nlost one man from sickness.\" He means here, as elsewhere in his Journals,\r\n\"sickness\" to be taken as scurvy, and at that time he had lost only seven\r\nmen: two of Mr. Banks's servants from exposure; three men drowned; Mr. Buchan, a fit, probably apoplectic; and one man, alcoholic poisoning.

During May 1776 Cook sat for his portrait, now in the Painted Hall,\r\nGreenwich, to Sir Nathaniel Dance. There are several portraits of him in\r\nexistence; three by Webber, one being in the National Portrait Gallery;\r\none by Hodges; and one or two others by unknown artists. Mr. Samwell,\r\nsurgeon on the third voyage, says of an engraving by Sherwin, from the\r\nportrait by Dance, that it \"is a most excellent likeness of Captain Cook;\r\nand more to be valued, as it is the only one I have seen that bears any\r\nresemblance to him.\" This portrait of Dance's represents Cook dressed in\r\nhis Captain's uniform, seated at a table on which is a chart. The figure\r\nis evidently that of a tall man--he was over six feet in height--with\r\nbrown unpowdered hair, neatly tied back from the face; the clear\r\ncomplexion shows little effect of exposure to the sea breezes, the\r\npleasant brown eyes look from under rather prominent brows, the nose\r\nrather long, and a good firm mouth. The whole face gives a very pleasant\r\nimpression of the man, and conveys the idea that it was a good likeness. COOK VOLUNTEERS. Omai, a native of Otaheite, was brought to England by Furneaux, was\r\nintroduced to the King, made much of in Society, was painted by Reynolds,\r\nDance, and Hodges, and seems to have conducted himself fairly well. He\r\nwas to be sent back to his own country; and from the orders given to the\r\nResolution, when she returned, it was evident she was to be the ship to\r\ntake him. There was some difficulty as to the man to take command of the\r\nnew expedition, as the Admiralty felt they could not send out Cook again\r\nso soon after his return. However, early in February 1776, he was invited\r\nto dine with Lord Sandwich, to meet Sir Hugh Pallisser and Mr. Stephens,\r\nthe Secretary, when the proposed expedition was discussed and the\r\ndifficulty of finding a commander was brought forward. It is said that\r\nafter some conversation Cook jumped up and declared he would go, and as\r\nthe result of this resolve he called at the Admiralty Office on 10th\r\nFebruary, and made formal application for the command, which was accepted\r\non the same day, and he there and then went to Deptford and hoisted his\r\npendant on the Resolution. Her complement was the same as the previous\r\nvoyage, i.e. 112 men, including 20 marines; and the Quarter Bill,\r\npreserved in the Records Office, shows the stations and duties of each of\r\nthe crew, and the positions of the civilians who in cases of necessity\r\nwere expected to take their places as small arms men. The companion ship, the Discovery, was built by Langborne of Whitby, and\r\nwas purchased for 2,450 pounds from W. Herbert of Scarborough. According\r\nto the Records she was 229 tons burthen, but Cook puts her down as 300\r\ntons; and Burney says the two ships were splendid sailing company, any\r\nadvantage there might be resting with the Discovery. The command was\r\ngiven to Charles Clerke, who had been both the previous voyages.", "sentences": ["On the 30th November 1776 Sir John Pringle, President of the Royal\r\nSociety, in his address to the Fellows, announced that the Copley Gold\r\nMedal had been conferred on Captain Cook for his paper on the Treatment\r\nof Scurvy, and gave some corroborative facts which had come under his own\r\nobservation, concluding his speech as follows:\r\n\r\n\"If Rome decreed the Civic Crown to him who saved the life of a single\r\ncitizen, what wreaths are due to that man, who, having himself saved\r\nmany, perpetuates in your Transactions the means by which Britain may\r\nnow, on the most distant voyages, preserve numbers of her intrepid sons,\r\nher mariners; who, braving every danger, have so liberally contributed to\r\nthe fame, to the opulence, and to the Maritime Empire of this country.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Cook left England on his last voyage he had been informed that the\r\nmedal had been conferred on him, but he never received it, and it was\r\npresented to Mrs.", "Cook, and is now in the British Museum.", "During May 1776 Cook sat for his portrait, now in the Painted Hall,\r\nGreenwich, to Sir Nathaniel Dance.", "There are several portraits of him in\r\nexistence; three by Webber, one being in the National Portrait Gallery;\r\none by Hodges; and one or two others by unknown artists.", "Mr.", "Samwell,\r\nsurgeon on the third voyage, says of an engraving by Sherwin, from the\r\nportrait by Dance, that it \"is a most excellent likeness of Captain Cook;\r\nand more to be valued, as it is the only one I have seen that bears any\r\nresemblance to him.\" This portrait of Dance's represents Cook dressed in\r\nhis Captain's uniform, seated at a table on which is a chart.", "The figure\r\nis evidently that of a tall man--he was over six feet in height--with\r\nbrown unpowdered hair, neatly tied back from the face; the clear\r\ncomplexion shows little effect of exposure to the sea breezes, the\r\npleasant brown eyes look from under rather prominent brows, the nose\r\nrather long, and a good firm mouth.", "The whole face gives a very pleasant\r\nimpression of the man, and conveys the idea that it was a good likeness.", "COOK VOLUNTEERS.", "Omai, a native of Otaheite, was brought to England by Furneaux, was\r\nintroduced to the King, made much of in Society, was painted by Reynolds,\r\nDance, and Hodges, and seems to have conducted himself fairly well.", "He\r\nwas to be sent back to his own country; and from the orders given to the\r\nResolution, when she returned, it was evident she was to be the ship to\r\ntake him.", "There was some difficulty as to the man to take command of the\r\nnew expedition, as the Admiralty felt they could not send out Cook again\r\nso soon after his return.", "However, early in February 1776, he was invited\r\nto dine with Lord Sandwich, to meet Sir Hugh Pallisser and Mr.", "Stephens,\r\nthe Secretary, when the proposed expedition was discussed and the\r\ndifficulty of finding a commander was brought forward.", "It is said that\r\nafter some conversation Cook jumped up and declared he would go, and as\r\nthe result of this resolve he called at the Admiralty Office on 10th\r\nFebruary, and made formal application for the command, which was accepted\r\non the same day, and he there and then went to Deptford and hoisted his\r\npendant on the Resolution.", "Her complement was the same as the previous\r\nvoyage, i.e.", "112 men, including 20 marines; and the Quarter Bill,\r\npreserved in the Records Office, shows the stations and duties of each of\r\nthe crew, and the positions of the civilians who in cases of necessity\r\nwere expected to take their places as small arms men.", "The companion ship, the Discovery, was built by Langborne of Whitby, and\r\nwas purchased for 2,450 pounds from W.", "Herbert of Scarborough.", "According\r\nto the Records she was 229 tons burthen, but Cook puts her down as 300\r\ntons; and Burney says the two ships were splendid sailing company, any\r\nadvantage there might be resting with the Discovery.", "The command was\r\ngiven to Charles Clerke, who had been both the previous voyages."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_106", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 106)", "language": "it", "content": "The Resolution hauled out of dock, 10th March, completed her rigging and\r\ntook in stores and provisions, \"which was as much as we could stow and\r\nthe best of every kind that could be got.\" On the 6th May the pilot went\r\non board to take her down to Longreach for her guns and powder, but owing\r\nto contrary winds she did not reach there till the 30th.

It was\r\nafterwards with Bligh in the Bounty, sold by Adams after the Mutiny to an\r\nAmerican, who sold it again in Chili. It was then purchased for 52 pounds\r\n10 shillings, repaired, and rated, and after keeping fair time for some\r\nyears was presented by Admiral Sir Thomas Herbert to the United Service\r\nMuseum, and is still in working order. CLERKE IN THE FLEET. On 15th June the two ships sailed for the Nore; there the Resolution\r\nwaited for her Captain, whilst the Discovery, under the command of\r\nBurney, went on to Plymouth, but, meeting with damage in a gale, had to\r\nput into Portland for temporary repairs. Captain Clerke was detained in\r\nLondon, \"in the Rules of the Bench,\" as he had become financially\r\nresponsible for a friend who left him in the lurch. He wrote to Banks,\r\nsaying, \"the Jews are exasperated and determined to spare no pains to\r\narrest me.\" It appears that he contracted the illness which led to his\r\ndeath at this period. CHAPTER 16. 1776 TO 1777. THIRD VOYAGE. On 24th June Cook and Omai joined the ship at the Nore, leaving next day\r\nfor Plymouth, arriving there on 30th, three days after the Discovery. On\r\n8th July the final orders, which Cook had helped to draw up, were\r\nreceived. They were to the effect that he was to proceed by the Cape of\r\nGood Hope; to look for some islands said to have been seen by the French\r\nin latitude 48 degrees, about the longitude of Mauritius; to touch at New\r\nZealand, if he thought proper; and then to proceed to Otaheite and leave\r\nOmai there, or at the Society Islands, as the latter might wish. Leaving\r\nOtaheite about February he was to strike the North American coast in\r\nabout 45 degrees latitude, avoiding, if possible, touching at any of the\r\nSpanish dominions, and proceeding northwards to explore any rivers or\r\ninlets that seemed likely to lead to Hudson's or Baffin's Bay. For the\r\nwinter he was to proceed to the Port of St. Peter and St. Paul in\r\nKamtschatka, or other suitable place, and in the ensuing spring he was\r\nagain to try and find a passage either to the east or west; failing that,\r\nthe ships were then to return to England. A reward of 20,000 pounds had\r\nbeen offered to any British merchant ship that discovered a passage\r\nbetween Hudson's Bay and the Pacific; and now this offer was thrown open\r\nto any ship flying the British flag, and the passage might be to the east\r\nor west so long as it was north of latitude 52 degrees.", "sentences": ["The Resolution hauled out of dock, 10th March, completed her rigging and\r\ntook in stores and provisions, \"which was as much as we could stow and\r\nthe best of every kind that could be got.\" On the 6th May the pilot went\r\non board to take her down to Longreach for her guns and powder, but owing\r\nto contrary winds she did not reach there till the 30th.", "On 8th June she\r\nwas visited by Lord Sandwich, Sir Hugh Pallisser, and others from the\r\nAdmiralty, \"to see that everything was compleated to their desire and to\r\nthe satisfaction of all who were to embark in the voyage.\" A bull, two\r\ncows and their calves, with some sheep, were embarked as a present from\r\nKing George to the Otahietans in hopes to start stocking the island.", "A\r\ngood supply of trade was shipped, and extra warm clothing for the crew\r\nwas supplied by the Admiralty:\r\n\r\n\"and nothing was wanting that was thought conducive to either conveniency\r\nor health, such was the extraordinary care taken by those at the head of\r\nthe Naval Departments.\"\r\n\r\nCook and King were to take observations on the Resolution, and Bailey,\r\nwho was with the Adventure the previous voyage, was appointed as\r\nastronomer to the Discovery; the necessary instruments being supplied by\r\nthe Board of Longitude.", "The chronometer, made by Kendal, which had given\r\nsuch satisfaction last voyage, was again on board the Resolution.", "It was\r\nafterwards with Bligh in the Bounty, sold by Adams after the Mutiny to an\r\nAmerican, who sold it again in Chili.", "It was then purchased for 52 pounds\r\n10 shillings, repaired, and rated, and after keeping fair time for some\r\nyears was presented by Admiral Sir Thomas Herbert to the United Service\r\nMuseum, and is still in working order.", "CLERKE IN THE FLEET.", "On 15th June the two ships sailed for the Nore; there the Resolution\r\nwaited for her Captain, whilst the Discovery, under the command of\r\nBurney, went on to Plymouth, but, meeting with damage in a gale, had to\r\nput into Portland for temporary repairs.", "Captain Clerke was detained in\r\nLondon, \"in the Rules of the Bench,\" as he had become financially\r\nresponsible for a friend who left him in the lurch.", "He wrote to Banks,\r\nsaying, \"the Jews are exasperated and determined to spare no pains to\r\narrest me.\" It appears that he contracted the illness which led to his\r\ndeath at this period.", "CHAPTER 16.", "1776 TO 1777.", "THIRD VOYAGE.", "On 24th June Cook and Omai joined the ship at the Nore, leaving next day\r\nfor Plymouth, arriving there on 30th, three days after the Discovery.", "On\r\n8th July the final orders, which Cook had helped to draw up, were\r\nreceived.", "They were to the effect that he was to proceed by the Cape of\r\nGood Hope; to look for some islands said to have been seen by the French\r\nin latitude 48 degrees, about the longitude of Mauritius; to touch at New\r\nZealand, if he thought proper; and then to proceed to Otaheite and leave\r\nOmai there, or at the Society Islands, as the latter might wish.", "Leaving\r\nOtaheite about February he was to strike the North American coast in\r\nabout 45 degrees latitude, avoiding, if possible, touching at any of the\r\nSpanish dominions, and proceeding northwards to explore any rivers or\r\ninlets that seemed likely to lead to Hudson's or Baffin's Bay.", "For the\r\nwinter he was to proceed to the Port of St.", "Peter and St.", "Paul in\r\nKamtschatka, or other suitable place, and in the ensuing spring he was\r\nagain to try and find a passage either to the east or west; failing that,\r\nthe ships were then to return to England.", "A reward of 20,000 pounds had\r\nbeen offered to any British merchant ship that discovered a passage\r\nbetween Hudson's Bay and the Pacific; and now this offer was thrown open\r\nto any ship flying the British flag, and the passage might be to the east\r\nor west so long as it was north of latitude 52 degrees."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_107", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 107)", "language": "it", "content": "On 9th July the marines, who had been carefully selected, embarked under\r\nthe command of Lieutenant Molesworth Phillips, and the following day\r\nofficers and men were paid up to 30th June, and petty officers and seamen\r\nreceived in addition two months' advance.

Letters were sent\r\nto England and one invalid, Cook wishing afterwards that he had sent one\r\nor two more, but he had at the time hopes of their complete recovery. On\r\n31st October they were unable to communicate with the shore owing to a\r\nheavy south-easterly gale which did not blow itself out for three days,\r\nand the Resolution was the only ship in the bay that rode through it\r\nwithout dragging her anchors. On the 10th November the Discovery arrived,\r\nhaving left Plymouth on 1st August. She sighted land above twenty-five\r\nleagues north of Table Bay, but had been blown off the coast in the\r\nstorm. It may be noted here that the French, Spanish, and United States\r\nGovernments issued instructions to their naval officers that Captain Cook\r\nand his ships were to be treated with every respect, and as belonging to\r\na neutral and allied power. An honour to Cook, and also to the nations\r\nwho conferred it on him. When her consort arrived Cook was almost ready for sea, so the refit of\r\nthe Discovery was pushed on as quickly as possible, but some delay arose\r\nin the delivery of bread ordered. Cook says he believes the bakers would\r\nnot put it in hand till they saw the Discovery safely at anchor. However,\r\non 30th November Clerke was handed his instructions, and the two Captains\r\nwent on board their respective ships to find them fully supplied for a\r\nvoyage which was expected to last at least two years.

The Chevalier de Borda had given Cook 48 degrees 26 minutes South, 64\r\ndegrees 57 minutes East of Paris as the position of Rendezvous Island;\r\nthis Cook took to be an isolated rock they only just weathered in the\r\nfog, to which he gave the name of Bligh's Cap, for he said: \"I know\r\nnothing that can Rendezvous at it but fowls of the air, for it is\r\ncertainly inaccessible to every other animal.\" Cook, unaware that\r\nKerguelen had paid two visits to the place, found some difficulty in\r\nrecognising the places described. The country was very desolate, the\r\ncoarse grass hardly worth cutting for the animals; no wood, but a good\r\nsupply of water was obtained; and here the Christmas Day was spent on the\r\n27th, as the 25th and 26th had been full of hard work. A bottle was found\r\nby one of the crew containing a parchment record of the visit of the\r\nFrench in 1772; on the back Cook noted the names of his ships and the\r\nyear of their visit, and adding a silver twopenny piece of 1772, replaced\r\nit in the bottle which was sealed with lead and hidden in a pile of\r\nstones in such a position that it could not escape the notice of any one\r\nvisiting the spot. Running along the coast to the south-east they\r\nencountered very blowy weather, and finding the land even more desolate\r\nthan that at Christmas Harbour, they left on the 31st for New Zealand. Anderson, the surgeon, on whom Cook relied for his notes on Natural\r\nHistory, says:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps no place hitherto discovered in either hemisphere under the same\r\nparallel of latitude affords so scanty a field for the naturalist as this\r\nbarren spot.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole catalogue of plants, including lichens, did not exceed sixteen\r\nor eighteen. A SOUTHERLY BUSTER. The first part of January 1777 was foggy, and Cook says they \"ran above\r\n300 leagues in the dark.\" On the 19th a squall carried away the fore\r\ntopmast and main topgallant mast, and it took the whole day to replace\r\nthe first, but they had nothing suitable for the top gallant mast. On\r\n26th January they put into Adventure Bay, Van Diemen's Land, and obtained\r\na spar; Cook spoke of the timber as being good but too heavy. A few\r\nnatives were seen, but did not create a favourable impression, still Cook\r\nlanded a couple of pigs in hopes to establish the breed, a hope doomed to\r\nbe unsatisfied. The Marquis de Beauvoir relates that in 1866 he saw in\r\nAdventure Bay a tree on which was cut with a knife: Cook, 26th Jan. 1777,\r\nand he was informed it had been cut by the man himself. They seem to have\r\nseen nothing to raise a doubt about Furneaux's conclusion that Van\r\nDiemen's Land formed a part of Australia, so no attempt was made to\r\nsettle the question, and they sailed for New Zealand on the 30th, meeting\r\nwith a \"perfect storm\" from the south; the thermometer rose:\r\n\r\n\"almost in an instant from about 70 degrees to near 90 degrees, but fell\r\nagain when the wind commenced, in fact the change was so rapid that there\r\nwere some on board who did not notice it.\"\r\n\r\nThese storms are of frequent occurrence, and are locally known as\r\nSoutherly Busters. On 10th February Rocks Point, near Cape Farewell, was sighted, and on the\r\n12th they anchored near their old berth in Queen Charlotte's Sound, and a\r\ncamp was immediately established. Here they were visited by a few of the\r\nnatives, some of whom remembered Cook and were recognised by him. At\r\nfirst they thought he had come to avenge the Adventure's losses, but\r\nafter a time were persuaded to put aside their distrust, and they flocked\r\ndown to the shore, every available piece of ground being quickly occupied\r\nby their huts. Cook describes how one party worked.", "sentences": ["Then\r\nsailing south through fog so dense that, Burney says, they were often for\r\nhours together unable to see twice the length of the ship, and, though it\r\nwas the height of summer, the cold was so intense that the warm clothing\r\nhad to be resorted to, they sighted Kerguelen's Land on 24th December.", "The Chevalier de Borda had given Cook 48 degrees 26 minutes South, 64\r\ndegrees 57 minutes East of Paris as the position of Rendezvous Island;\r\nthis Cook took to be an isolated rock they only just weathered in the\r\nfog, to which he gave the name of Bligh's Cap, for he said: \"I know\r\nnothing that can Rendezvous at it but fowls of the air, for it is\r\ncertainly inaccessible to every other animal.\" Cook, unaware that\r\nKerguelen had paid two visits to the place, found some difficulty in\r\nrecognising the places described.", "The country was very desolate, the\r\ncoarse grass hardly worth cutting for the animals; no wood, but a good\r\nsupply of water was obtained; and here the Christmas Day was spent on the\r\n27th, as the 25th and 26th had been full of hard work.", "A bottle was found\r\nby one of the crew containing a parchment record of the visit of the\r\nFrench in 1772; on the back Cook noted the names of his ships and the\r\nyear of their visit, and adding a silver twopenny piece of 1772, replaced\r\nit in the bottle which was sealed with lead and hidden in a pile of\r\nstones in such a position that it could not escape the notice of any one\r\nvisiting the spot.", "Running along the coast to the south-east they\r\nencountered very blowy weather, and finding the land even more desolate\r\nthan that at Christmas Harbour, they left on the 31st for New Zealand.", "Anderson, the surgeon, on whom Cook relied for his notes on Natural\r\nHistory, says:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps no place hitherto discovered in either hemisphere under the same\r\nparallel of latitude affords so scanty a field for the naturalist as this\r\nbarren spot.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole catalogue of plants, including lichens, did not exceed sixteen\r\nor eighteen.", "A SOUTHERLY BUSTER.", "The first part of January 1777 was foggy, and Cook says they \"ran above\r\n300 leagues in the dark.\" On the 19th a squall carried away the fore\r\ntopmast and main topgallant mast, and it took the whole day to replace\r\nthe first, but they had nothing suitable for the top gallant mast.", "On\r\n26th January they put into Adventure Bay, Van Diemen's Land, and obtained\r\na spar; Cook spoke of the timber as being good but too heavy.", "A few\r\nnatives were seen, but did not create a favourable impression, still Cook\r\nlanded a couple of pigs in hopes to establish the breed, a hope doomed to\r\nbe unsatisfied.", "The Marquis de Beauvoir relates that in 1866 he saw in\r\nAdventure Bay a tree on which was cut with a knife: Cook, 26th Jan.", "1777,\r\nand he was informed it had been cut by the man himself.", "They seem to have\r\nseen nothing to raise a doubt about Furneaux's conclusion that Van\r\nDiemen's Land formed a part of Australia, so no attempt was made to\r\nsettle the question, and they sailed for New Zealand on the 30th, meeting\r\nwith a \"perfect storm\" from the south; the thermometer rose:\r\n\r\n\"almost in an instant from about 70 degrees to near 90 degrees, but fell\r\nagain when the wind commenced, in fact the change was so rapid that there\r\nwere some on board who did not notice it.\"\r\n\r\nThese storms are of frequent occurrence, and are locally known as\r\nSoutherly Busters.", "On 10th February Rocks Point, near Cape Farewell, was sighted, and on the\r\n12th they anchored near their old berth in Queen Charlotte's Sound, and a\r\ncamp was immediately established.", "Here they were visited by a few of the\r\nnatives, some of whom remembered Cook and were recognised by him.", "At\r\nfirst they thought he had come to avenge the Adventure's losses, but\r\nafter a time were persuaded to put aside their distrust, and they flocked\r\ndown to the shore, every available piece of ground being quickly occupied\r\nby their huts.", "Cook describes how one party worked."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_109", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 109)", "language": "it", "content": "The ground was\r\nselected, the men tearing up the grass and plants, and erected the huts,\r\nwhilst the women looked after the canoes, properties, and provisions, and\r\ncollected firewood; and he kept the children and some of the oldest of\r\nthe party out of mischief by scrambling the contents of his pockets\r\namongst them. At the same time he noticed that however busy the men might\r\nbe, they took care to be within easy reach of their weapons; and he on\r\nhis side had a strong party of marines on duty, and any party working at\r\na distance from the ship was always armed and under the command of an\r\nofficer experienced in dealing with the natives. Cook was pleased to\r\nnotice his men were not inclined to associate with the Maoris, and he\r\nalways tried to discourage familiarity between his crew and the natives\r\nof the islands he visited. It is worthy of remark that two of the\r\nResolution were on the sick list, whilst the Discovery had a clean bill\r\nof health. One of their constant visitors was a man Cook calls Kahoura, who was\r\npointed out as having been the leader at the massacre of the Adventure's\r\nmen, and it was a matter of surprise to the natives that having him in\r\nhis power Cook did not kill him; but after the fullest possible enquiry\r\nCook believed it was best to let matters rest, as the attack had\r\nevidently arisen out of a sudden quarrel, and was totally unpremeditated. Burney thinks the Maoris felt a certain contempt for the English, either\r\nbecause they were too generous in their dealings, or else because the\r\nmurders were unavenged. The gardens that had been made at the last visit had in some respects\r\nprospered; in particular the potatoes from the Cape had improved in\r\nquality, but as they had been appreciated by the natives, there were few\r\nto be got. Burney, on the other hand, declares that nothing could be\r\nheard of the pigs and fowls that had been left. Omai was anxious to take\r\na New Zealander away with him, and soon found one to volunteer. It was\r\nexplained that he must make up his mind that he would not be able to\r\nreturn, and as he seemed satisfied he and a boy were taken. When they\r\nwere seasick they deeply and loudly lamented leaving their home, but on\r\nrecovery they soon became \"as firmly attached to us as if they had been\r\nborn amongst us.\"\r\n\r\nTHE WEEKLY PAPER. Sailing on 25th February, they crossed the tropic on 27th March, some 9\r\ndegrees further west than Cook wished to have done, and had seen nothing\r\nof importance. It is interesting to note that Burney says each ship\r\npublished a weekly paper, and on signal being made a boat was sent to\r\nexchange when possible. He says Cook was a \"Constant Reader,\" but not a\r\n\"Contributor.\" It is to be regretted that no copies exist of this,\r\nprobably the first oceanic weekly. On 29th March, a small island Cook calls Manganouia was discovered in 21\r\ndegrees 57 minutes South, 201 degrees 53 minutes East (Burney gives 21\r\ndegrees 54 minutes South, 202 degrees 6 minutes East.) but the\r\nlanding-places were too dangerous on account of the surf. A native came\r\non board who was able to converse with Omai, and said they had plenty of\r\nplantains and taro, but neither yams, hogs, nor dogs. He unfortunately\r\nfell over a goat, which he took to be a large bird, and was so frightened\r\nhe had to be put ashore.

it \"far exceeded any present I had ever before\r\nreceived from an Indian Prince.\" The donor was invited on board to\r\nreceive his return present, which proved so satisfactory that on his\r\nreturn to the shore he forwarded still more in addition to his first\r\ngift, and was amused by a drill of the marines and a display of\r\nfireworks, which, though some were spoilt, were the cause of astonishment\r\nand pleasure to the wondering natives. During one of his walks on shore\r\nCook saw a woman just completing a surgical operation on a child's eyes.

On the way the Discovery ran on a shoal,\r\nbut managed to back off without damage. Although he was not short of\r\nwater, Cook went ashore to inspect some well which he had been informed\r\ncontained water of a very superior quality, but he found it very bad, and\r\nsays: \"This will not be the only time I shall have to remark that these\r\npeople do not know what good water is.\" Near these wells was a large\r\nartificial mound about forty feet high, and fifty feet diameter on the\r\ntop, on which large trees were growing. At the foot was a hewn block of\r\ncoral, four feet broad, two and a half feet thick, and fourteen feet\r\nhigh, but the natives present said that there was only one half of it\r\nabove ground. It was supposed to have been erected to the memory of a\r\ngreat chief, but how many years ago it was impossible to guess. KING POLAHO. Whilst anchored here, a large sailing canoe arrived, having on board a\r\nchief who was treated by the natives with the utmost respect, and the\r\nvisitors were given to understand that Tattafee Polaho was the king of\r\nall the islands. He was invited on board, and brought with him as a\r\npresent:\r\n\r\n\"two good fat hogs, though not so fat as himself, for he was the most\r\ncorporate, plump fellow we had met with. I found him to be a sedate,\r\nsensible man; he viewed the ship and the several new objects with\r\nuncommon attention, and asked several pertinent questions.\"\r\n\r\nIn return Cook was invited ashore, and when they were seated, the natives\r\nwho had been trading submitted the articles they had received for\r\nPolaho's inspection, who enquired what each one had sold, and seemed\r\npleased with the bargains made. Everything was returned to its owner,\r\nexcepting a red glass bowl to which the king had taken a great fancy. According to Mr. Basil Thomson, who was for some years in the Pacific\r\nIslands, a red glass bowl was given by the King of Tonga to the notorious\r\nMr. Shirley Baker, as a relic of Captain Cook, but was unfortunately\r\nbroken in New Zealand. It was most probably the one in question. Before\r\nleaving, Polaho presented Cook with one of the red feather caps made from\r\nthe tail feathers of the bird the Sandwich Islanders call Iiwi (Vestiaria\r\ncoicinea), which were evidently considered of extreme value.

Feenough here rejoined the ship, and his behaviour before\r\nPolaho was sufficient evidence as to the high position held by the\r\nlatter, for he made a deep reverence to him, and afterwards would not eat\r\nor drink in his presence, but left the cabin as soon as dinner was\r\nannounced. AN ENTERTAINMENT. On 6th June they sailed for Tongatabu again, accompanied by some sailing\r\ncanoes which could all easily outdistance the two ships. A good anchorage\r\nwas found, and Cook's old friends, Otago and Toobough, were soon on board\r\nto greet them.

Cook speaks very highly of\r\nthe orderly behaviour of the natives, many of whom had never seen a white\r\nman before. Hearing much of an important chief named Mariwaggee, Cook\r\npersuaded the king to escort a party to his residence, which was found to\r\nbe pleasantly situated on an inlet where most of the chiefs resided,\r\nsurrounded by neatly fenced plantations; but they were informed that\r\nMariwaggee had gone to see the ships. This was found to be untrue, but\r\nthe next day he appeared, accompanied by a large number of both sexes,\r\nand Cook at once landed with some presents for him, only to find he was\r\naccompanied by another chief, to whom something had to be given as well. Fortunately the two were easily satisfied, and the present was divided\r\nbetween them. Mariwaggee was found to be the father of Feenough, and the\r\nfather-in-law of the king. He gave a grand entertainment of singing and\r\ndancing in honour of the strangers, which commenced about eleven in the\r\nmorning and lasted till between three and four in the afternoon, and\r\nwound up with a presentation of a large number of yams, each pair of the\r\nroots being tied to a stick about six feet long, and decorated with fish. Cook says it was hard to say which was the most valuable, the yams for\r\nfood or the sticks for firewood; but, as for the fish, \"it might serve to\r\nplease the sight, but was very offensive to the smell, as some of it had\r\nbeen kept two or three days for this occasion.\" More singing and dancing\r\nthen took place, and then the English gave a display of fireworks, which\r\n\"astonished and highly entertained\" the natives. Being afraid that some of his live stock might be stolen, Cook tried to\r\ninterest some of the chiefs in them by presenting the king with a bull\r\nand cow and some goats; to Feenough a horse and mare, and to Mariwaggee a\r\nram and two ewes. Some one, however, was not satisfied, and a kid and two\r\nturkey cocks were stolen; and as thefts had been frequent and very\r\ndaring, including an attempt to steal one of the anchors of the\r\nDiscovery, which would have been successful had not one of the flukes of\r\nthe anchor got fixed in one of the chain plates, Cook determined to put\r\nhis foot down.

Each set consisted of four placed in a square about two feet\r\napart, secured from spreading by cross pieces, and carried up to a height\r\nof about thirty feet, the intervening space being filled with yams.

Cook was particularly\r\nstruck by the way the men raised these two towers, and says if he had\r\nordered his sailors to do such a thing, they would have wanted carpenters\r\nand tools and at least a hundredweight of nails, and would have taken as\r\nmany days as it did these people hours. When the erections were\r\ncompleted, piles of bread-fruit and yams were heaped on either side, and\r\na turtle and some excellent fish were added, and then the whole was\r\npresented to Cook. A party of officers from both ships went off to an island without leave,\r\nand returned two days after without their muskets, ammunition, and other\r\narticles which had been stolen. They persuaded Omai to make a private\r\ncomplaint to the king, which resulted in the chiefs leaving the\r\nneighbourhood. Their disappearance annoyed Cook, and when the affair was\r\nexplained to him he severely reprimanded Omai for speaking on the matter\r\nwithout orders. This put Omai on his mettle, and he managed to persuade\r\nFeenough to return, and informed the king that no serious consequences\r\nshould ensue. Matters were then easily smoothed over; most of the stolen\r\ngoods, including the missing turkey, were returned, and the king said he\r\nought not to have been held responsible, for, if he had known that any\r\none wished to see the island, he would have sent a chief who would have\r\nensured their safety. An eclipse of the sun was to occur on 5th July, and Cook decided to\r\nremain so as to secure observations, and meanwhile employed himself in\r\nexploring the neighbourhood and studying the customs of the natives. On\r\none occasion, thinking to see an interesting ceremony, he accompanied\r\nPolaho, who was going to do state mourning for a son who had been dead\r\nsome time. The result was disappointing, and the chief impression left\r\nwith Cook seems to have been that over their clothing of native cloth,\r\nthose present wore old and ragged mats; those of the king being the\r\nraggedest, and \"might have served his great-grandfather on some such like\r\noccasion.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 5th proved dark and cloudy, with heavy showers of rain, and the\r\nobservations were unsatisfactory, especially as the clouds came up\r\nthickly in the middle of the eclipse, and the sun was seen no more for\r\nthe rest of the day. This failure was not of great importance, for the\r\nlongitude had already been satisfactorily ascertained by several very\r\ngood lunar observations, so as soon as the eclipse was over everything\r\nwas sent on board the ships, including the sheep which had been presented\r\nto Mariwaggee. No one had taken any notice of them since they were\r\nlanded, and Cook felt sure they would be killed by the dogs as soon as\r\nthe ships left. A NATIVE CEREMONY. As the wind proved contrary, and it was understood that the king's son\r\nwas to be initiated into the estate of manhood, eating with his father\r\nfor the first time, Cook determined to remain a few days longer. A party\r\nof the officers went over to the island of Moa, where the ceremony was to\r\nbe held, and found the king in a very dirty enclosure, drinking kava; and\r\nas the method of preparing this beverage was uninviting to Europeans,\r\nthey went for a walk till about ten o'clock.", "sentences": ["At one time a small hostile\r\ndemonstration was made by the natives, but the landing of a few marines\r\nand an order from the king put an end to it.", "SMART WORKMEN.", "The following day Cook was invited on shore and found some natives busy\r\nerecting two sets of poles, one on each side of the place set apart for\r\nthe guests.", "Each set consisted of four placed in a square about two feet\r\napart, secured from spreading by cross pieces, and carried up to a height\r\nof about thirty feet, the intervening space being filled with yams.", "On\r\nthe top of one structure were two baked pigs, and on the other alive one,\r\nwith a second tied by its legs about half way up.", "Cook was particularly\r\nstruck by the way the men raised these two towers, and says if he had\r\nordered his sailors to do such a thing, they would have wanted carpenters\r\nand tools and at least a hundredweight of nails, and would have taken as\r\nmany days as it did these people hours.", "When the erections were\r\ncompleted, piles of bread-fruit and yams were heaped on either side, and\r\na turtle and some excellent fish were added, and then the whole was\r\npresented to Cook.", "A party of officers from both ships went off to an island without leave,\r\nand returned two days after without their muskets, ammunition, and other\r\narticles which had been stolen.", "They persuaded Omai to make a private\r\ncomplaint to the king, which resulted in the chiefs leaving the\r\nneighbourhood.", "Their disappearance annoyed Cook, and when the affair was\r\nexplained to him he severely reprimanded Omai for speaking on the matter\r\nwithout orders.", "This put Omai on his mettle, and he managed to persuade\r\nFeenough to return, and informed the king that no serious consequences\r\nshould ensue.", "Matters were then easily smoothed over; most of the stolen\r\ngoods, including the missing turkey, were returned, and the king said he\r\nought not to have been held responsible, for, if he had known that any\r\none wished to see the island, he would have sent a chief who would have\r\nensured their safety.", "An eclipse of the sun was to occur on 5th July, and Cook decided to\r\nremain so as to secure observations, and meanwhile employed himself in\r\nexploring the neighbourhood and studying the customs of the natives.", "On\r\none occasion, thinking to see an interesting ceremony, he accompanied\r\nPolaho, who was going to do state mourning for a son who had been dead\r\nsome time.", "The result was disappointing, and the chief impression left\r\nwith Cook seems to have been that over their clothing of native cloth,\r\nthose present wore old and ragged mats; those of the king being the\r\nraggedest, and \"might have served his great-grandfather on some such like\r\noccasion.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 5th proved dark and cloudy, with heavy showers of rain, and the\r\nobservations were unsatisfactory, especially as the clouds came up\r\nthickly in the middle of the eclipse, and the sun was seen no more for\r\nthe rest of the day.", "This failure was not of great importance, for the\r\nlongitude had already been satisfactorily ascertained by several very\r\ngood lunar observations, so as soon as the eclipse was over everything\r\nwas sent on board the ships, including the sheep which had been presented\r\nto Mariwaggee.", "No one had taken any notice of them since they were\r\nlanded, and Cook felt sure they would be killed by the dogs as soon as\r\nthe ships left.", "A NATIVE CEREMONY.", "As the wind proved contrary, and it was understood that the king's son\r\nwas to be initiated into the estate of manhood, eating with his father\r\nfor the first time, Cook determined to remain a few days longer.", "A party\r\nof the officers went over to the island of Moa, where the ceremony was to\r\nbe held, and found the king in a very dirty enclosure, drinking kava; and\r\nas the method of preparing this beverage was uninviting to Europeans,\r\nthey went for a walk till about ten o'clock."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_114", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 114)", "language": "it", "content": "Finding large numbers of\r\npeople assembling in an open space near a large building they rejoined\r\nthe king, taking off their hats and untying their hair, \"that we might\r\nappear the more decent\" in the eyes of the natives.

An exhibition of boxing and wrestling was\r\nthen given, and after a speech or two the proceedings terminated. Cook\r\nwas informed that in about three months a much greater affair would take\r\nplace at which ten men would be sacrificed. On 10th July the ships sailed through a very difficult passage, arriving\r\noff Middleburg on the 12th, where they were visited by their old friend\r\nTaoofa. The country appeared flourishing, and they obtained some turnips\r\nraised from seed sown at Cook's last visit. An exhibition of boxing was\r\ngiven, and was to have been repeated the following night, but\r\nunfortunately some of the natives fell upon a sailor and stripped him of\r\nhis clothes. Cook thereupon seized two canoes and a pig, demanding that\r\nthe culprits should be given up. A man who had the shirt and trousers was\r\nbrought, and so the canoes were returned and the pig paid for, and next\r\nday the thief was liberated. The remainder of the sailor's clothes were\r\nafterwards found, but so much torn as to be worthless.

SPANISH SHIPS. Two ships from Lima were found to have visited the island twice since\r\nCook's last call, and the first time the Spaniards built a house with\r\nmaterial they had with them. They left four men in charge, and were away\r\nfor about ten months. At the second visit their Commodore died, and was\r\nburied near the house which was left at their departure, and the natives\r\nbuilt a shade over it to protect it from the weather. It consisted of two\r\nrooms, furnished with table, bed, bench, and a few other trifles, and the\r\ntimbers were found to have been carefully marked to facilitate erection. Near by was a cross having the following inscription cut on it:\r\n\r\nCHRISTUS VINCIT,\r\nCAROLUS III. IMPERAT, 1774. Cook caused to be cut on the back:\r\n\r\nGEORGIUS TERTIUS REX. ANNIS 1767, 69, 73, 74, ET 78. At the end of their first visit the Spaniards took away four natives to\r\nLima; one died, one remained at Lima, and the other two returned with the\r\nships; but Cook thinks they were not improved by their experience, and\r\nhad not added to their respectability in the eyes of their countrymen. In view of the cold climate to be faced in the near future, Cook was\r\ndesirous to save his stock of spirits, and mustered the crew of the\r\nResolution in order to explain the position; he pointed out that the\r\nsupply of coconuts was abundant, and the benefit of the spirits would be\r\nappreciated amongst the cold winds and ice of the north, but left the\r\ndecision to them. He was gratified to find the crew was willing to accept\r\nhis suggestion, and ordered Clerke to put the matter before the crew of\r\nthe Discovery, when it was again well received. An order was accordingly\r\nissued to stop:\r\n\r\n\"serving grog except on Saturday nights, when they had full allowance to\r\ndrink to their female friends in England, lest amongst the pretty girls\r\nof Otaheite, they should be wholly forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nDuring a state visit paid by the chief of the district, at which Omai\r\nattended \"dressed in a strange medley of all he was possessed of,\" Cook\r\nwas informed that the Spaniards laid claim to the country, and had given\r\ninstructions that Cook was not to be allowed to land if he returned. However, the chief executed a formal surrender of his province to Cook,\r\nand presents were exchanged, the whole ceremony ending with a display of\r\nfireworks which \"both pleased and astonished\" the natives. Some of the\r\ncivilians reported that they had discovered a Roman Catholic chapel in\r\ntheir walks; but on inspection it proved to be what Cook at once\r\nsuspected, the grave of a chief decorated with different coloured cloths\r\nand mats, and a piece of scarlet broadcloth which had been given by the\r\nSpaniards. RED FEATHERS. On the 23rd August the two ships arrived in Matavai Bay, where they were\r\nwell received by Otoo, who was gratified by a present of a fine linen\r\nsuit, a hat with a gold band, some tools, a feather helmet from the\r\nFriendly Islands, and, what he seemed to value most, a large bunch of the\r\ncelebrated red feathers. In return he sent on board the ships enough food\r\nto have lasted both crews for a week, if it had only been possible to\r\nkeep it good for that length of time. The royal family dined on board the\r\nResolution; and after dinner Cook and Omai called on Oparee, taking with\r\nthem a peacock and peahen sent to the island by Lord Bessborough, a\r\nturkey cock and hen, a gander and three geese, a drake and four ducks to\r\nmake a start in stocking the island.", "sentences": ["Cook says Omai \"would take no\r\nadvice, but permitted himself to be made the dupe of every designing\r\nknave.\" Of these red feathers Cook says they were of such value that \"not\r\nmore than might be got from a tomtit, would purchase a hog of 40 or 50\r\npounds weight.\" Nails and beads were not looked at, although they had\r\npreviously been very acceptable.", "SPANISH SHIPS.", "Two ships from Lima were found to have visited the island twice since\r\nCook's last call, and the first time the Spaniards built a house with\r\nmaterial they had with them.", "They left four men in charge, and were away\r\nfor about ten months.", "At the second visit their Commodore died, and was\r\nburied near the house which was left at their departure, and the natives\r\nbuilt a shade over it to protect it from the weather.", "It consisted of two\r\nrooms, furnished with table, bed, bench, and a few other trifles, and the\r\ntimbers were found to have been carefully marked to facilitate erection.", "Near by was a cross having the following inscription cut on it:\r\n\r\nCHRISTUS VINCIT,\r\nCAROLUS III.", "IMPERAT, 1774.", "Cook caused to be cut on the back:\r\n\r\nGEORGIUS TERTIUS REX.", "ANNIS 1767, 69, 73, 74, ET 78.", "At the end of their first visit the Spaniards took away four natives to\r\nLima; one died, one remained at Lima, and the other two returned with the\r\nships; but Cook thinks they were not improved by their experience, and\r\nhad not added to their respectability in the eyes of their countrymen.", "In view of the cold climate to be faced in the near future, Cook was\r\ndesirous to save his stock of spirits, and mustered the crew of the\r\nResolution in order to explain the position; he pointed out that the\r\nsupply of coconuts was abundant, and the benefit of the spirits would be\r\nappreciated amongst the cold winds and ice of the north, but left the\r\ndecision to them.", "He was gratified to find the crew was willing to accept\r\nhis suggestion, and ordered Clerke to put the matter before the crew of\r\nthe Discovery, when it was again well received.", "An order was accordingly\r\nissued to stop:\r\n\r\n\"serving grog except on Saturday nights, when they had full allowance to\r\ndrink to their female friends in England, lest amongst the pretty girls\r\nof Otaheite, they should be wholly forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nDuring a state visit paid by the chief of the district, at which Omai\r\nattended \"dressed in a strange medley of all he was possessed of,\" Cook\r\nwas informed that the Spaniards laid claim to the country, and had given\r\ninstructions that Cook was not to be allowed to land if he returned.", "However, the chief executed a formal surrender of his province to Cook,\r\nand presents were exchanged, the whole ceremony ending with a display of\r\nfireworks which \"both pleased and astonished\" the natives.", "Some of the\r\ncivilians reported that they had discovered a Roman Catholic chapel in\r\ntheir walks; but on inspection it proved to be what Cook at once\r\nsuspected, the grave of a chief decorated with different coloured cloths\r\nand mats, and a piece of scarlet broadcloth which had been given by the\r\nSpaniards.", "RED FEATHERS.", "On the 23rd August the two ships arrived in Matavai Bay, where they were\r\nwell received by Otoo, who was gratified by a present of a fine linen\r\nsuit, a hat with a gold band, some tools, a feather helmet from the\r\nFriendly Islands, and, what he seemed to value most, a large bunch of the\r\ncelebrated red feathers.", "In return he sent on board the ships enough food\r\nto have lasted both crews for a week, if it had only been possible to\r\nkeep it good for that length of time.", "The royal family dined on board the\r\nResolution; and after dinner Cook and Omai called on Oparee, taking with\r\nthem a peacock and peahen sent to the island by Lord Bessborough, a\r\nturkey cock and hen, a gander and three geese, a drake and four ducks to\r\nmake a start in stocking the island."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_116", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 116)", "language": "it", "content": "A gander was seen, which the natives\r\nsaid had been left by Wallis ten years previously; several goats and a\r\nbull left by the Spaniards were also seen, so Cook landed three cows as\r\ncompany for the last.

But the\r\nsatisfaction I felt in having been so fortunate as to fulfil His\r\nMajesty's design in sending such useful animals to two worthy nations\r\nsufficiently recompensed me for the many anxious hours I had on their\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst here, the two ships were thoroughly overhauled and everywhere put\r\ninto as good a state of repair as the appliances available would permit. The stores were found to be in a better state than had been expected, and\r\nvery little of the bread was damaged. Gardens were laid out and planted\r\nwith potatoes, melons, pineapples, etc.; but Cook was not very sanguine\r\nof their success, for he had seen how a vine planted by the Spaniards had\r\nbeen spitefully trampled down, as the natives, tasting the grapes before\r\nthey were ripe, had concluded it was poisonous. It was carefully pruned\r\ninto proper shape again, and Omai was instructed to set forth its merits\r\nand how it should be cultivated. Towards the end of the month a man reported that the two Spanish ships\r\nhad returned, and showed a piece of cloth he said he had obtained from\r\nthem, so Cook, not knowing if England and Spain were on friendly terms,\r\nprepared for the worst, and the two ships made ready for defence if\r\nnecessary. Lieutenant Williamson was despatched in a boat for news, but\r\ncould see no ships, nor signs of any having been on the coast since the\r\nEnglish left their last port of call. A HUMAN SACRIFICE. At their last visit an expedition was being prepared against the revolted\r\nisland of Eimeo, but it did not seem to have been very successful in its\r\nobject, for there were still disturbances going on between the two\r\nnations, and on 30th August news came that the Otaheitans had been driven\r\nup into the hills. A grand meeting was held to discuss matters, and great\r\nefforts were made to enlist the services of Cook; but he would not assist\r\nin any way, as he did not understand the cause of the quarrel, and he had\r\nalways found the inhabitants of Eimeo friendly towards him. Having heard\r\nthat a chief named Towha had killed a man as a sacrifice to their God,\r\nCook obtained permission to witness the remaining ceremonies as he\r\nthought it offered an opportunity to learn something of the religion of\r\nthis people. He therefore started with Dr. Anderson, Mr. Webber, and the\r\nchief Potatow in a boat, accompanied by Omai in a canoe, for the scene of\r\naction. On their arrival the sailors were instructed to remain in the\r\nboat, and the gentlemen were requested to remove their hats as soon as\r\nthey reached the Morai where the ceremonial was to take place. When they\r\ngot there the body of the victim was seen in a small canoe in front of\r\nthe Morai and just in the wash of the sea, in charge of four priests and\r\ntheir attendants, the king and his party some twenty or thirty paces\r\naway, and the rest of the spectators a little further still. Two priests\r\ncame forward to Otoo, one placing a young plantain tree in front of him,\r\nand the other touching his foot with a bunch of red feathers, and then\r\nrejoining the others, who immediately went off to a smaller Morai near,\r\nand, seating themselves facing the sea, one commenced reciting a long\r\nprayer, occasionally sending one of his attendants to place a young\r\nplantain on the body. Whilst this recitation was going on an attendant\r\nstood near holding two small bundles \"seemingly of cloth; in one, as we\r\nafterwards found, was the Royal Maro, and the other, if I may be allowed\r\nthe expression, was the ark of the Eatua\" [God].", "sentences": ["A gander was seen, which the natives\r\nsaid had been left by Wallis ten years previously; several goats and a\r\nbull left by the Spaniards were also seen, so Cook landed three cows as\r\ncompany for the last.", "The horses and sheep were also landed, and Cook\r\nremarks that getting rid of all these animals lightened him:\r\n\r\n\"of a very heavy burden; the trouble and vexation that attended the\r\nbringing these animals thus far is hardly to be conceived.", "But the\r\nsatisfaction I felt in having been so fortunate as to fulfil His\r\nMajesty's design in sending such useful animals to two worthy nations\r\nsufficiently recompensed me for the many anxious hours I had on their\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst here, the two ships were thoroughly overhauled and everywhere put\r\ninto as good a state of repair as the appliances available would permit.", "The stores were found to be in a better state than had been expected, and\r\nvery little of the bread was damaged.", "Gardens were laid out and planted\r\nwith potatoes, melons, pineapples, etc.; but Cook was not very sanguine\r\nof their success, for he had seen how a vine planted by the Spaniards had\r\nbeen spitefully trampled down, as the natives, tasting the grapes before\r\nthey were ripe, had concluded it was poisonous.", "It was carefully pruned\r\ninto proper shape again, and Omai was instructed to set forth its merits\r\nand how it should be cultivated.", "Towards the end of the month a man reported that the two Spanish ships\r\nhad returned, and showed a piece of cloth he said he had obtained from\r\nthem, so Cook, not knowing if England and Spain were on friendly terms,\r\nprepared for the worst, and the two ships made ready for defence if\r\nnecessary.", "Lieutenant Williamson was despatched in a boat for news, but\r\ncould see no ships, nor signs of any having been on the coast since the\r\nEnglish left their last port of call.", "A HUMAN SACRIFICE.", "At their last visit an expedition was being prepared against the revolted\r\nisland of Eimeo, but it did not seem to have been very successful in its\r\nobject, for there were still disturbances going on between the two\r\nnations, and on 30th August news came that the Otaheitans had been driven\r\nup into the hills.", "A grand meeting was held to discuss matters, and great\r\nefforts were made to enlist the services of Cook; but he would not assist\r\nin any way, as he did not understand the cause of the quarrel, and he had\r\nalways found the inhabitants of Eimeo friendly towards him.", "Having heard\r\nthat a chief named Towha had killed a man as a sacrifice to their God,\r\nCook obtained permission to witness the remaining ceremonies as he\r\nthought it offered an opportunity to learn something of the religion of\r\nthis people.", "He therefore started with Dr.", "Anderson, Mr.", "Webber, and the\r\nchief Potatow in a boat, accompanied by Omai in a canoe, for the scene of\r\naction.", "On their arrival the sailors were instructed to remain in the\r\nboat, and the gentlemen were requested to remove their hats as soon as\r\nthey reached the Morai where the ceremonial was to take place.", "When they\r\ngot there the body of the victim was seen in a small canoe in front of\r\nthe Morai and just in the wash of the sea, in charge of four priests and\r\ntheir attendants, the king and his party some twenty or thirty paces\r\naway, and the rest of the spectators a little further still.", "Two priests\r\ncame forward to Otoo, one placing a young plantain tree in front of him,\r\nand the other touching his foot with a bunch of red feathers, and then\r\nrejoining the others, who immediately went off to a smaller Morai near,\r\nand, seating themselves facing the sea, one commenced reciting a long\r\nprayer, occasionally sending one of his attendants to place a young\r\nplantain on the body.", "Whilst this recitation was going on an attendant\r\nstood near holding two small bundles \"seemingly of cloth; in one, as we\r\nafterwards found, was the Royal Maro, and the other, if I may be allowed\r\nthe expression, was the ark of the Eatua\" [God]."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_117", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 117)", "language": "it", "content": "This prayer being ended, the priests returned to the beach, and more\r\nprayers were said, the plantains being moved, one by one, from the body\r\nand placed in front of the priests. Then the body, wrapped in leaves, was\r\nput on the beach, with the feet to the sea, and the priests gathered\r\nround, some sitting, some standing, the prayers still going on. The\r\nleaves were then stripped off the body, and it was turned sideways on to\r\nthe sea, and one priest standing at the feet repeated another long prayer\r\nin which he was occasionally joined by the others. Each priest at this\r\ntime held in his hand a bunch of the red feathers. Some hair was now\r\npulled from the head of the corpse, and an eye taken out, wrapped in\r\nleaves and presented to Otoo, who did not touch them, but sent them back\r\nwith a bunch of feathers, soon after sending a second bunch he had asked\r\nCook to put in his pocket for him when starting. At this time a\r\nking-fisher made a noise in some trees near, and Otoo remarked, \"That is\r\nthe Eatua,\" evidently looking on it as a good omen. The body was now moved away to the foot of one of the small Morais, the\r\ntwo bundles of cloth being placed on the Morai at its head and the tufts\r\nof feathers at its feet, the priests surrounding the body and the people\r\ngathering in closer. More speeches were made, and a second lock of hair\r\nplucked from the head and placed on the Morai. Then the red feathers were\r\nplaced on the cloth bundles, which were carried over to the great Morai\r\nand laid against a pile of stones, to which the body was also brought,\r\nand the attendants proceeded to dig a grave, whilst the priests continued\r\ntheir recitations. The body was then buried, and a dog Towha had sent\r\nover (a very poor one, says Cook) was partially cooked and presented to\r\nthe priests, who called on Eatua to come and see what was prepared for\r\nhim, at the same time putting it on a small altar on which were the\r\nremains of two dogs and three pigs, which smelt so intolerably that the\r\nwhite men were compelled to move further away than they wished. This\r\nended the ceremony for the day. THE KING'S MARO. Next morning they all returned to the Morai; a pig was sacrificed and\r\nplaced on the same altar, and about eight o'clock the priests, Otoo, and\r\na great number of people assembled. The two bundles were still in the\r\nsame place as on the previous night, but two drums were now standing in\r\nfront of them between which Otoo and Cook seated themselves. The priests,\r\nplacing a plantain tree in front of the king, resumed their praying, each\r\nhaving his bunch of feathers in his hand. They then moved off to a place\r\nbetween the Morai and the king and placed the feathers bunch by bunch on\r\nthe bundles, the prayers still going on. Four pigs were then produced,\r\none immediately killed, and the others put in a sty for future use. The\r\nbundle containing the king's Maro was now untied and spread carefully on\r\nthe ground before the priests. The Maro was about five yards long by\r\nfifteen inches broad, composed of red and yellow feathers, chiefly\r\nyellow. At one end was a border of eight pieces about the size and shape\r\nof horse-shoes fringed with black pigeon's feathers; the other end was\r\nforked, the ends being of unequal length. The feathers were arranged in\r\ntwo rows and had a very good effect. They were fastened on a piece of\r\nnative cloth, and then sewn to the English pendant which Wallis left\r\nflying when he sailed from Matavai Bay. After the priests had repeated\r\nanother prayer, the emblem of royalty was carefully folded up and\r\nreplaced on the Morai, and then one end of what Cook called the Ark of\r\nthe Eatua was opened, but the visitors were not permitted to see what it\r\ncontained. The entrails of the pig were then prayed over, and one of the\r\npriests stirred them gently with a stick, evidently trying to draw a\r\nfavourable omen from their movements.", "sentences": ["This prayer being ended, the priests returned to the beach, and more\r\nprayers were said, the plantains being moved, one by one, from the body\r\nand placed in front of the priests.", "Then the body, wrapped in leaves, was\r\nput on the beach, with the feet to the sea, and the priests gathered\r\nround, some sitting, some standing, the prayers still going on.", "The\r\nleaves were then stripped off the body, and it was turned sideways on to\r\nthe sea, and one priest standing at the feet repeated another long prayer\r\nin which he was occasionally joined by the others.", "Each priest at this\r\ntime held in his hand a bunch of the red feathers.", "Some hair was now\r\npulled from the head of the corpse, and an eye taken out, wrapped in\r\nleaves and presented to Otoo, who did not touch them, but sent them back\r\nwith a bunch of feathers, soon after sending a second bunch he had asked\r\nCook to put in his pocket for him when starting.", "At this time a\r\nking-fisher made a noise in some trees near, and Otoo remarked, \"That is\r\nthe Eatua,\" evidently looking on it as a good omen.", "The body was now moved away to the foot of one of the small Morais, the\r\ntwo bundles of cloth being placed on the Morai at its head and the tufts\r\nof feathers at its feet, the priests surrounding the body and the people\r\ngathering in closer.", "More speeches were made, and a second lock of hair\r\nplucked from the head and placed on the Morai.", "Then the red feathers were\r\nplaced on the cloth bundles, which were carried over to the great Morai\r\nand laid against a pile of stones, to which the body was also brought,\r\nand the attendants proceeded to dig a grave, whilst the priests continued\r\ntheir recitations.", "The body was then buried, and a dog Towha had sent\r\nover (a very poor one, says Cook) was partially cooked and presented to\r\nthe priests, who called on Eatua to come and see what was prepared for\r\nhim, at the same time putting it on a small altar on which were the\r\nremains of two dogs and three pigs, which smelt so intolerably that the\r\nwhite men were compelled to move further away than they wished.", "This\r\nended the ceremony for the day.", "THE KING'S MARO.", "Next morning they all returned to the Morai; a pig was sacrificed and\r\nplaced on the same altar, and about eight o'clock the priests, Otoo, and\r\na great number of people assembled.", "The two bundles were still in the\r\nsame place as on the previous night, but two drums were now standing in\r\nfront of them between which Otoo and Cook seated themselves.", "The priests,\r\nplacing a plantain tree in front of the king, resumed their praying, each\r\nhaving his bunch of feathers in his hand.", "They then moved off to a place\r\nbetween the Morai and the king and placed the feathers bunch by bunch on\r\nthe bundles, the prayers still going on.", "Four pigs were then produced,\r\none immediately killed, and the others put in a sty for future use.", "The\r\nbundle containing the king's Maro was now untied and spread carefully on\r\nthe ground before the priests.", "The Maro was about five yards long by\r\nfifteen inches broad, composed of red and yellow feathers, chiefly\r\nyellow.", "At one end was a border of eight pieces about the size and shape\r\nof horse-shoes fringed with black pigeon's feathers; the other end was\r\nforked, the ends being of unequal length.", "The feathers were arranged in\r\ntwo rows and had a very good effect.", "They were fastened on a piece of\r\nnative cloth, and then sewn to the English pendant which Wallis left\r\nflying when he sailed from Matavai Bay.", "After the priests had repeated\r\nanother prayer, the emblem of royalty was carefully folded up and\r\nreplaced on the Morai, and then one end of what Cook called the Ark of\r\nthe Eatua was opened, but the visitors were not permitted to see what it\r\ncontained.", "The entrails of the pig were then prayed over, and one of the\r\npriests stirred them gently with a stick, evidently trying to draw a\r\nfavourable omen from their movements."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_118", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 118)", "language": "it", "content": "They were then thrown on the fire,\r\nthe partly-cooked pig was deposited on the altar, and when the bunches of\r\nfeathers that had been used had been placed in the Ark, the ceremony was\r\nover. The meanings of all this could not be discovered, but it was found that\r\nwhen a victim was wanted, a chief picked him out and sent his servants to\r\nkill him. This was done without any warning to the man who was to suffer,\r\nusually by a blow with a stone on the head, and it appeared that at the\r\nsubsequent ceremony the presence of the king was absolutely\r\nindispensable. Chiefs of an enemy's tribe who were killed in battle were\r\nburied with some state in the Morais, the common men at the foot. On the way back to the ship Cook called on Towha, who had supplied the\r\nvictim. He was anxious to ascertain Cook's opinion of the affair, and was\r\nnot pleased to learn that Cook thought such a proceeding was more likely\r\nto offend the Deity than to please him. He then enquired if the English\r\never practised such ceremonies, and was very angry when he was informed\r\nthat if the greatest chief in England killed one of his men he would be\r\nhanged; and Cook says they left him \"with as great a contempt for our\r\ncustoms as we could possibly have for theirs.\" The servants evidently\r\nlistened to Omai with great interest and a different opinion on the\r\nsubject than that of their master. They went to inspect the body of a chief who had been embalmed; they were\r\nnot allowed to examine it very closely, but it was so well done that they\r\nwere unable to perceive the slightest unpleasant smell, though the man\r\nhad been dead some months. All chiefs who died a natural death were\r\npreserved in this manner, and from time to time were exposed to public\r\nview, the intervals between the exposures gradually extending till at\r\nlength they were hardly ever seen. The method of preservation was not\r\nascertained, and was probably a secret of the priests. EQUESTRIAN EXERCISE. Cook and Clerke astonished the natives by riding the horses that had been\r\nbrought out; their progress through the country was always watched with\r\ngreat interest, and Cook thought that this use of the animals impressed\r\nthe people more than anything else done by the whites. Omai tried his\r\npowers on several occasions, but as he was always thrown before he got\r\nsecurely into the saddle, his efforts only produced entertainment for the\r\nspectators. It is curious to note that forty years afterwards the people\r\nhad so thoroughly lost even the tradition of such use of the horse that\r\nMr. Ellis relates how, when one was landed for the use of Pomare, the\r\nnatives assisted to get it ashore, but when once landed they ran away and\r\nhid in fear of the \"man-carrying pig.\" About this time Cook suffered from\r\na bad attack of rheumatism in the legs, and was successfully treated by\r\nOtoo's mother, three sisters, and eight other women. The process he\r\nunderwent, called Romy, consisted of squeezing and kneading from head to\r\nfoot, more especially about the parts affected. Cook says he was glad to\r\nescape from their ministrations after about a quarter of an hour, but he\r\nfelt relief, and, after submitting to four operations of the kind he was\r\ncompletely cured. Otoo was very desirous to send a present of a canoe to King George, and\r\nCook was very willing to take it, but when he found it was a large double\r\ncanoe he was obliged to decline from want of space. As the desire to send\r\nit was quite spontaneous on Otoo's part, and as the canoe was a very fine\r\nspecimen of native work, the refusal was given with great regret. In a journal published by Newbery, the anonymous writer says that two\r\nofficers fought a duel whilst the ships were at Otaheite.

Of this defect he\r\nseemed much ashamed, and always appeared with his head covered with a\r\nsort of turban. Cook thinks perhaps this shame rose from the fact that\r\nnatives caught stealing on the ships were often punished by having their\r\nheads shaved, and adds that \"one or two of the gentlemen whose heads were\r\nnot overburdened with hair, lay under violent suspicions of being titos\r\n(thieves).\"\r\n\r\nOne of the few remaining goats was stolen, but after threats of serious\r\nreprisals was given up, together with the thief, who was eventually\r\ndischarged with a caution; but on a second one disappearing and not being\r\nfound after careful search, Cook felt that he must make an example, or\r\nnothing would be safe, so he ordered one or two houses and canoes to be\r\ndestroyed, and sent word to Maheine that he would not leave a canoe on\r\nthe island if the goat was not returned. The goat was recovered, and the\r\nnext day the people were as friendly as if nothing had occurred. Cook was\r\nparticularly annoyed, for he had sent a present of red feathers to Otoo,\r\nand requested him to send in return a couple of goats to Eimeo. OMAI SETTLED. On 11th October the ships sailed for Huaheine, and when they arrived Cook\r\nwas so ill he had to be landed from the ship, but he makes no mention of\r\nit in his Journal. He thought this island would be more suitable for Omai\r\nthan Otaheite, and as Omai was agreeable a piece of ground was obtained\r\nfrom the chief and a small house erected and a garden laid out and\r\nplanted. The interest of the different chiefs of the neighbourhood was\r\nsought on Omai's behalf, and as it was seen that some of the natives were\r\ninclined to take advantage of his good nature, Cook let it be understood\r\nthat if, should he return and find Omai in an satisfactory condition,\r\nsome one would feel the weight of his displeasure. Then the most serious\r\nthing that can be brought against Cook's treatment of the natives\r\noccurred. In extenuation it must be remembered that he admits that he was\r\ninclined to be hot-tempered, though it did not last; he had been\r\nconstantly irritated by repeated losses, and he was at the time really\r\nseriously ill, and also when all was over he sincerely regretted he had\r\ntaken such strong measures. Mr. Bayley's sextant was stolen from the observatory: Cook at once\r\ndemanded from the chiefs that it should be returned, but they paid no\r\nattention. The thief, however, was pointed out, seized, and taken on\r\nboard ship; the sextant was recovered, but Cook says, finding the thief\r\nto be \"a hardened scoundrel, I punished him with greater severity than I\r\nhave ever done any one before, and then dismissed him.\" He is said to\r\nhave had his head shaved and his ears cut off, but Gilbert (midshipman on\r\nthe Discovery) says this was not done till he had been rearrested for\r\ndamaging Omai's garden, trying to set fire to the house, and threatening\r\nto kill Omai as soon as the ships left. Cook had intended to remove him\r\nfrom the island, but, being in irons, he stole the keys from a sleeping\r\nguard and made his escape. Omai found that many of the articles which\r\nwere practically useless to him, would be appreciated on the ships, so he\r\nvery wisely changed them for hatchets and other useful articles. A notice\r\nof the visit with the names of the ships was cut on the end of Omai's\r\nhouse, and, after firing a salute of five guns, the ships sailed on 2nd\r\nNovember.

DESERTIONS.", "sentences": ["On 29th September, after giving Otoo a short run out to sea and back, the\r\ntwo ships sailed for the north side of Eimeo, arriving the next day, and\r\nwere greeted by a chief, Maheine, who was bald-headed.", "Of this defect he\r\nseemed much ashamed, and always appeared with his head covered with a\r\nsort of turban.", "Cook thinks perhaps this shame rose from the fact that\r\nnatives caught stealing on the ships were often punished by having their\r\nheads shaved, and adds that \"one or two of the gentlemen whose heads were\r\nnot overburdened with hair, lay under violent suspicions of being titos\r\n(thieves).\"\r\n\r\nOne of the few remaining goats was stolen, but after threats of serious\r\nreprisals was given up, together with the thief, who was eventually\r\ndischarged with a caution; but on a second one disappearing and not being\r\nfound after careful search, Cook felt that he must make an example, or\r\nnothing would be safe, so he ordered one or two houses and canoes to be\r\ndestroyed, and sent word to Maheine that he would not leave a canoe on\r\nthe island if the goat was not returned.", "The goat was recovered, and the\r\nnext day the people were as friendly as if nothing had occurred.", "Cook was\r\nparticularly annoyed, for he had sent a present of red feathers to Otoo,\r\nand requested him to send in return a couple of goats to Eimeo.", "OMAI SETTLED.", "On 11th October the ships sailed for Huaheine, and when they arrived Cook\r\nwas so ill he had to be landed from the ship, but he makes no mention of\r\nit in his Journal.", "He thought this island would be more suitable for Omai\r\nthan Otaheite, and as Omai was agreeable a piece of ground was obtained\r\nfrom the chief and a small house erected and a garden laid out and\r\nplanted.", "The interest of the different chiefs of the neighbourhood was\r\nsought on Omai's behalf, and as it was seen that some of the natives were\r\ninclined to take advantage of his good nature, Cook let it be understood\r\nthat if, should he return and find Omai in an satisfactory condition,\r\nsome one would feel the weight of his displeasure.", "Then the most serious\r\nthing that can be brought against Cook's treatment of the natives\r\noccurred.", "In extenuation it must be remembered that he admits that he was\r\ninclined to be hot-tempered, though it did not last; he had been\r\nconstantly irritated by repeated losses, and he was at the time really\r\nseriously ill, and also when all was over he sincerely regretted he had\r\ntaken such strong measures.", "Mr.", "Bayley's sextant was stolen from the observatory: Cook at once\r\ndemanded from the chiefs that it should be returned, but they paid no\r\nattention.", "The thief, however, was pointed out, seized, and taken on\r\nboard ship; the sextant was recovered, but Cook says, finding the thief\r\nto be \"a hardened scoundrel, I punished him with greater severity than I\r\nhave ever done any one before, and then dismissed him.\" He is said to\r\nhave had his head shaved and his ears cut off, but Gilbert (midshipman on\r\nthe Discovery) says this was not done till he had been rearrested for\r\ndamaging Omai's garden, trying to set fire to the house, and threatening\r\nto kill Omai as soon as the ships left.", "Cook had intended to remove him\r\nfrom the island, but, being in irons, he stole the keys from a sleeping\r\nguard and made his escape.", "Omai found that many of the articles which\r\nwere practically useless to him, would be appreciated on the ships, so he\r\nvery wisely changed them for hatchets and other useful articles.", "A notice\r\nof the visit with the names of the ships was cut on the end of Omai's\r\nhouse, and, after firing a salute of five guns, the ships sailed on 2nd\r\nNovember.", "Omai accompanied them for a short way, and Mr.", "King says that\r\nwhen he parted from Cook he completely broke down and cried all the way\r\nashore.", "Cook speaks well of him, saying he seldom had to find fault with\r\nhim, that he had many good qualities, but, like the rest of his race, he\r\nlacked powers of observation, application, and perseverance.", "DESERTIONS."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_120", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 120)", "language": "it", "content": "On the 3rd they were off Ulietea, and as they were able to run in close\r\nto the shore a staging was erected, and the ballast ports were opened so\r\nas to give the rats, which had become very troublesome, a chance of going\r\nashore. One of the marines also took the opportunity to desert, taking\r\nhis musket with him, but after a little trouble was arrested; and having\r\npreviously borne a very good character, he was let off with a short\r\nimprisonment. A second desertion occurred from the Discovery, Mr. Mouat,\r\nmidshipman, and a seaman getting away. Cook says the affair gave him more\r\ntrouble than both men were worth, but he insisted on getting them back to\r\nprevent others following their example, and \"to save the son of a brother\r\nofficer from being lost to the world.\" They were found to have gone off\r\nin a canoe to another island, and Cook ordered Clerke to detain the\r\nchief, his son, daughter, and son-in-law on the Discovery, where they had\r\ngone to dine, and to inform them they would be kept as hostages till the\r\nrunaways were returned.

Then he\r\nwas to sail on 1st April to 56 degrees North, and again cruise about\r\nfifteen leagues from the coast till 10th May, when he was to proceed\r\nnorth and endeavour to find a passage to the Atlantic, according to the\r\nAdmiralty instructions already in his hands. If unsuccessful he was to\r\nwinter in some suitable port of Kamtschatka, leaving word with the\r\ncommandant of St. Peter and St. Paul Harbour, where he was to be found,\r\nand to be at the last-named place not later than 10th May of the\r\nfollowing year. Then, if he had no news of the Resolution, he was to\r\nfollow out the Admiralty instructions to the best of his ability. The two ships left for Bolabola on 7th December to get an anchor left by\r\nDe Bougainville, in order to make hatchets for exchange, as the demand\r\nhad been so great their stock was running short. They had no difficulty\r\nin purchasing it, and it was good enough for their purpose, though not so\r\nheavy as they expected.

About\r\nthree hundred turtle were obtained, averaging from 90 to 100 pounds each,\r\nand as much fish as they could consume during their stay was caught. Coconuts, yams, and melons were planted, and the island received the name\r\nof Christmas Island. SANDWICH ISLANDS.

As the ships\r\nsailed on, more canoes came out bringing further supplies, and Cook\r\nrejoiced at arriving at a land of plenty, for his stock of turtle was\r\njust finished, and he was anxious to save his sea stores. At length some\r\nwere tempted on board, and were greatly astonished at what they saw, but\r\ntheir wonder did not last long, and stealing soon broke out as usual. When they came to an anchor Cook landed and found a favourable place for\r\nwatering, so a party was set to work the next day, and found no\r\ndifficulty in getting assistance from the islanders, whilst at the same\r\ntime a brisk trade was carried on in pigs and potatoes. Cook says: \"No\r\npeople could trade with more honesty than these people, never once\r\nattempting to cheat us, either ashore or alongside the ship.\" They seem\r\nto have dropped their thieving very quickly. At night a nasty sea got up,\r\nand as Cook did not like the position of his ship he weighed to run a\r\nlittle further out, but the wind suddenly dropping round to the east, he\r\nhad to set all sail to clear the shore. For a day or two no very\r\nsatisfactory anchorage could be found, and the weather was rather\r\nunsettled, so, making one of the chiefs a present of an English sow and\r\nboar, and a male and two female goats, the ship bore away to the\r\nnorthwards. According to Baron von Humboldt these islands were discovered by a\r\nSpaniard, Gaetano, sailing from Manilla to Acapulco in 1542, and it was\r\none of the few discoveries made by the Spaniards during this passage, for\r\nthey were strictly forbidden to deviate from the track laid down on their\r\ncharts. The name La Mesa (the table) down on the chart Cook had with him,\r\ndescribes the island, says Burney, but the longitude is several degrees\r\nout. It is undoubtedly a fact that Europeans had been at the islands\r\npreviously to Cook's visit, for at least two pieces of iron were found,\r\none being a portion of a broad-sword and the other a piece of hoop-iron. NEW ALBION. On 7th March, New Albion was sighted at a distance of ten or twelve\r\nleagues, and the position of the ship at noon was 44 degrees 33 minutes\r\nNorth, 236 degrees 30 minutes East; Cook's orders were to make the coast\r\n\"about 45 degrees North,\" so they may be said to have been carried out\r\nwith fair exactness. Cook says that on the charts he had, a large\r\nentrance or strait was represented, and in the account of Martin\r\nd'Aguilar's voyage in 1603 mention is made of a large river, near where\r\nhe struck the coast, but he did not see any signs of either. Proceeding\r\nup the coast the progress was very slow as the weather was very stormy. On 22nd March they passed the position of the strait of Juan de Fuch, but\r\nagain no sign of its existence was seen. On the 29th the style of the\r\ncoast changed, and high snowy mountains with well-wooded valleys running\r\ndown to the sea came into view, and at length Hope Bay opened out. Here\r\nthey came in contact with the first natives they had seen, who put off in\r\ntheir canoes to the ships, showing signs neither of fear nor distrust. At\r\nfirst they appeared mild and inoffensive, and would trade anything they\r\nhad with them; but when they got used to the ships it turned out that\r\nthey were adepts at thieving; no piece of iron, brass, or copper was\r\nsafe. Fish-hooks were cut from the lines and boats were stripped of their\r\nfittings. They sold bladders of oil for the lamps, and it was found that\r\nthey were often partly filled with water, but this was winked at in order\r\nto get on a thoroughly friendly footing.", "sentences": ["At the\r\nsecond one seen, called Atoui by the natives, they were quickly\r\nsurrounded by canoes; the occupants, very like the Otaheitans in\r\nappearance and language, were armed with stones, which they threw\r\noverboard as soon as they found they were not likely to be wanted, and\r\nthough none could be persuaded to come on board the ships, they freely\r\nparted with fish for anything they could get in exchange.", "As the ships\r\nsailed on, more canoes came out bringing further supplies, and Cook\r\nrejoiced at arriving at a land of plenty, for his stock of turtle was\r\njust finished, and he was anxious to save his sea stores.", "At length some\r\nwere tempted on board, and were greatly astonished at what they saw, but\r\ntheir wonder did not last long, and stealing soon broke out as usual.", "When they came to an anchor Cook landed and found a favourable place for\r\nwatering, so a party was set to work the next day, and found no\r\ndifficulty in getting assistance from the islanders, whilst at the same\r\ntime a brisk trade was carried on in pigs and potatoes.", "Cook says: \"No\r\npeople could trade with more honesty than these people, never once\r\nattempting to cheat us, either ashore or alongside the ship.\" They seem\r\nto have dropped their thieving very quickly.", "At night a nasty sea got up,\r\nand as Cook did not like the position of his ship he weighed to run a\r\nlittle further out, but the wind suddenly dropping round to the east, he\r\nhad to set all sail to clear the shore.", "For a day or two no very\r\nsatisfactory anchorage could be found, and the weather was rather\r\nunsettled, so, making one of the chiefs a present of an English sow and\r\nboar, and a male and two female goats, the ship bore away to the\r\nnorthwards.", "According to Baron von Humboldt these islands were discovered by a\r\nSpaniard, Gaetano, sailing from Manilla to Acapulco in 1542, and it was\r\none of the few discoveries made by the Spaniards during this passage, for\r\nthey were strictly forbidden to deviate from the track laid down on their\r\ncharts.", "The name La Mesa (the table) down on the chart Cook had with him,\r\ndescribes the island, says Burney, but the longitude is several degrees\r\nout.", "It is undoubtedly a fact that Europeans had been at the islands\r\npreviously to Cook's visit, for at least two pieces of iron were found,\r\none being a portion of a broad-sword and the other a piece of hoop-iron.", "NEW ALBION.", "On 7th March, New Albion was sighted at a distance of ten or twelve\r\nleagues, and the position of the ship at noon was 44 degrees 33 minutes\r\nNorth, 236 degrees 30 minutes East; Cook's orders were to make the coast\r\n\"about 45 degrees North,\" so they may be said to have been carried out\r\nwith fair exactness.", "Cook says that on the charts he had, a large\r\nentrance or strait was represented, and in the account of Martin\r\nd'Aguilar's voyage in 1603 mention is made of a large river, near where\r\nhe struck the coast, but he did not see any signs of either.", "Proceeding\r\nup the coast the progress was very slow as the weather was very stormy.", "On 22nd March they passed the position of the strait of Juan de Fuch, but\r\nagain no sign of its existence was seen.", "On the 29th the style of the\r\ncoast changed, and high snowy mountains with well-wooded valleys running\r\ndown to the sea came into view, and at length Hope Bay opened out.", "Here\r\nthey came in contact with the first natives they had seen, who put off in\r\ntheir canoes to the ships, showing signs neither of fear nor distrust.", "At\r\nfirst they appeared mild and inoffensive, and would trade anything they\r\nhad with them; but when they got used to the ships it turned out that\r\nthey were adepts at thieving; no piece of iron, brass, or copper was\r\nsafe.", "Fish-hooks were cut from the lines and boats were stripped of their\r\nfittings.", "They sold bladders of oil for the lamps, and it was found that\r\nthey were often partly filled with water, but this was winked at in order\r\nto get on a thoroughly friendly footing."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_122", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 122)", "language": "it", "content": "This being a favourable\r\nopportunity to put the two vessels in order and to give the crews a spell\r\nof rest ashore, a good anchorage was sought out, and the observatory set\r\nup.

The gale lasted two days, but on the\r\nsecond they were able to get an observation which gave the position of\r\nthe ship as 50 degrees 1 minute North, 229 degrees 26 minutes East, about\r\nopposite to where the Straits of de Fonte were marked on his chart. They\r\nwere now able to run along the coast and see and name the most salient\r\npoints, but time was too valuable to make any halts by the way. The land\r\nappeared to be of considerable height, the hills covered with snow, but\r\nnear the sea, well wooded. Mount St. Elias was sighted 4th May, at a\r\ndistance of forty leagues, and on the 6th they arrived in the bay in\r\nwhich Behring had anchored, so his name was given to it on the chart.

TWO SETS OF TEETH. Bad weather detaining them, Cook had an opportunity of studying the\r\ninhabitants. He had with him a description of the Esquimaux, by Crantz,\r\nand found these men to be very similar in appearance, dress, and\r\nappliances. They all had the bottom lip slit horizontally, giving them\r\nthe appearance of having two mouths. In these slits pieces of bone were\r\nfixed to which were tied other pieces, forming a great impediment to\r\ntheir speech, and in some cases giving the idea that the wearer had two\r\nsets of teeth. Some also had pieces of bone, cord, or beads run through\r\nthe cartilage of the nose, and all had their faces plentifully smeared\r\nwith black and red paint. After examining an inlet, which received the name of Sandwich Sound, they\r\ngot away, steering to the south-west past Cape Elizabeth, sighted on that\r\nPrincess's birthday, which they hoped would prove the western extremity\r\nof the coast, but on getting round, land was reported further on to the\r\nwest-south-west, and a gale sprang up, forcing them off their course. In\r\ntwo days they worked back again, discovering more land behind what they\r\nhad seen already. This Cook believed to be Cape Saint Hermogenes\r\nmentioned by Behring, but his chart was so inaccurate he could not\r\npositively identify it, or any other place mentioned on it. Cape Douglas,\r\nafter the Dean of Windsor, was named, and placed in 58 degrees 56 minutes\r\nNorth, 206 degrees 10 minutes East; and the next day a high point in a\r\nrange was called Mount St. Augustine, after the saint whose day it\r\nhappened to be. They then worked into an estuary formed by the rivers\r\n(one being afterwards named Cook's River, by orders of Lord Sandwich), in\r\norder to satisfy some of the officers who thought there might be a\r\npossible communication with Hudson's Bay. A good supply of very fine\r\nsalmon was obtained from natives in the neighbourhood, and Cook formed\r\nthe opinion that a paying fur trade might be opened up as the skins\r\noffered were of considerable value. Working slowly up the coast they passed through the islands off Quelpart\r\non the 18th, when the Discovery signalled to speak; a boat was sent, and\r\nreturned with a small box curiously tied up with neatly-made twine. It\r\nhad been delivered on board by an Indian, who first attracted attention\r\nby displaying a pair of old plush breeches and a black cloth waistcoat,\r\nand when he came on board, took off his cap and bowed like a European. The box was found to contain a paper written in Russian, but\r\nunfortunately the only things that could be understood were the two\r\ndates, 1776 and 1778.

On the 20th, in 54 degrees 18 minutes North, 195 degrees 45 minutes East,\r\na volcano throwing out dense smoke was observed; and in the afternoon\r\nthey received a visit from a man who had evidently been in contact with\r\nEuropeans, for he was wearing green cloth breeches and a stuff jacket.

On 27th June they were off the island of Onalaschka, and came across a\r\nparty of natives who were towing two whales they had killed; they were\r\nsomewhat shy, but had evidently seen ships before, and were more polite\r\nthan those previously met with. One was upset from his canoe, and Cook\r\ntook him down into the cabin and provided him with dry clothes; \"he\r\ndressed himself with as much ease as I could have done.\" His clothes were\r\nof birds' skins, the feathers inside, and patched in places with silk,\r\nand over all he wore a sort of shirt of whale's intestine, which, secured\r\nround the edge of the hole in which he sat in his canoe, rendered him\r\npractically waterproof. Whilst in this neighbourhood they received a\r\nsecond letter in Russian, but having no one on board who could translate,\r\nit was returned with some presents to the bearer, who retired bowing his\r\nthanks. After some detention from fogs and adverse winds they got away\r\nonce more and pushed slowly northwards. On 3rd August Mr. Anderson the\r\nsurgeon, who had been ill for some months, died, and Cook, having named\r\nan island, sighted soon after his death, Anderson's Island, \"to\r\nperpetuate the memory of the deceased, for whom I had a very great\r\nregard,\" appointed Mr. Law to the Resolution and Mr. Samwell to the\r\nDiscovery as surgeons. On 9th August, Cape Prince of Wales, 65 degrees 46 minutes North, 191\r\ndegrees 45 minutes East, was sighted, and they believed it to be the most\r\nwesterly point of North America. They landed on what, from Heydinger's\r\nChart, was the eastern end of the island of Alaska, but it afterwards was\r\nfound to be the eastern extremity of Asia. This chart, says Burney, was\r\nfound \"not only to be incorrect but almost unintelligible.\" The country\r\nwas very desolate, neither tree nor shrub to be seen, and the inhabitants\r\nseemed afraid of their visitors, though not absolutely unfriendly. They\r\nwere taller and stouter than those on the American side, and their\r\nclothing very superior. The ships fell in with the ice blink on the 17th, in 70 degrees 33\r\nminutes North, 197 degrees 41 minutes East, rather earlier than had been\r\nexpected, and soon afterwards with the ice itself in the shape of a large\r\nfield extending as far as the eye could reach from west to east. Here\r\nthey got a supply of fresh meat in the shape of sea-horse, of which\r\nanimal they killed a good many. The flesh was fishy and indifferent\r\neating, but Cook says anything was preferable to salt meat. They still slowly but steadily pushed north along the American shore,\r\nbut, being hampered by fog and ice, they crossed over to the west side\r\nwith no better fortune, for on the 26th they found themselves embayed in\r\nthe field with large quantities of heavy loose ice along the edges. Having sighted Cape North on 29th August, Cook decided the season was too\r\nfar advanced, and that it would be better to proceed to winter quarters,\r\nand accordingly ran down the Asiatic coast in search of wood and water,\r\nof which he stood in need; but was disappointed, and making over to the\r\nother side was fortunate to find a considerable quantity of driftwood\r\nwhich served his purpose. Before leaving the straits, Cook remarks:\r\n\r\n\"In justice to Behring's memory, I must say he delineated this coast very\r\nwell, and fixed the latitude and longitude of the points better than\r\ncould be expected from the methods he had to go by.\"\r\n\r\nSALMON PIE.", "sentences": ["On 26th June they had a narrow escape during a thick fog, when it was not\r\npossible to see anything a hundred yards away.", "Breakers were heard, so\r\nthe anchors were let go and fortunately held.", "An hour or so after the fog\r\nlifted, and they found themselves about three-quarters of a mile from a\r\nrocky island, having passed between two elevated rocks, a place through\r\nwith, Cook says, \"I should have ventured on a clear day,\" for all that\r\nthey found themselves in \"such an anchoring place that I could not have\r\nchosen a better.\"\r\n\r\nANDERSON DIES.", "On 27th June they were off the island of Onalaschka, and came across a\r\nparty of natives who were towing two whales they had killed;

It was at this place that he decided to winter in the Sandwich\r\nIslands, as a port in Kamtschatka would oblige his crews to remain idle\r\nfor nearly six months before further exploration to the north could be\r\nundertaken.

On the 14th Cook and Webber were at an Indian village a short distance\r\nfrom the ships, when they saw a canoe arrive containing three men and\r\naccompanied by some twenty or thirty single canoes. A tent was rigged up\r\nfor one of the first three, a Russian named Ismyloff (Ismailoff) the\r\nchief trader of the district, whilst the others made shelters of their\r\ncanoes and grass, and so all were independent of the Indians. Ismailoff\r\ninvited Cook to join him at his meal, which consisted of dried salmon and\r\nberries, and some sort of conversation was carried on by means of signs\r\nand figures. Ismailoff proved to be well acquainted with the geography of\r\nthe district, and pointed out several errors in the modern maps. He said\r\nhe had been with Lieutenant Lindo's expedition as far north as\r\nTchukotskoi Nos, and saw Clerke's Island; but when he could or would not\r\nsay what else they had done during the two years the expedition was out,\r\nCook began to have doubts. He also said the Russians had several times\r\ntried to gain a footing on the American shore, but the Indians had driven\r\nthem off with the loss of two or three of their leaders. He also spoke of\r\na sledge expedition in 1773 to three islands opposite the Kolyma River,\r\nwhich Cook thought might be the one mentioned by Muller, he related that\r\nhe had sailed, in 1771, from a Russian settlement called Bolscheretski,\r\nin the Kurile Islands, to Japan, but the ship was ordered away because\r\nthey were Christians, so they went to Canton and sailed on a French ship\r\nto France, and from thence he went to Petersburg, and was then sent out\r\nagain. He was quite clear as to his dates, and put them on paper; but as\r\nhe was perfectly ignorant of any French, \"not even the names of the\r\ncommonest articles,\" though he had been such a long time amongst French\r\npeople, Cook was again inclined to be sceptical. He stayed all night,\r\ndining with Clerke, and returned again on the 19th, with charts, which he\r\npermitted to be copied, and some manuscripts.", "sentences": ["Anchoring in Norton Sound, Cook sent away the boats to explore, and set\r\nto work to determine between the correctness of the chart drawn by\r\nStocklin and his own observations, and after a series of no less than\r\nseventy-seven sets of observations he was able to show that Stocklin was\r\nwrong.", "It was at this place that he decided to winter in the Sandwich\r\nIslands, as a port in Kamtschatka would oblige his crews to remain idle\r\nfor nearly six months before further exploration to the north could be\r\nundertaken.", "The course was now set for Samgoonoodha Harbour, but they did\r\nnot arrive there till 3rd October, having met with very heavy weather, in\r\nwhich the Resolution again began to leak badly.", "On 8th September an\r\nIndian brought a singular present in the form of a pie made like a loaf,\r\ncontaining some highly seasoned salmon, accompanied by a letter in\r\nRussian.", "In return Corporal Ledyard of the Marines, \"an intelligent man,\"\r\nwas sent with a few bottles of rum, wine, and porter, to obtain further\r\ninformation, and with orders, if he met with any Russians, he was to\r\n\"make them understand that we were English, Friends, and Allies.\" On the\r\n10th Ledyard returned, bringing three Russian sailors, but as there was\r\nno interpreter there was difficulty in understanding anything thoroughly.", "One of the newcomers was understood to say he had been out with Behring,\r\nbut Cook thought he was too young.", "They appeared to have great respect\r\nfor that officer, and Ledyard said he had seen a sloop which he\r\nunderstood was his ship.", "They stayed on the Resolution all night, and\r\npromised to return with a chart of the islands that lay between that\r\nplace and Kamtschatka.", "It was understood that there were several\r\nsettlements in the immediate neighbourhood employing altogether about\r\nfour hundred Russians.", "LETTERS TO LONDON.", "On the 14th Cook and Webber were at an Indian village a short distance\r\nfrom the ships, when they saw a canoe arrive containing three men and\r\naccompanied by some twenty or thirty single canoes.", "A tent was rigged up\r\nfor one of the first three, a Russian named Ismyloff (Ismailoff) the\r\nchief trader of the district, whilst the others made shelters of their\r\ncanoes and grass, and so all were independent of the Indians.", "Ismailoff\r\ninvited Cook to join him at his meal, which consisted of dried salmon and\r\nberries, and some sort of conversation was carried on by means of signs\r\nand figures.", "Ismailoff proved to be well acquainted with the geography of\r\nthe district, and pointed out several errors in the modern maps.", "He said\r\nhe had been with Lieutenant Lindo's expedition as far north as\r\nTchukotskoi Nos, and saw Clerke's Island; but when he could or would not\r\nsay what else they had done during the two years the expedition was out,\r\nCook began to have doubts.", "He also said the Russians had several times\r\ntried to gain a footing on the American shore, but the Indians had driven\r\nthem off with the loss of two or three of their leaders.", "He also spoke of\r\na sledge expedition in 1773 to three islands opposite the Kolyma River,\r\nwhich Cook thought might be the one mentioned by Muller, he related that\r\nhe had sailed, in 1771, from a Russian settlement called Bolscheretski,\r\nin the Kurile Islands, to Japan, but the ship was ordered away because\r\nthey were Christians, so they went to Canton and sailed on a French ship\r\nto France, and from thence he went to Petersburg, and was then sent out\r\nagain.", "He was quite clear as to his dates, and put them on paper; but as\r\nhe was perfectly ignorant of any French, \"not even the names of the\r\ncommonest articles,\" though he had been such a long time amongst French\r\npeople, Cook was again inclined to be sceptical.", "He stayed all night,\r\ndining with Clerke, and returned again on the 19th, with charts, which he\r\npermitted to be copied, and some manuscripts."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_127", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 127)", "language": "it", "content": "One chart showed the\r\nAsiatic coast as far as 41 degrees North, with the Kurile Islands and\r\nKamtschatka, and the second, the more interesting to the English, showed\r\nthe discoveries made by the Russians to the east of Kamtschatka,\r\nexclusive of the voyages of Behring and Tcherikoff. Cook found the\r\nlongitudes in places were very different from those on the Russian maps,\r\nand was afraid the mistake might be carried through, but the latitudes\r\nwere fairly correct. As far as he could ascertain, the instrument used\r\nfor the survey had been the theodolite. Before leaving, Ismailoff gave\r\nCook letters for the Governor of Kamtschatka and the Commandant of\r\nPetropaulowsk; and Cook, finding \"he was tolerably well versed in\r\nastronomy,\" gave him a Hadley's octant, and though it was the first one\r\nhe had seen, he soon made himself acquainted with its uses. A letter to\r\nthe English Admiralty was also entrusted to him to be forwarded via\r\nPetersburg, as opportunity might offer. This letter and a chart of the\r\nnorthern coasts was delivered in London the following year. On 26th October the two ships got away, and, in case of separation,\r\nClerke was given his rendezvous, first, the Sandwich Islands, and second,\r\nPetropaulowsk in the middle of May. On 28th the discovery met with a\r\nnasty accident during a gale; the fore and main tacks carried away,\r\nkilling one man, and seriously injuring the boatswain and two others. On\r\n25th November the islands were sighted, and the customary orders as to\r\nthe officers appointed to trade with the natives were issued, and no\r\ncuriosities were to be purchased before the ships had received\r\nsatisfactory supplies. They first called in at Mowee, where the natives\r\nsoon came out and appeared friendly, and traded with less suspicion than\r\nany of the South Sea Islanders they had met with before. Having procured a quantity of sugar-cane, Cook ordered it to be used in\r\nbrewing, as he found a strong decoction of the juice produced a wholesome\r\nand palatable beer, and would enable him to save the spirits for the\r\ncolder climates. However, the crews would have none of it, so Cook and\r\nhis officers made use of it whenever cane was procurable, and gave\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"no trouble either to oblige or persuade them to drink it, knowing there\r\nwas no danger of scurvy so long as we had plenty of other vegetables, but\r\nthat I might not be disappointed in my views, I gave orders that no grog\r\nshould be served in either ship.\" He then goes on to say: \"Every\r\ninnovation whatever, tho' ever so much to their advantage, is sure to\r\nmeet with the highest disapprobation from seaman. Portable soup and sour\r\nkraut were at first both condemned by them as stuff not fit for human\r\nbeings to eat. Few men have introduced into their ships more novelties in\r\nthe way of victuals and drink than I have done; indeed, few men have had\r\nthe same opportunity or been driven to the same necessity. It has,\r\nhowever, in a great measure been owing to such little innovations that I\r\nhave always kept my people, generally speaking, free from that dreadful\r\ndistemper, the Scurvy.\"\r\n\r\nThis extract shows how bitterly Cook felt the stupid ingratitude of his\r\nmen for the constant care he took of them, and is one of the very few\r\npassages in his Journals in which he speaks in their disfavour. This,\r\ncuriously, was erased by some unknown hand; King asserts it must have\r\nbeen done by Gore, as he is certain it was not by either Cook or Clerke,\r\nwho took command after Cook's death.

On 24th December they succeeded in getting to windward of the island, but\r\nthe signal to the Discovery to tack having been omitted she stood on, and\r\nit was some days before she rejoined company. January 1779 was ushered in\r\nwith heavy rain, but clearing away before noon they were able to approach\r\nto about five miles from the shore, where they lay to and traded with the\r\nnatives. The next three days were spent working slowly down the coast and\r\nkeeping a good look-out for their consort, occasionally stopping to do a\r\nlittle trading with the islanders, some of whom came as much as fifteen\r\nmiles out to them. The chief article of commerce was salt, which was of\r\nvery good quality. On the 5th January the southern point of Owhyhee was\r\nrounded, and they lay off a large village, where they were quickly\r\nsurrounded by canoes laden \"with hogs and women\": the latter are not held\r\nup as patterns of all the virtues. Vegetables seemed to be scarce, and\r\nCook concluded that either the land could not produce them, or the crops\r\nhad been destroyed by volcanic action, very recent traces of which were\r\nto be seen. \"Wednesday 6th January 1779. The next morning the people visited us\r\nagain, bringing with them the same articles as before. Being near the\r\nshore I sent Mr. Bligh, the Master, in a boat to sound the coast, with\r\norders to land and look for fresh water. On his return he reported that\r\nat two cable lengths from the shore he had no soundings with a 160\r\nfathoms of line; that when he landed he found no fresh water, but rain\r\nwater lying in holes in the rocks, and that brackish with the spray of\r\nthe sea, and that the surface of the country was wholly composed of large\r\nslags and ashes, here and there partly covered with plants. Between 10\r\nand 11 o'clock we saw the Discovery coming round the south point of the\r\nIsland and at 1 P.M. she joined us, when Captain Clerke came on board and\r\ninformed me that he had cruised four or five days where we were separated\r\nand then plyed round the last part of the Island, but meeting with\r\nunfavourable winds, was carried some distance from the coast.

In handwriting, spelling, and grammar he can compare\r\nwell with his press either in the Navy or civil life; and many of the\r\nexamples of bad spelling given have been abbreviations common in the\r\nNavy, which his critics did not understand. KARAKAKOA BAY. On 17th January they anchored in Karakakoa Bay, where large numbers of\r\ncanoes laden with provisions for sale came out; Cook estimates that at\r\none time there were no less than a thousand round the ship, their\r\noccupants entirely unarmed. They soon proved to be adepts at thieving;\r\none man stole the rudder of a boat, so Cook ordered a shot or two to be\r\nfired over the escaping thief, but \"as it was not intended that any of\r\nthe shot should take effect, the Indians seemed rather more surprised\r\nthan frightened,\" and the man got away.

AN INSECURE POSITION. The last entry made by Cook in his Ship's Journal, and probably the last\r\nwords he ever wrote, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sunday 17. Fine pleasant weather and variable faint breezes of wind. In\r\nthe evening Mr. Bligh returned and reported that he had found a bay in\r\nwhich was good anchorage and fresh water, tolerable easy to come at. Into\r\nthis bay I resolved to go to refit the ships and take in water. As the\r\nnight approached, the Indians retired to the shore, a good [many] however\r\ndesired to sleep on board, curiosity was not their only motive, at least\r\nnot with some of them, for the next morning several things were missing,\r\nwhich determined me not to entertain so many another night. At 11 A.M. anchored in the bay which is called by the natives [a blank, filled in by\r\nanother hand, Karakakoa] in 13 fathoms of water over a sandy bottom, and\r\na quarter of a mile from the North-East shore. In this situation the\r\nSouth point of the bay bore South 1/4 West, and the North point West 1/4\r\nSouth. Moored with the stream anchor to the Northward. Unbent the sails\r\nand struck yards and topmasts. The ships very much crowded with Indians\r\nand surrounded by a multitude of canoes. I have nowhere in this sea seen\r\nsuch a number of people assembled at one place, besides those in the\r\ncanoes, all the shore of the bay was covered with people and hundreds\r\nwere swimming about the ships like shoals of fish. We should have found\r\nit difficult to have kept them in order had not a chief or servant of\r\nTerreeoboo's, named Parea, now and then [shown] his authority by turning\r\nor rather driving them all out of the ship. \"Among our numerous visitors was a man named Touahah, who we soon found\r\nbelonged to the church; he introduced himself with much ceremony, in the\r\ncourse of which he presented me with a small pig, two coconuts and a\r\npiece of red cloth which he wrapped round me. In this manner all or most\r\nof the chiefs introduced themselves, but this man went further, he\r\nbrought with him a large hog and a quantity of fruits and roots, all of\r\nwhich he included in the present. In the afternoon I went ashore to view\r\nthe place accompanied by Touahah, Parea, Mr. King and others; as soon as\r\nwe landed Touahah took me by the hand and conducted me to a large Morai,\r\nthe other gentlemen with Parea, and four or five more of the natives\r\nfollowed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. King describes this Morai as being about forty yards long by twenty\r\nbroad, and about fourteen feet high, the top flat, well paved, and\r\nsurrounded by a wooden railing. An old building stood in the centre from\r\nwhich a stone wall ran to the fence dividing the top into two parts. On\r\nthe landward side were five poles upwards of twenty feet high, supporting\r\nan irregular kind of scaffold, and on the sea-side half were two small\r\nhouses with a covered communication between. On their arrival Cook was\r\npresented with two ugly images wrapped with red cloth, and a sort of hymn\r\nwas sung. Then they were marched to the scaffolding, where was a table on\r\nwhich lay fruits and vegetables surmounted by a very much decomposed pig,\r\nand in a semicircle round one end of this table were twelve images. Placing Cook near the scaffolding, Koah, as King and others call Touahah,\r\ntook up the pig and holding it towards him made a long speech. Then,\r\ndropping the offensive porker, he made signs that the two were to climb\r\non to the uncertain scaffolding.

Hogs, bread-fruit, etc., were then\r\nbrought in. Cook and Terreeoboo exchanged names as a peculiar mark of\r\nfriendship, and the ceremony ended by the presentation of the two\r\nboat-loads of provisions by a deputation of the priests.

CHAPTER 18. 1779 TO 1780. THIRD VOYAGE CONCLUDED. On 4th February the ships unmoored and sailed from the bay, steering to\r\nthe north in hopes of finding a better anchorage. The wind was very\r\nlight, and the progress was so slow that it gave Terreeoboo an\r\nopportunity of sending off a further present of food. Soon after a gale\r\nsprang up, and the canoes which had accompanied them beat a hasty\r\nretreat, leaving a good many, mostly women, on board the ships. About\r\nmidnight the fore and main topsails were split, but towards morning the\r\nwind died away and they were able to bend fresh sails. A second gale came\r\non again at night, putting them under double-reefed topsails, with\r\ntopgallant yards sent down, and at daybreak the fore-mast was found to be\r\nso badly sprung that it was absolutely necessary it should be unstepped\r\nfor immediate repairs. After considerable hesitation, for he fully\r\nrecognised that the place must be almost denuded of surplus provisions,\r\nCook decided to return to Karakakoa Bay as no other convenient place was\r\nknown, and the ships again anchored there on the 11th, starting\r\nimmediately to unstep and get the mast ashore, when it was found to be\r\nrotten at the heel as well as sprung. Wood that had been cut at Eimeo for\r\nanchor stocks was used for fishing the head, and the work proceeded\r\nrapidly: the priests making the camp tabu, so that there should be no\r\ninterference with the workmen. When the ships arrived in the bay, hardly a canoe was to be seen, and\r\nnone came out to the ships. This, contrasted with their first reception,\r\nwas the cause of some surprise, and, in view of what happened afterwards,\r\nof some suspicion; but Mr. King, who had more intercourse with the\r\nnatives than any of the other officers, was thoroughly satisfied that\r\n\"they neither meant nor apprehended any change of conduct.\" Burney says\r\nthat Terreeoboo and some of the chiefs visited them on the 12th, and\r\nasked many questions about their return, and did not seem well satisfied\r\nwith the answers received.

King\r\nsent a marine with side arms to help to restore order, but shortly after\r\nwas informed the natives were arming with stones and getting very noisy,\r\nso he went down himself, with a marine armed with his musket, and\r\nsucceeded in setting matters right. Just at this time Cook came ashore,\r\nand King reported what had occurred, receiving orders to fire with ball\r\nif he received any insolence or stones were thrown. Soon afterwards shots\r\nwere heard from the Discovery, and a canoe was seen making for the shore,\r\nclosely pursued by one of the ship's boats. Cook, King, and a marine ran\r\nto intercept them, but were too late, as the occupants of the canoe\r\nlanded before they could reach the spot. Burney says the disturbance\r\ncommenced by a native stealing a pair of carpenter's tongs, jumping\r\noverboard with them, and placing them in a canoe which at once paddled\r\noff. The thief was caught, flogged, and put in irons till the tongs were\r\nreturned from the shore.

He tried to regain possession\r\nof his canoe, but was knocked down by a sailor, and then some of the\r\nnatives, who before this had been quietly looking on, began to throw\r\nstones, and so roughly handled the sailors in the pinnace that, being\r\nunarmed, they beat a retreat, swimming to some rocks out of reach of the\r\nmissiles. Edgar and Vancouver remained ashore and fared badly, till\r\nParea, who had recovered from his blow and apparently forgotten it,\r\nordered his countrymen to stay their hands, and managed to save the\r\npinnace from being broken up. He wanted the boats to go back to the\r\nships, but as the oars had been taken away this was impossible.

Edgar wished to go to the camp to find Cook, but some of the\r\nnatives advised him to follow them and they would take him to Parea. He\r\nsoon met him carrying one oar, followed by a man with a broken one, so\r\nthey were able to make shift in the boats to the camp, being overtaken on\r\nthe way by Parea in his canoe bringing Vancouver's cap, which had been\r\nlost in the scuffle. Owing to his pursuit of the thief Cook did not hear of all this trouble\r\ntill after dark, too late to take any further steps, but King says he\r\nappeared very disturbed by the news, and remarked: \"I am afraid these\r\npeople will oblige me to use some violent measures, for they must not be\r\nleft to imagine that they have gained an advantage over us.\" He then went\r\non board his ship and ordered all natives ashore, whilst King returned to\r\nthe camp, and doubling his sentries, gave orders he was to be called if\r\nany natives were seen about. At eleven, five were seen hovering near, but\r\nwhen they found they were observed they made off, and later one got close\r\nto the observatory, but ran when the sentry fired over his head. When on\r\nhis way to the ship the next morning for the chronometer, King was\r\ninformed that the Discovery's cutter had been stolen; it had been moored\r\nto the anchor buoy. On board the Resolution he found Cook busy loading\r\nhis double-barreled gun and a landing party of marines being prepared. Cook said he was going ashore to try to gain possession of some of the\r\nprincipal chiefs in order to keep them prisoners till the boat was\r\nreturned, and that he had already sent out boats to prevent any one\r\nleaving the bay, with the intention of destroying their canoes if he\r\ncould not recover the cutter by more peaceable means. The Resolution's\r\ngreat cutter was sent after a large sailing canoe that was making off,\r\nthe small cutter was guarding the western point of the bay, and Cook,\r\nwith the pinnace and launch, were going to Kowrowa to try and get\r\nTerreeoboo on board the ship. He, and in fact every one else, were\r\nconfident the natives would offer no resistance if they heard the sound\r\nof but one musket. A little before eight o'clock Captain Cook, Lieutenant Phillips, a\r\nsergeant, corporal, and seven marines left the ship for Kowrowa, and King\r\nreturned to his camp after being ordered to try and assure the natives\r\nnear the observatory that they would not be hurt, to keep his men\r\ntogether, and to be prepared to meet any outbreak.

The two boys came forward and conducted\r\nhim to the hut where their father was, and after a short conversation he\r\nfelt assured that Terreeoboo knew nothing about the stealing of the boat. He invited the three to accompany him to the Resolution, and the king at\r\nonce consented and got up to go. However, the boys' mother came up with a\r\nfew chiefs and tried to persuade him not to go, and then they caught hold\r\nof him and forced him to sit down. Meanwhile a large crowd had gathered\r\nround, and Phillips, who seems to have acted with coolness and judgment\r\nthroughout the affair, drew up his men in line on some rocks near the\r\nwater, about thirty yards away. After trying for some time to persuade\r\nthe natives to allow their chief to go with him, Cook gave up the\r\nattempt, observing to Phillips that it would be impossible to compel them\r\nto do so without great risk of bloodshed. Unfortunately, just at this\r\ntime news arrived that a chief of the first rank had been killed at the\r\nother side of the bay. The shots had been heard soon after the landing of\r\nCook's party. It was now recognised that matters had become very serious; the natives\r\nwere seen to be donning their war mats, and one man, armed with a stone\r\nin one hand and a large iron spike in the other, threatened Cook in a\r\nvery insulting manner. He was told to keep quiet, but only became more\r\nfurious, so Cook fired a charge of small shot into him, but his mats\r\nsaved him from injury. Stones were thrown at the marines, and a chief\r\nattempted to stab Phillips, but was promptly knocked down with the butt\r\nof the latter's musket. Cook now fired his second barrel loaded with ball\r\nand killed one of the natives, but Sergeant Gibson told him it was the\r\nwrong man, so he received orders to kill the right one, and did so. The\r\nstone-throwing became heavier, and the marines responded with a volley,\r\nbut before they had time to reload the natives rushed them, killing four\r\nout of the seven and wounding the rest, Phillips being stabbed between\r\nthe shoulders, but, before the blow could be repeated he managed to shoot\r\nhis assailant. COOK'S DEATH. Cook was now close to the water's edge, and had turned round to order the\r\nboats' crews to cease firing and pull in. This is believed to have caused\r\nhis death, for, whilst he faced the natives, none of them, except the one\r\nshot by Gibson, had offered him actual violence, but when he turned to\r\ngive orders he was struck on the head and stabbed in the back, falling\r\nwith his face in a pool of water. As soon as he fell a great shout arose;\r\nhe was dragged ashore, and the natives, snatching the dagger from each\r\nother, showed savage eagerness to share in his destruction. Phillips and\r\nhis wounded marines plunged into the water and, covered by musketry fire,\r\ngained the boats; their officer, though wounded, jumping out again to the\r\nassistance of the last man who, severely injured by a blow on the face,\r\nwas in great danger of being captured. The boats, seeing there was no\r\npossibility of recovering the bodies of the five who were killed, were\r\nordered to return at once to the ships from which they had only been\r\nabsent an hour.

King, about four o'clock, was\r\nsent to try to recover the bodies of the Captain and marines. He was at\r\nfirst received with a volley of stones, which fortunately fell short; he\r\ndisplayed a white flag and pulled inshore, whilst the remaining boats lay\r\noff to cover him with their fire if needed, but the stone-throwing was\r\nstopped, and the natives also showed the white flag. In answer to King's\r\ndemand some of the chiefs promised that the bodies should be delivered\r\nthe next day, and Koah, swimming off to one of the boats, explained that\r\nthey could not be given up at once as they had already been taken some\r\ndistance up country.

During the\r\nday Koah visited the ship several times, and in vain tried to persuade\r\nClerke or King to go ashore, but it was thought inadvisable to run any\r\nfurther risks. In the evening Kerriakair and a friend came off in a small\r\ncanoe bringing a bundle containing the flesh of Cook's thighs, saying\r\nthat the body had been burned and the limbs distributed amongst the\r\nchiefs. They had brought all they could get unknown to the others, and\r\nKerriakair strongly advised Clerke not to trust too much to Koah; he said\r\nthat the inhabitants of the island were not inclined for peace except\r\nthose in the immediate neighbourhood, who would of course, in case of\r\nhostilities, be the chief sufferers. He gave the number of natives killed\r\nas twenty-six, with a large number of wounded. On the 17th the ships were warped inshore so as to command the watering\r\nplace, the launches were sent in for water, with the other boats fully\r\narmed, in support. They were received with showers of stones from the\r\nhouses, and from behind stone walls, notwithstanding guns fired from the\r\nships and musketry from the boats at any of the natives who exposed\r\nthemselves. Meanwhile Koah again visited the ships, offering a pig as a\r\npresent, and asking for someone to be sent ashore for the bodies; but he\r\nwas sent away, and was soon afterwards seen amongst the stone-throwers. In the afternoon the boats went again for water, but as the natives\r\nrecommenced hostilities they were ordered to keep clear, whilst the\r\nships' guns were worked for a quarter of an hour; then the boats' crews\r\nlanded and burned all the houses between the watering place and the\r\nMorai, killing some six or seven of the natives. In the evening, about\r\nfive o'clock, some dozen natives bearing white flags and sugar-cane\r\nmarched down to the beach headed by Kerriakair carrying a small pig. He\r\nsaid he came as an envoy from Terreeoboo to make peace, and was\r\naccordingly taken on board the Resolution. It was ascertained from him\r\nthat the boat had been stolen by some of Parea's people and had been\r\nbroken up after Cook's death. During the night some canoes came out and\r\ndid a little trading; and the next morning the bay was seen to be planted\r\nwith white flags in different directions, and the waterers were allowed\r\nto work unmolested, whilst Kerriakair asked permission, at once granted,\r\nto make an offering to one of the images on the Morai. Soon after Koah\r\ncame off with a pig, but was not admitted to either ship; he then went\r\noff to the waterers, who sent him away.

Ellis, in his Tour through Hawaii, says that King's account of Cook's\r\ndeath, from which the above has been largely drawn, agrees in a\r\nremarkable manner with that given by the natives. They in no way blamed\r\ntheir visitors for what occurred, and even after his death appear to have\r\nlooked upon Cook as a man of a superior race to themselves. His\r\nbreastbone and ribs were long preserved as relics, and in 1832 Ellis\r\nstates there were many living who remembered the occasion, and all agreed\r\nthat Cook's conduct to their countrymen was humane. Captain Clerke says:\r\n\r\n\"Upon examining the remains of my late honoured and much lamented friend,\r\nI found all his bones, excepting those of the back, jaw, and feet--the\r\ntwo latter articles Earpo brought me in the morning--the former, he\r\ndeclared, had been reduced to ashes with the trunk of the body. As\r\nCarnacare (Kerriakair) had told us, the flesh was taken from all the\r\nbones, excepting those of the hands, the skin of which they had cut\r\nthrough in many places, and salted, with the intention, no doubt, of\r\npreserving them; Earpo likewise brought with him the two barrels of\r\nCaptain Cook's gun--the one beat flat with the intention of making a\r\ncutting instrument of it; the other a good deal bent and bruised,\r\ntogether with a present of thirteen hogs from Terreaboo.\"\r\n\r\nThe hands, as has been mentioned before, were identified by the scar left\r\nby the explosion of his powder flask in Newfoundland, which almost\r\nsevered the thumb from the fingers. On 22nd February they were able to sail from this unlucky place, and\r\ntouching at one or two of the islands worked their way northwards to\r\nKamtschatka, the Resolution reaching Owatska Bay on 29th April, followed\r\nby the discovery on 1st May. They were very handsomely treated by Major\r\nBehm, the Governor of Bolcheretsk, a place about 135 miles from the town\r\nof St. Peter and St. Paul in Awatska Bay, notwithstanding Mr. Ismailoff's\r\nletters of introduction were on somewhat unsatisfactory lines. Mr. Webber\r\nwas fortunately able to converse in German, which the Russian officers\r\nunderstood; and he ascertained that Ismailoff had represented the two\r\nvessels as very small, and hinted that he believed them to be little\r\nbetter than pirates.", "sentences": ["Soon after a party of natives\r\nmarched down to the beach with bread-fruit, etc., which they left on the\r\nbeach and was afterwards taken on board.", "A chief, Eapoo, carried a\r\nmessage on board from Terreeoboo, and next day brought presents of food.", "On the 20th the foremast of the Resolution was stepped and rigging\r\ncommenced, and in the middle of the day a large body of natives marched\r\nin procession to the watering place, beating drums, yelling, carrying\r\nwhite flags, sugar-cane, etc., with Eapoo at their head bearing a parcel\r\nwrapped in cloth containing some of Cook's bones.", "He went off to the\r\nResolution with Clerke, and soon after a boat was sent ashore for a\r\npresent of food from Terreeoboo.", "The next day, with the same ceremonial,\r\nEapoo again appeared with all the remaining bones it was possible to\r\nrecover, and was this time accompanied by Karowa, Terreeoboo's youngest\r\nson.", "\"The 21st February.", "At sunset the Resolution fired ten minute guns, with\r\nthe colours half staff up, when the remains of our late Commander were\r\ncommitted to the deep.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Williamson was severely blamed by his brother officers for not\r\ngoing to the assistance of the pinnace at the time of the attack on his\r\nCaptain, and it is said that had it not been for Clerke's ill health he\r\nwould have been tried by court-martial.", "He was afterwards, when in\r\ncommand of the Agincourt, tried for \"disaffection, cowardice,\r\ndisobedience to signals, and not having done his duty in rendering all\r\nassistance possible.\" He was found guilty on the last two counts only,\r\nand was \"placed at the bottom of the list of Post-Captains, and rendered\r\nincapable of ever serving on board of any of His Majesty's ships.\"\r\n\r\nCOOK'S REMAINS.", "Ellis, in his Tour through Hawaii, says that King's account of Cook's\r\ndeath, from which the above has been largely drawn, agrees in a\r\nremarkable manner with that given by the natives.", "They in no way blamed\r\ntheir visitors for what occurred, and even after his death appear to have\r\nlooked upon Cook as a man of a superior race to themselves.", "His\r\nbreastbone and ribs were long preserved as relics, and in 1832 Ellis\r\nstates there were many living who remembered the occasion, and all agreed\r\nthat Cook's conduct to their countrymen was humane.", "Captain Clerke says:\r\n\r\n\"Upon examining the remains of my late honoured and much lamented friend,\r\nI found all his bones, excepting those of the back, jaw, and feet--the\r\ntwo latter articles Earpo brought me in the morning--the former, he\r\ndeclared, had been reduced to ashes with the trunk of the body.", "As\r\nCarnacare (Kerriakair) had told us, the flesh was taken from all the\r\nbones, excepting those of the hands, the skin of which they had cut\r\nthrough in many places, and salted, with the intention, no doubt, of\r\npreserving them; Earpo likewise brought with him the two barrels of\r\nCaptain Cook's gun--the one beat flat with the intention of making a\r\ncutting instrument of it; the other a good deal bent and bruised,\r\ntogether with a present of thirteen hogs from Terreaboo.\"\r\n\r\nThe hands, as has been mentioned before, were identified by the scar left\r\nby the explosion of his powder flask in Newfoundland, which almost\r\nsevered the thumb from the fingers.", "On 22nd February they were able to sail from this unlucky place, and\r\ntouching at one or two of the islands worked their way northwards to\r\nKamtschatka, the Resolution reaching Owatska Bay on 29th April, followed\r\nby the discovery on 1st May.", "They were very handsomely treated by Major\r\nBehm, the Governor of Bolcheretsk, a place about 135 miles from the town\r\nof St.", "Peter and St.", "Paul in Awatska Bay, notwithstanding Mr.", "Ismailoff's\r\nletters of introduction were on somewhat unsatisfactory lines.", "Mr.", "Webber\r\nwas fortunately able to converse in German, which the Russian officers\r\nunderstood; and he ascertained that Ismailoff had represented the two\r\nvessels as very small, and hinted that he believed them to be little\r\nbetter than pirates."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_137", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 137)", "language": "it", "content": "The Governor provided the ships with what he could\r\ngive them, and promised to obtain further stores from Okotsk for them\r\nagainst their return.

One return, however, they were able to\r\nmake which was of great service. At the time of the visit of the ships a\r\nlarge number of the soldiers and inhabitants were suffering very\r\nseriously from scurvy, and Clerke at once put them under the care of his\r\nmedical officers, who, by the use of sour kraut and sweet wort made from\r\nthe ship's stock of malt, soon caused \"a surprising alteration in the\r\nfigures of most of them and their speedy recovery was chiefly attributed\r\nto the effects of the sweet wort.\"\r\n\r\nThey were informed by the Major that on the day of the arrival of the\r\nEnglish party at Bolcheretsk he had received a letter from the most\r\nnortherly outpost on the Sea of Okotsk, stating that the tribe of\r\nTschutski, which had been long at feud with the Russians, had sent in an\r\nembassy offering friendship and tribute, giving as a reason that they had\r\nbeen visited by two large vessels in the preceding summer, and had been\r\nreceived on board with great kindness, and had entered into a league of\r\nfriendship with their visitors: they therefore thought it their duty to\r\nratify this treaty formally. These two ships could have been none other\r\nthan the Resolution and Discovery, though evidently the Tschutski thought\r\nthey were Russian. DEATH OF CLERKE. Leaving on 13th June, the Asiatic coast was followed up, and 1st July\r\nthey were off the Gulf of Anadyr, where fogs and ice began seriously to\r\ninterfere with their progress, so they abandoned the Asiatic for the\r\nAmerican side, but with no better luck. They reached the latitude of 70\r\ndegrees 33 minutes North, about five leagues short of the point reached\r\nthe previous year, and at length, realising further efforts were useless\r\nand resulting in serious damage to the ships from continual contact with\r\nthe loose ice, Clerke determined to return to Awatska Bay and refit and\r\nthen return to England. On 22nd August, the day before they reached the\r\nBay, Captain Clerke, who had long been suffering from serious ill health,\r\ndied, and was buried under a tree a little to the north of the post of\r\nSt. Peter and St. Paul; the crews of both ships and the Russian garrison\r\ntaking part in the funeral ceremony, and the Russian priest reading the\r\nservice at the grave. Clerke had been all three voyages with Cook, and\r\nwas only thirty-eight years of age. Gore now took command of the Resolution, Burney, Rickman, and Lanyon\r\nbeing his lieutenants, whilst King was the new Captain of the Discovery,\r\nand Williamson and Hervey his lieutenants; Bayley going with Gore in\r\ncharge of the astronomical observations. On 9th October they left Awatska\r\nand were off Cape Nambu, Japan, on the 26th, but were driven off the\r\ncoast by bad weather, and anchored in Macao Roads on 1st December. Here,\r\nafter considerable delay, stores were obtained from Canton, and the\r\nseaman managed to dispose of most of the furs they had obtained in the\r\nnorth. King estimates that the two ships received, in money and goods, as\r\nmuch as 2000 pounds for the skins, and says that the men were so anxious\r\nto return for more that they were almost in a state of mutiny. On 11th April the ships reached the Cape, where the officers were\r\ncordially received by Governor Plattenberg, who expressed the deepest\r\nregret to hear of the loss of Cook, and requested that he should be sent\r\na portrait of the Captain to place in a blank space he pointed out\r\nbetween two portraits of De Ruyter and Van Tromp--a gracious compliment.", "sentences": ["The Governor provided the ships with what he could\r\ngive them, and promised to obtain further stores from Okotsk for them\r\nagainst their return.", "For these kindnesses the English could make but\r\nlittle return, and even then it was with difficulty that the Russians\r\ncould be persuaded to receive anything, for they said they were only\r\nacting up to the wishes of their Empress, who desired all her allies\r\nshould be treated with courtesy.", "One return, however, they were able to\r\nmake which was of great service.", "At the time of the visit of the ships a\r\nlarge number of the soldiers and inhabitants were suffering very\r\nseriously from scurvy, and Clerke at once put them under the care of his\r\nmedical officers, who, by the use of sour kraut and sweet wort made from\r\nthe ship's stock of malt, soon caused \"a surprising alteration in the\r\nfigures of most of them and their speedy recovery was chiefly attributed\r\nto the effects of the sweet wort.\"\r\n\r\nThey were informed by the Major that on the day of the arrival of the\r\nEnglish party at Bolcheretsk he had received a letter from the most\r\nnortherly outpost on the Sea of Okotsk, stating that the tribe of\r\nTschutski, which had been long at feud with the Russians, had sent in an\r\nembassy offering friendship and tribute, giving as a reason that they had\r\nbeen visited by two large vessels in the preceding summer, and had been\r\nreceived on board with great kindness, and had entered into a league of\r\nfriendship with their visitors: they therefore thought it their duty to\r\nratify this treaty formally.", "These two ships could have been none other\r\nthan the Resolution and Discovery, though evidently the Tschutski thought\r\nthey were Russian.", "DEATH OF CLERKE.", "Leaving on 13th June, the Asiatic coast was followed up, and 1st July\r\nthey were off the Gulf of Anadyr, where fogs and ice began seriously to\r\ninterfere with their progress, so they abandoned the Asiatic for the\r\nAmerican side, but with no better luck.", "They reached the latitude of 70\r\ndegrees 33 minutes North, about five leagues short of the point reached\r\nthe previous year, and at length, realising further efforts were useless\r\nand resulting in serious damage to the ships from continual contact with\r\nthe loose ice, Clerke determined to return to Awatska Bay and refit and\r\nthen return to England.", "On 22nd August, the day before they reached the\r\nBay, Captain Clerke, who had long been suffering from serious ill health,\r\ndied, and was buried under a tree a little to the north of the post of\r\nSt.", "Peter and St.", "Paul; the crews of both ships and the Russian garrison\r\ntaking part in the funeral ceremony, and the Russian priest reading the\r\nservice at the grave.", "Clerke had been all three voyages with Cook, and\r\nwas only thirty-eight years of age.", "Gore now took command of the Resolution, Burney, Rickman, and Lanyon\r\nbeing his lieutenants, whilst King was the new Captain of the Discovery,\r\nand Williamson and Hervey his lieutenants; Bayley going with Gore in\r\ncharge of the astronomical observations.", "On 9th October they left Awatska\r\nand were off Cape Nambu, Japan, on the 26th, but were driven off the\r\ncoast by bad weather, and anchored in Macao Roads on 1st December.", "Here,\r\nafter considerable delay, stores were obtained from Canton, and the\r\nseaman managed to dispose of most of the furs they had obtained in the\r\nnorth.", "King estimates that the two ships received, in money and goods, as\r\nmuch as 2000 pounds for the skins, and says that the men were so anxious\r\nto return for more that they were almost in a state of mutiny.", "On 11th April the ships reached the Cape, where the officers were\r\ncordially received by Governor Plattenberg, who expressed the deepest\r\nregret to hear of the loss of Cook, and requested that he should be sent\r\na portrait of the Captain to place in a blank space he pointed out\r\nbetween two portraits of De Ruyter and Van Tromp--a gracious compliment."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Arthur Kitson"}, {"id": "txt_it_10842_138", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 138)", "language": "it", "content": "Sailing from Simon's Bay on 9th May, the trades were picked up on the\r\n14th, and on 13th June the line was crossed in longitude 26 degrees 16\r\nminutes West.

On 14th February 1781, the second anniversary of Cook's death, King,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Banks, was presented to His Majesty, who was pleased\r\nto accept the Journals of the Resolution and Discovery kept during this\r\neventful voyage. CHAPTER 19. APPRECIATION AND CHARACTER. Of course as nothing had been heard of the expedition for a considerable\r\ntime, a certain amount of anxiety was felt, which at length found vent in\r\nparagraphs in the public press, and on 11th January 1780 the London\r\nGazette contained the following:\r\n\r\n\"Captain Clerke of His Majesty's Sloop the Resolution, in a letter to Mr. Stephens, dated the 8th of June 1779, in the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul, Kampschatka, which was received yesterday, gives the melancholy\r\naccount of the celebrated Captain Cook, late Commander of that Sloop,\r\nwith four of his private Marines having been killed on the 14th of\r\nFebruary last at the island of Owhyhe, one of a Group of new-discovered\r\nIslands in the 22nd degree of North Latitude, in an affray with a\r\nnumerous and tumultuous Body of the Natives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Clerke adds, that he received every friendly supply from the\r\nRussian Government; and that as the Companies of the Resolution and her\r\nConsort, the Discovery, were in perfect Health, and the two Sloops had\r\ntwelve months Stores and Provisions on board, he was preparing to make\r\nanother Attempt to explore a Northern Passage to Europe.\"\r\n\r\nTHE EMPRESS OF RUSSIA. The London Gazette of 8th February says:\r\n\r\n\"The Empress of Russia expressed a most deep concern at the Loss of\r\nCaptain Cook. She was the more sensibly affected from her very partial\r\nregard to his merits; and when she was informed of the hospitality shown\r\nby the Russian Government at Kamschatka to Captain Clerke, she said no\r\nSubject in her Dominions could show too much Friendship to the Survivors\r\nof Captain Cook.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter written by Clerke was sent by express through Petersburg; that\r\nis to say, it was written in the extreme east of Asia in June, and was\r\nsent overland across Siberia to Petersburg, and thence via Berlin to\r\nLondon, and was there published in under the six months.

COOK'S LETTER. The Royal Society was naturally amongst the first to recognise the great\r\nworth of its late Fellow, and the loss the Society had suffered from his\r\ndeath. It had already granted him one of its highest honours in the form\r\nof the Copley Gold Medal for his successful contest with the scurvy, and\r\nit now decided to mark its appreciation by striking a special gold medal\r\nin his honour. This was forwarded by Sir Joseph Banks, President of the\r\nRoyal Society, to Mrs. Cook, and acknowledged by her in the following\r\ntouching letter:\r\n\r\nMile End,\r\n\r\n16th August 1784.

Be assured, Sir, that however unequal I may be to the task of expressing\r\nit, I feel as I ought the high honour which the Royal Society has been\r\npleased to do me. My greatest pleasure now remaining is in my sons, who,\r\nI hope, will ever strive to copy after so good an example, and, animated\r\nby the honours bestowed on their Father's memory, be ambitious of\r\nattaining by their own merits your notice and approbation.

James Cook, the Circumnavigator (Part 140)", "language": "it", "content": "Still some idea of their life together,\r\nshort as it really was, notwithstanding it lasted, in name, for over\r\nsixteen years, may be gained from the manner in which his widow always\r\nspoke of him after his death. She always wore a ring containing a lock of\r\nhis hair, and measured everything by his standard of morality and honour. The greatest disapprobation she could express was \"Mr. Cook would never\r\nhave done so.\" He was always Mr. Cook to her. She kept four days each\r\nyear as solemn fasts, remaining in her own room. The days were those on\r\nwhich she lost her husband and three sons, passing them in reading her\r\nhusband's Bible, prayer and meditation, and during bad weather she could\r\nnot sleep for thinking of those at sea. For her husband's sake she\r\nbefriended her nephews and nieces whom she never saw. Of her three sons,\r\ntwo entered the Navy. One, Nathaniel, was lost with his ship, the\r\nThunderer, in a hurricane off Jamaica in 1780. The eldest, James, rose to\r\nthe rank of Commander, and in January 1794 was appointed to H.M. sloop\r\nSpitfire. He was at Poole when he received his orders to join his ship at\r\nPortsmouth without delay. Finding an open boat with sailors returning\r\nfrom leave about to start, he joined them. It was blowing rather hard,\r\nand nothing was ever heard of the passengers or crew, except that the\r\nbroken boat and the dead body of the unfortunate young officer, stripped\r\nof all money and valuables, with a wound in the head, was found ashore on\r\nthe Isle of Wight. The third son, Hugh, was entered at Christ's College,\r\nCambridge, in 1793, but contracting scarlet fever he died on 21st\r\nDecember of that year, and was buried in the church of St. Andrew the\r\nGreat, being joined by his brother James a few weeks afterwards, when the\r\nmother was left indeed alone. She survived her husband for the long\r\nperiod of fifty-six years, living at Clapham with her cousin, Admiral\r\nIsaac Smith, and at length joined her two sons at Cambridge at the\r\nadvanced age of ninety-three. Cook's character as given by those with whom he worked, men who day after\r\nday were by his side, was a fine one. His greatest fault seems to have\r\nbeen his hasty temper, which he admitted himself, often most regretfully;\r\nbut Captain King says it was \"disarmed by a disposition the most\r\nbenevolent and humane,\" and it never was displayed in such a manner as to\r\ncause the loss of respect and affection of his people. He was healthy and\r\nvigorous in mind and body, clear-headed and cool in times of danger,\r\nbroad minded and temperate, and plain and unaffected in manner. His\r\npowers of observation were of the first rank, his knowledge of Naval\r\nmathematics far surpassed the ordinary level and amounted to genius, but,\r\nabove all, his devotion to duty was the commanding feature of his\r\ncharacter. Nothing was allowed to interfere when he saw his course before\r\nhim; personal convenience was not allowed to weigh for one moment, but at\r\nthe same time he never lost sight of the interests of those under him and\r\nspared them when possible. He was somewhat silent and reserved in manner,\r\nbut when questioned on any subject on which he felt he was an authority,\r\nhis answers were clearly and distinctly given, and his reasons disclosed\r\nhis powers of observation to the full. He was kindly, generous, and\r\nhospitable, and by no means the stern character that has been painted,\r\nfor even in such a matter-of-fact document as his official Journal, a\r\nspirit of fun occasionally gleams out. Such was the man whose name will ever stand in the very first ranks of\r\nthe British Empire Builders; honest, kindly, generous, a faithful servant\r\nand a noble leader. INDEX.
