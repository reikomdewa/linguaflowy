There, I kept to my room for three days. My mind was\r\ncontinually haunted by my loneliness and desertion, and I beat my breast,\r\nalready sore from blows. \"Why could not the earth have opened and\r\nswallowed me,\" I wailed aloud, between the many deep-drawn groans, \"or\r\nthe sea, which rages even against the guiltless?

Here, an eagle was soaring into the sky bearing the\r\nshepherd of Mount Ida to heaven; there, the comely Hylas was struggling\r\nto escape from the embrace of the lascivious Naiad. Here, too, was\r\nApollo, cursing his murderous hand and adorning his unstrung lyre with\r\nthe flower just created.

With their little hands shielding their faces,\r\n\r\nThe boys, neither thinking of self, but each one of his brother! Fraternal love's sacrifice! Death himself slew those poor children\r\n\r\nBy means of their unselfish fear for each other!

The full moon now lifted her luminous beam and the small stars\r\n\r\nLed forth, with her torch all ablaze; when the Greeks drew the bolts\r\n\r\nAnd poured forth their warriors, on Priam's sons, buried in darkness\r\n\r\nAnd sodden with wine. First the leaders made trial of their weapons\r\n\r\nJust as the horse, when unhitched from Thessalian neck-yoke,\r\n\r\nFirst tosses his head and his mane, ere to pasture he rushes. They draw their swords, brandish their shields and rush into the battle. One slays the wine-drunken Trojans, prolonging their dreams\r\n\r\nTo death, which ends all. Still another takes brands from the altars,\r\n\r\nAnd calls upon Troy's sacred temples to fight against Trojans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE NINTIETH.

Seeing what was in the wind,\r\nGiton slipped out of the room, pretending he was going after water, and\r\nby this diplomatic retreat he put an end to my fury. Then, as my anger\r\ncooled, little by little, \"Eumolpus,\" I said, \"rather than have you\r\nentertain designs of such a nature, I would even prefer to have you\r\nspouting poetry! I am hot-tempered and you are lecherous; see how\r\nuncongenial two such dispositions must be! Take me for a maniac, humor\r\nmy malady: in other words, get out quick!\"  Taken completely aback by\r\nthis onslaught, Eumolpus crossed the threshold of the room without\r\nstopping to ask the reason for my wrath, and immediately slammed the door\r\nshut, penning me in, as I was not looking for any move of that kind then,\r\nhaving quickly removed the key, he hurried away in search of Giton. Finding that I was locked in, I decided to hang myself, and had already\r\nfastened my belt to the bedstead which stood alongside of the wall, and\r\nwas engaged in fastening the noose around my neck, when the doors were\r\nunlocked and Eumolpus came in with Giton, recalling me to light when I\r\nwas just about to turn the fatal goal-post! Giton was greatly wrought up\r\nand his grief turned to fury: seizing me with both hands, he threw me\r\nupon the bed. \"If you think, Encolpius,\" he shrieked, \"that you can\r\ncontrive to die before I do, you're wrong! I thought of suicide first. I hunted for a sword in Ascyltos' house: I would have thrown myself from\r\na precipice if I had not found you! You know that Death is never far\r\nfrom those who seek him, so take your turn and witness the spectacle you\r\nwished to see!\"  So saying, he snatched a razor from Eumolpus' servant,\r\nslashed his throat, once, twice, and fell down at our feet! I uttered a\r\nloud cry, rushed to him as he fell, and sought the road to death by the\r\nsame steel; Giton, however, showed not the faintest trace of any wound,\r\nnor was I conscious of feeling any pain. The razor, it turned out, was\r\nuntempered and dull and was used to imbue boy apprentices with the\r\nconfidence of the experienced barber. Hence it was in a sheath and, for\r\nthe reason given above, the servant was not alarmed when the blade was\r\nsnatched nor did Eumolpus break in upon this farcical death scene. CHAPTER THE NINETY-FIFTH. The landlord made his appearance with a part of our little supper, while\r\nthis lover's comedy was being enacted and, taking in the very disorderly\r\nspectacle which we presented, lying there and wallowing as we were,\r\n\"Are you drunk,\" he demanded, \"or are you runaway slaves, or both? Who turned up that bed there? What's the meaning of all  these sneaking\r\npreparations? You didn't want to pay the room-rent, you didn't, by\r\nHercules, you didn't; you wanted to wait till night and run away into the\r\npublic streets, but that won't go here! This is no widow's joint, I'll\r\nshow you that; not yet it ain't! This place belongs  to Marcus\r\nManicius!\"  \"So you threaten, do you'?\"  yelled Eumolpus, giving the\r\nfellow a resounding slap in the face. At this, the latter threw a small\r\nearthenware pitcher, which had been emptied by the draughts of successive\r\nguests, at Eumolpus' head, and cut open the forehead of his cursing\r\nadversary: then he skipped out of the room. Infuriated at such an\r\ninsult, Eumolpus snatched up a wooden candlestick, ran in pursuit of his\r\nretreating foeman, and avenged his broken head with a shower of blows. The entire household crowded around, as did a number of drunken lodgers,\r\nbut I seized this opportunity of retaliating and locked Eumolpus out,\r\nretorting his own trick upon the quarrelsome fellow, and found myself\r\nwithout a rival, as it were, able to enjoy my room and my night's\r\npleasure as well.", "sentences": ["Nor can Encolpius take offense, he loves\r\nanother.\"  The soldier who took my sword from me did Eumolpus a good\r\nturn, too;

see how\r\nuncongenial two such dispositions must be!", "Take me for a maniac, humor\r\nmy malady: in other words, get out quick!\"  Taken completely aback by\r\nthis onslaught, Eumolpus crossed the threshold of the room without\r\nstopping to ask the reason for my wrath, and immediately slammed the door\r\nshut, penning me in, as I was not looking for any move of that kind then,\r\nhaving quickly removed the key, he hurried away in search of Giton.", "Finding that I was locked in, I decided to hang myself, and had already\r\nfastened my belt to the bedstead which stood alongside of the wall, and\r\nwas engaged in fastening the noose around my neck, when the doors were\r\nunlocked and Eumolpus came in with Giton, recalling me to light when I\r\nwas just about to turn the fatal goal-post!", "Giton was greatly wrought up\r\nand his grief turned to fury: seizing me with both hands, he threw me\r\nupon the bed.", "\"If you think, Encolpius,\" he shrieked, \"that you can\r\ncontrive to die before I do, you're wrong!", "I thought of suicide first.", "I hunted for a sword in Ascyltos' house: I would have thrown myself from\r\na precipice if I had not found you!", "You know that Death is never far\r\nfrom those who seek him, so take your turn and witness the spectacle you\r\nwished to see!\"  So saying, he snatched a razor from Eumolpus' servant,\r\nslashed his throat, once, twice, and fell down at our feet!", "I uttered a\r\nloud cry, rushed to him as he fell, and sought the road to death by the\r\nsame steel; Giton, however, showed not the faintest trace of any wound,\r\nnor was I conscious of feeling any pain.", "The razor, it turned out, was\r\nuntempered and dull and was used to imbue boy apprentices with the\r\nconfidence of the experienced barber.", "Hence it was in a sheath and, for\r\nthe reason given above, the servant was not alarmed when the blade was\r\nsnatched nor did Eumolpus break in upon this farcical death scene.", "CHAPTER THE NINETY-FIFTH.", "The landlord made his appearance with a part of our little supper, while\r\nthis lover's comedy was being enacted and, taking in the very disorderly\r\nspectacle which we presented, lying there and wallowing as we were,\r\n\"Are you drunk,\" he demanded, \"or are you runaway slaves, or both?", "Who turned up that bed there?", "What's the meaning of all  these sneaking\r\npreparations?", "You didn't want to pay the room-rent, you didn't, by\r\nHercules, you didn't;

Eumolpus was speaking privately with Bargates, when a crier attended by a\r\npublic slave entered the inn, accompanied by a medium-sized crowd of\r\noutsiders.

These apples were always counted, and about\r\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\r\nof them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\r\ngardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\r\neldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in\r\nthe morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\r\nordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\r\nanother apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\r\nthe gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\r\nto him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\r\nunder the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\r\nnoise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\r\nit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son\r\njumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\r\nonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.

but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in\r\nthe morning another of the apples was missing.", "Then the second son was\r\nordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\r\nanother apple was gone.", "Then the third son offered to keep watch;

and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\r\nother, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\r\nthere, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\r\nto be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can\r\nsuch a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at\r\nthe fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\r\nran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\r\nthe village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\r\nsinging, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\r\nand poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby\r\nhouse, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,\r\nand ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too. Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\r\nwere heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\r\nto him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\r\nto the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\r\nthe merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\r\nwithstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\r\nhis country in the same manner. Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\r\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\r\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\r\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\r\ncoming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\r\nnot rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\r\nthe same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\r\nattempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my\r\ntail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to\r\nrun, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\r\nwhistled in the wind. When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and\r\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\r\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\r\nwas beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come\r\nto a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\r\nsnoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\r\non till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\r\nclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\r\nbird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\r\nyou will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\r\nyoung man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\r\ntheir hair whistled in the wind. Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\r\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\r\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\r\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a\r\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so\r\nhe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage. But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\r\nthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning\r\nthe court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\r\ndie, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\r\nswiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\r\ngiven him for his own. So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\r\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now\r\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel.", "sentences": ["You will reach a village in the\r\nevening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\r\nother, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\r\nthere, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\r\nto be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can\r\nsuch a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at\r\nthe fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\r\nran into the wood.", "Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\r\nthe village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\r\nsinging, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\r\nand poor.", "‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby\r\nhouse, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,\r\nand ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.", "Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\r\nwere heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\r\nto him.", "He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\r\nto the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\r\nthe merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\r\nwithstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\r\nhis country in the same manner.", "Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\r\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\r\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\r\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\r\ncoming back.", "However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\r\nnot rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\r\nthe same good counsel.", "But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\r\nattempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my\r\ntail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to\r\nrun, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\r\nwhistled in the wind.", "When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and\r\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\r\nnight at his ease.", "In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\r\nwas beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come\r\nto a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\r\nsnoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\r\non till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\r\nclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\r\nbird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\r\nyou will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\r\nyoung man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\r\ntheir hair whistled in the wind.", "Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\r\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\r\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\r\nlost were lying close by it.", "Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a\r\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so\r\nhe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.", "But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\r\nthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king.", "The next morning\r\nthe court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\r\ndie, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\r\nswiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\r\ngiven him for his own.", "So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\r\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now\r\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_3", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 3)", "language": "de", "content": "I will\r\nstill, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\r\nI bid you.

ransom no one from the gallows,\r\nand sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’\r\nthought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’\r\n\r\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\r\nhe had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and\r\nuproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men\r\nare going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\r\nhis brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any\r\nway be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his\r\nmoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to\r\nthink about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\r\ngiven up, and went on with him towards their home. And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\r\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the\r\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,\r\n‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\r\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\r\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\r\nhome to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our\r\nlabour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\r\neat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept. The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was\r\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\r\nthat he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,\r\nand scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\r\nhave befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\r\nof my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\r\nto him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill\r\nyou, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor\r\nman, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the\r\ndoors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\r\nleft off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his\r\nbrothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\r\nprincess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to\r\nhis kingdom. A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\r\nmet him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\r\noff his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\r\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\r\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years. HANS IN LUCK\r\n\r\n\r\nSome men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\r\nright--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\r\nswans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\r\nwill always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\r\nmuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\r\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it\r\nknow about the matter? One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\r\nworked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I\r\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\r\nand let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good\r\nservant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump\r\nof silver as big as his head. Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\r\nthrew it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards.", "sentences": ["Then the fox\r\ncame, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the\r\nyoung man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give\r\nyou good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\r\nand sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went.", "‘Well,’\r\nthought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’\r\n\r\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\r\nhe had left his two brothers.", "And there he heard a great noise and\r\nuproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men\r\nare going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\r\nhis brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any\r\nway be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his\r\nmoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty.", "Then he did not stay to\r\nthink about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\r\ngiven up, and went on with him towards their home.", "And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\r\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the\r\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,\r\n‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\r\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\r\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\r\nhome to the king their master, and said.", "‘All this have we won by our\r\nlabour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\r\neat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.", "The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was\r\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\r\nthat he could find no way to get out.", "Then the old fox came once more,\r\nand scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\r\nhave befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\r\nof my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\r\nto him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill\r\nyou, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor\r\nman, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the\r\ndoors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\r\nleft off weeping.", "Then he went to the king, and told him all his\r\nbrothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\r\nprincess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to\r\nhis kingdom.", "A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\r\nmet him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\r\noff his head and feet.", "And at last he did so, and in a moment the\r\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\r\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.", "HANS IN LUCK\r\n\r\n\r\nSome men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\r\nright--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\r\nswans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\r\nwill always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\r\nmuch the faster.", "The world may very likely not always think of them as\r\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world?", "what can it\r\nknow about the matter?", "One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans.", "Seven long years he had\r\nworked hard for his master.", "At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I\r\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\r\nand let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good\r\nservant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump\r\nof silver as big as his head.", "Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\r\nthrew it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_5", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 5)", "language": "de", "content": "As he\r\nwent lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\r\ntrotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a\r\nfine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy\r\nas if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\r\nstones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did\r\nnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,\r\nfriend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to\r\ncarry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up\r\nmy head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say\r\nof making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse,\r\nand you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\r\ntrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my\r\nheart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\r\nthing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’\r\nHowever, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\r\nthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When\r\nyou want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\r\n“Jip!”’\r\n\r\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\r\nelbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\r\nminute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\r\n\r\n ‘No care and no sorrow,\r\n  A fig for the morrow! We’ll laugh and be merry,\r\n  Sing neigh down derry!’\r\n\r\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\r\nsmacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and\r\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\r\nback by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\r\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\r\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\r\nshepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\r\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\r\nhis neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\r\ndeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\r\nspoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\r\nnot very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that\r\ncow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\r\ninto the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said\r\nthe shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\r\nhorse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\r\nmyself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart that good man\r\nhas!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\r\nand the cow good morning, and away he rode. Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\r\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\r\none. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\r\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\r\nit; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\r\ncan I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\r\nbread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had\r\nrested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s\r\nvillage. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\r\nlast, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\r\nan hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\r\nclave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought\r\nhe; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the\r\nstump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\r\nwas to be had.", "sentences": ["As he\r\nwent lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\r\ntrotting gaily along on a capital horse.", "‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a\r\nfine thing it is to ride on horseback!", "There he sits as easy and happy\r\nas if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\r\nstones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did\r\nnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,\r\nfriend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to\r\ncarry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up\r\nmy head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say\r\nof making an exchange?’ said the horseman.", "‘I will give you my horse,\r\nand you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\r\ntrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my\r\nheart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\r\nthing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’\r\nHowever, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\r\nthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When\r\nyou want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\r\n“Jip!”’\r\n\r\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\r\nelbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\r\nminute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\r\n\r\n ‘No care and no sorrow,\r\n  A fig for the morrow!", "We’ll laugh and be merry,\r\n  Sing neigh down derry!’\r\n\r\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\r\nsmacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and\r\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\r\nback by the road-side.", "His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\r\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it.", "Hans soon came to\r\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\r\nshepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\r\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\r\nhis neck.", "However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\r\ndeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\r\nspoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\r\nnot very like a nosegay.", "One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that\r\ncow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\r\ninto the bargain.", "What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said\r\nthe shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\r\nhorse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\r\nmyself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily.", "‘What a noble heart that good man\r\nhas!’ thought he.", "Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\r\nand the cow good morning, and away he rode.", "Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\r\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\r\none.", "‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\r\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\r\nit; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\r\ncan I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\r\nbread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer.", "When he had\r\nrested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s\r\nvillage.", "But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\r\nlast, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\r\nan hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\r\nclave to the roof of his mouth.", "‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought\r\nhe; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the\r\nstump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\r\nwas to be had."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_6", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 6)", "language": "de", "content": "Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\r\nhim milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had\r\nnot thought of looking to that. While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\r\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\r\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\r\nlay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\r\npig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the\r\nbutcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he\r\nwas dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then\r\nthe butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh\r\nyourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old\r\nbeast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said\r\nHans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and\r\ngive me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate\r\ncow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like\r\nthat fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\r\nsomething with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said\r\nthe butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\r\nneighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\r\npig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’\r\nsaid Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\r\nwheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\r\nits leg. So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\r\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all. How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\r\nlast got? The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\r\ncountryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;\r\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\r\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then\r\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\r\nchristening. ‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\r\nweeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\r\nit has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in\r\nhis hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the\r\ncountryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he,\r\n‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing\r\nyou a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I\r\njust came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\r\ndreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If\r\nyou have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least\r\nthey will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?’\r\n\r\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out\r\nof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\r\nbut he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this\r\ncountry better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought\r\nto have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat\r\ngoose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\r\nthat. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then\r\nhe took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\r\nwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’\r\nthought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig\r\nit is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I\r\nhave much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;\r\nthen the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\r\nare all the beautiful white feathers.", "sentences": ["Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\r\nhim milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry?", "Hans had\r\nnot thought of looking to that.", "While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\r\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\r\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\r\nlay a long while senseless.", "Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\r\npig in a wheelbarrow.", "‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the\r\nbutcher, as he helped him up.", "Hans told him what had happened, how he\r\nwas dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too.", "Then\r\nthe butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh\r\nyourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old\r\nbeast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said\r\nHans, ‘who would have thought it?", "What a shame to take my horse, and\r\ngive me only a dry cow!", "If I kill her, what will she be good for?", "I hate\r\ncow-beef; it is not tender enough for me.", "If it were a pig now--like\r\nthat fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\r\nsomething with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said\r\nthe butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\r\nneighbourly thing.", "To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\r\npig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’\r\nsaid Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\r\nwheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\r\nits leg.", "So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\r\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.", "How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\r\nlast got?", "The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose.", "The\r\ncountryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;\r\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\r\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him.", "The countryman then\r\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\r\nchristening.", "‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\r\nweeks old.", "Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\r\nit has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in\r\nhis hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the\r\ncountryman began to look grave, and shook his head.", "‘Hark ye!’ said he,\r\n‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing\r\nyou a kind turn.", "Your pig may get you into a scrape.", "In the village I\r\njust came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty.", "I was\r\ndreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig.", "If\r\nyou have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you.", "The least\r\nthey will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond.", "Can you swim?’\r\n\r\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened.", "‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out\r\nof this scrape.", "I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\r\nbut he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this\r\ncountry better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought\r\nto have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat\r\ngoose for a pig, indeed!", "‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\r\nthat.", "However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then\r\nhe took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\r\nwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care.", "‘After all,’\r\nthought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in.", "I don’t care whose pig\r\nit is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me.", "I\r\nhave much the best of the bargain.", "First there will be a capital roast;\r\nthen the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\r\nare all the beautiful white feathers."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_7", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 7)", "language": "de", "content": "I will put them into my pillow,\r\nand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my\r\nmother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.’\r\n\r\nAs he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\r\nworking and singing,\r\n\r\n ‘O’er hill and o’er dale\r\n  So happy I roam,\r\n  Work light and live well,\r\n  All the world is my home;\r\n  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’\r\n\r\nHans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well\r\noff, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the\r\nother, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\r\ninto his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\r\nbeautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where\r\ndid you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a\r\nhorse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my\r\nhead for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh! I worked hard for that seven long\r\nyears.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder,\r\n‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\r\nin it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be\r\nmanaged?’ ‘How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other;\r\n‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one\r\nthat is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\r\nvalue of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said\r\nHans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\r\nwhenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there’s\r\nthe goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\r\nthat lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\r\nenough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’\r\n\r\nHans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\r\nsparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born\r\nin a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself. People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\r\nletting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’\r\n\r\nMeantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\r\nlast penny in his joy at getting the cow. At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\r\ndragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\r\nwater, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\r\nthe bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\r\nlittle, and down it rolled, plump into the stream. For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\r\nup and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\r\nwith tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\r\nthe ugly heavy stone. ‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he\r\ngot with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\r\nhe reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to\r\ngood luck was. JORINDA AND JORINDEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\r\nwood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take\r\nany shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of\r\nan owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\r\nbecame an old woman again.

One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\r\nalone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near\r\nto the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\r\nsetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\r\nthe green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\r\nbirches. Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\r\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\r\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when\r\nthey looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\r\nat a loss to know what path to take. The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\r\nthe hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\r\nbushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\r\nwalls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled. Jorinda was just singing,\r\n\r\n ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\r\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day! He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,\r\n  Well-a-day!’\r\n\r\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\r\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\r\nwith a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\r\nround them, and three times screamed:\r\n\r\n ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’\r\n\r\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\r\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;\r\nthe gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\r\nold fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\r\nchin that almost met one another. She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\r\nwith it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\r\nwhat could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\r\nwhere he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n ‘Till the prisoner is fast,\r\n  And her doom is cast,\r\n  There stay! Oh, stay! When the charm is around her,\r\n  And the spell has bound her,\r\n  Hie away! away!’\r\n\r\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\r\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\r\nshe laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\r\nwent her way. He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what\r\nwill become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\r\na strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time\r\ndid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\r\nbut all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda. At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\r\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\r\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\r\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\r\nfound his Jorinda again. In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\r\nthis pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\r\non the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\r\nflower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\r\npearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\r\nnight, till he came again to the castle. He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\r\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this.

They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\r\nroad and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,\r\n‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’\r\nsaid the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in\r\ndanger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\r\nease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\r\nlaid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\r\nenough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’\r\n‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are\r\na good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat\r\nwas pleased with the thought, and joined the party. Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\r\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main. ‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\r\nis all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that\r\nwe should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\r\nthe cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\r\nhead tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\r\non Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master\r\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\r\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\r\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my\r\nheart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.

Finding everything still, he\r\nmarched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\r\norder to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\r\nthe cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\r\nlight it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\r\nand spat, and scratched at him.

Your master,\r\nyou know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\r\nfield; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\r\nbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work.

The wolf ran with the\r\nchild a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\r\nsoon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\r\nand mistress.

The boar, however, had not quite hidden\r\nhimself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\r\nthem a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\r\nmouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\r\nup and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there\r\nsits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf\r\nsitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\r\nand would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\r\nhimself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan. THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\r\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and\r\nthat it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\r\nobserving it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\r\na burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw\r\nbegan and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal\r\nreplied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\r\nby sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\r\nburnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,\r\nbut if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\r\ninto broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better\r\nfate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has\r\ndestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\r\nonce, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’\r\n\r\n‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal. ‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped\r\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\r\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\r\nrepair to a foreign country.’\r\n\r\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\r\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\r\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\r\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight\r\nacross, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw\r\ntherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\r\nwho was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\r\nnewly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\r\nwater rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\r\nand ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\r\ntwo pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed\r\nwhen she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had\r\nprudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\r\nwas unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would\r\nhave been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\r\nwas travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\r\nand sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\r\ntailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.", "sentences": ["The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\r\nespied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing\r\nstraight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\r\nfight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\r\na stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\r\nfighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\r\nup into a tree.", "Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\r\nwondered that no one was there.", "The boar, however, had not quite hidden\r\nhimself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\r\nthem a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\r\nmouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\r\nup and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there\r\nsits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf\r\nsitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\r\nand would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\r\nhimself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.", "THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\r\nof beans and wanted to cook them.", "So she made a fire on her hearth, and\r\nthat it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.", "When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\r\nobserving it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\r\na burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two.", "Then the straw\r\nbegan and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal\r\nreplied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\r\nby sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\r\nburnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,\r\nbut if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\r\ninto broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better\r\nfate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw.", "‘The old woman has\r\ndestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\r\nonce, and took their lives.", "I luckily slipped through her fingers.’\r\n\r\n‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.", "‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped\r\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\r\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\r\nrepair to a foreign country.’\r\n\r\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\r\ntogether.", "Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\r\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\r\nit.", "The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight\r\nacross, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw\r\ntherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\r\nwho was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\r\nnewly-built bridge.", "But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\r\nwater rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\r\nand ventured no farther.", "The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\r\ntwo pieces, and fell into the stream.", "The coal slipped after her, hissed\r\nwhen she got into the water, and breathed her last.", "The bean, who had\r\nprudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\r\nwas unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst.", "It would\r\nhave been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\r\nwas travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.", "As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\r\nand sewed her together.", "The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\r\ntailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_13", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 13)", "language": "de", "content": "BRIAR ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\r\nwhere there were in those days fairies.

But one day as the queen was walking\r\nby the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\r\nlittle fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\r\nand nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little\r\nfish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\r\nit lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,\r\nand it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\r\nsoon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to\r\npass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\r\ncould not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\r\nfeast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked\r\nhis kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours.

One gave her goodness, another\r\nbeauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\r\nworld. Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\r\nthe courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\r\ncome, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\r\nbroomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall. Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\r\nscolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\r\nrevenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\r\nyear, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of\r\nthe friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\r\nsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\r\nmischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle\r\nwounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\r\nhundred years. However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\r\nthe threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\r\nshould be bought up and burnt.

But\r\nthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\r\nRose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to\r\ntime, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\r\ninto the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\r\nthorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\r\nthey stuck fast, and died wretchedly. After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an\r\nold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\r\npalace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\r\nlay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard\r\nfrom his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\r\nbreak through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\r\ndied. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I\r\nwill go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but\r\nhe was bent upon going. Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\r\nto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\r\nwhich he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\r\nasleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\r\nthe pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he\r\ncame into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\r\nwas standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\r\nto drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\r\nplucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\r\nif she was going to beat the boy. Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\r\nevery breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\r\nthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\r\nfast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\r\ncould not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss. But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\r\nupon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\r\nawoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder. And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\r\npigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\r\nflew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\r\nthe kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\r\nwith the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\r\ndraught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl;

THE DOG AND THE SPARROW\r\n\r\n\r\nA shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\r\nsuffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he\r\ntook to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,\r\nmy friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have\r\nnothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me\r\ninto the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they\r\nwent together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,\r\nthe sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you\r\ndown a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\r\nfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\r\npecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\r\ntill at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\r\naway with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said\r\nthe sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\r\nthe next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had\r\neaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you\r\nhad enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should\r\nlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’\r\nsaid the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him\r\nto a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\r\nthey fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\r\nanother shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the\r\nsparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and\r\nnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went\r\nout upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\r\nfar before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a\r\nnap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime\r\nI will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the\r\nroad, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\r\na cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The\r\nsparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\r\ngo on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\r\nout, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the\r\ncarter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed! what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\r\ndog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the\r\nsparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\r\nmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’\r\n‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’\r\nand passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\r\npecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\r\nall the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked\r\nround, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty. ‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\r\nthe sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\r\npecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,\r\nhe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\r\nher; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head\r\nwith such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’\r\ncried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow.

The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\r\ncried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and\r\nblind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\r\ncleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\r\nand his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\r\nglasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\r\ntouching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the\r\nwife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting\r\nher off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\r\nher.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\r\nand cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he\r\ncould wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,\r\nstrike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but\r\nshe missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\r\ndead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest. THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\r\ntwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\r\nshut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\r\nworn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\r\ncould find out how it happened, or where they had been. Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\r\ndiscover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\r\ndanced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\r\nwife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\r\nsucceed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.

But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and\r\nwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\r\ndancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing\r\nhappened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\r\ncut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\r\nand all lost their lives in the same manner. Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\r\nand could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\r\nreigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\r\nwho asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or\r\nwhat I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very\r\nwell to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\r\nI might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard\r\ntask: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\r\nprincesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\r\nyou pretend to be fast asleep.’\r\n\r\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on\r\nyou will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\r\nprincesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good\r\ncounsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\r\nhe was willing to undertake the task. He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\r\nfine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\r\nto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\r\nthe princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\r\naway secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\r\ndown on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\r\nhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\r\nheartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser\r\nthing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened\r\ntheir drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\r\ndressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\r\nto begin dancing.

‘never is a long\r\ntime.", "I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\r\nthink I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife!", "why should you wish to\r\nbe emperor?’ said the fisherman.", "‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!", "I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish\r\ncannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\r\nsuch a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go\r\nat once!’\r\n\r\nSo the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\r\n‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\r\ntired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He\r\nsoon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\r\na mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\r\nwent as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘O man of the sea!", "Hearken to me!", "My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r\n\r\n‘What would she have now?’ said the fish.", "‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,\r\n‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish;

Our parents are\r\nhonest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’\r\n\r\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\r\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\r\nwhen their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as\r\ntouch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\r\nsettled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\r\nhere and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall\r\nbe punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and\r\ncalled in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\r\nsuffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was\r\nannounced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\r\npart in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\r\ncontained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\r\nair, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\r\nflies had to come.

When I lift\r\nmy tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\r\nlet it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard\r\nthat, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\r\ndetail, to the willow-wren.

The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\r\nthe air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\r\nwas uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\r\nother.

When the fox felt\r\nthe first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\r\nhe bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\r\nsting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\r\nhold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs.

After a time she threw it up so high that\r\nshe missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\r\nalong upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\r\nprincess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\r\ndeep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail\r\nher loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would\r\ngive all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\r\nworld.’\r\n\r\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\r\n‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you\r\ndo for me, you nasty frog?

He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\r\nhe may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\r\nshall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will\r\nbring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head\r\ndown, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\r\nup again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\r\nspring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\r\nit up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\r\nnever thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could. The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\r\nsaid,’ But she did not stop to hear a word. The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\r\nstrange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\r\nmarble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\r\ndoor, and a little voice cried out and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!

and after a little while he came\r\nup again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\r\nspring.", "As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\r\nit up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\r\nnever thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.", "The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\r\nsaid,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.", "The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\r\nstrange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\r\nmarble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\r\ndoor, and a little voice cried out and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!", "And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r\n\r\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\r\nthe frog, whom she had quite forgotten.", "At this sight she was sadly\r\nfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\r\nseat.", "The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\r\nasked her what was the matter.", "‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at\r\nthe door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\r\ntold him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\r\nget out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\r\nin.’\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!", "And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r\n\r\nThen the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word\r\nyou must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped\r\ninto the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\r\nbottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\r\nthe princess sat."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_24", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 24)", "language": "de", "content": "‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,\r\n‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog\r\nsaid, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This\r\nshe did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am\r\ntired;

CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\r\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\r\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. ‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\r\nfrom hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture\r\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice\r\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\r\nto put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no\r\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\r\ndares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\r\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was\r\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\r\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,\r\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\r\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\r\nhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\r\nafter the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all\r\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\r\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,\r\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\r\nbe godmother.", "sentences": ["‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,\r\n‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog\r\nsaid, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This\r\nshe did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am\r\ntired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,\r\nthough very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\r\npillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long.", "As soon as it was\r\nlight he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.", "‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be\r\ntroubled with him no more.’\r\n\r\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\r\ntapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!", "And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r\n\r\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\r\nher pillow as before, till the morning broke.", "And the third night he did\r\nthe same.", "But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\r\nastonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\r\nwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\r\nof her bed.", "He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\r\nchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\r\nsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\r\nher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights.", "‘You,’ said the\r\nprince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\r\nbut that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will\r\nmarry you, and love you as long as you live.’\r\n\r\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to\r\nall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\r\nhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\r\nthe coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\r\nthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\r\nbitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.", "They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\r\nhorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s\r\nkingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\r\nmany years.", "CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\r\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\r\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.", "‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\r\nfrom hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture\r\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice\r\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\r\nto put it.", "At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no\r\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\r\ndares take anything away from there.", "We will set it beneath the altar,\r\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was\r\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\r\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,\r\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\r\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\r\nhim over the font at the christening.", "Let me go out today, and you look\r\nafter the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all\r\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me.", "I\r\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,\r\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\r\nbe godmother."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_25", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 25)", "language": "de", "content": "She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\r\nbegan to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\r\nwalk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\r\nstretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\r\nof the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home. ‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a\r\nmerry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they\r\ngive the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried\r\nthe mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\r\nyour family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse\r\nthan Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’\r\n\r\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning.

When\r\nshe went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’\r\n‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I\r\nnever heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the\r\ncalendar!’\r\n\r\nThe cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good\r\nthings go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again. The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\r\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\r\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off! Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me\r\nvery thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey\r\nfur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because\r\nyou do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse\r\ncleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\r\nemptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some\r\npeace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\r\nhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\r\nthe third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the\r\ncat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the\r\nmost suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\r\nwhat can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\r\ndown to sleep. From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\r\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\r\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,\r\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\r\nshall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much\r\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\r\nwindow.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\r\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the\r\nmouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\r\nfriend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\r\ntop off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the\r\ncat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on\r\nthe poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\r\non her, seized her, and swallowed her down.

When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\r\ngreat way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\r\ngot ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her\r\nmother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\r\nsilver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\r\nroyal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\r\nher into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,\r\nand could speak. When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\r\nbed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\r\nand gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for\r\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took\r\na sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\r\nher bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\r\nbridegroom’s kingdom. One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\r\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch\r\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\r\ndrink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\r\nstoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\r\nlonger.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\r\nlittle brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\r\nher golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’\r\nAnd the lock answered her, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r\n\r\nBut the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\r\nmaid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again. Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\r\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\r\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude\r\nspeech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\r\nmy golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\r\nthan before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’\r\nThen the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\r\ndown, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\r\n‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:\r\n\r\n ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r\n\r\nAnd as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\r\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did\r\nnot see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\r\ncharm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\r\nshe had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would\r\nhave got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,\r\nand you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her\r\nhorse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\r\nmaid’s shabby ones. At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\r\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\r\nhappened.

So Chanticleer began to build a little\r\ncarriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\r\nit and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\r\nhome. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;\r\nI had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,\r\nif you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came\r\nquacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have\r\nyou in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon\r\nthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no\r\ncoward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\r\nthat she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\r\nupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she\r\nagreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,\r\nduck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good\r\npace. After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\r\nwalking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’\r\nand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\r\ndirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\r\nfriend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\r\ndrinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\r\nthat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\r\ncarriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\r\nlikely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\r\npromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\r\ntread on Partlet’s toes. Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\r\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\r\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\r\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\r\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\r\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\r\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\r\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\r\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily. Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\r\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\r\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\r\nfireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\r\nand seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair\r\nand the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\r\naway as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open\r\nair in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\r\nclose by the inn, soon swam out of their reach. An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\r\nto wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\r\nwalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\r\nstirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him. ‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my\r\nhead this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\r\neasy chair; but, oh dear!

HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\r\n\r\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\r\nso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\r\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\r\nand away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where\r\nare you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,\r\n\r\n ‘All on our way\r\n  A visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r\n\r\nThen the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my\r\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’\r\n\r\n ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\r\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!

When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice\r\ndrew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\r\nupon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\r\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\r\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\r\nup in the towel. When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\r\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\r\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\r\nwhen he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\r\nover his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his\r\nsupper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\r\nhis cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\r\nrun out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\r\ndown on his head, and killed him on the spot. 3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\r\n\r\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\r\nto eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\r\nshould be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large\r\nnut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\r\nherself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\r\nstuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\r\nChanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\r\nshall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\r\nsaid, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\r\nwill be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,\r\nand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to\r\nthe bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\r\nthe river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\r\nlies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride\r\nsaid, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\r\nin the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\r\nfrom the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\r\nthe bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\r\nthe river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\r\nPartlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\r\nquite dead, and never moved any more. Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\r\ncame and wept with him over poor Partlet.", "sentences": ["He now flew into a very great passion, and,\r\nsuspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\r\nafter them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\r\nwould take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\r\nreckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.", "2.", "HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\r\n\r\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\r\nso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\r\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\r\nand away they drove.", "Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where\r\nare you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,\r\n\r\n ‘All on our way\r\n  A visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r\n\r\nThen the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my\r\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’\r\n\r\n ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\r\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!", "Now, mice, be ready,\r\n  And, wheels, run steady!", "For we are going a visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r\n\r\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\r\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\r\nthem.", "When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice\r\ndrew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\r\nupon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\r\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\r\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\r\nup in the towel.", "When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\r\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\r\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\r\nwhen he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\r\nover his face and eyes.", "Then he was very angry, and went without his\r\nsupper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\r\nhis cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\r\nrun out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\r\ndown on his head, and killed him on the spot.", "3.", "HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\r\n\r\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\r\nto eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\r\nshould be shared equally between them.", "Now Partlet found a very large\r\nnut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\r\nherself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\r\nstuck in her throat.", "Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\r\nChanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\r\nshall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\r\nsaid, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\r\nwill be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,\r\nand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to\r\nthe bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\r\nthe river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\r\nlies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride\r\nsaid, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\r\nin the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\r\nfrom the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\r\nthe bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\r\nthe river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\r\nPartlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\r\nquite dead, and never moved any more.", "Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\r\ncame and wept with him over poor Partlet."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_31", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 31)", "language": "de", "content": "And six mice built a little\r\nhearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\r\nthemselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them.

So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get\r\nover?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,\r\nand you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the\r\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\r\nand were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came\r\nand said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\r\nshall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed\r\nso clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\r\nstream.

RAPUNZEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\r\nchild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which\r\na splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\r\nflowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\r\none dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\r\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was\r\nstanding by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\r\nbed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\r\nlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\r\nand began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and\r\nasked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat\r\nsome of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\r\ndie.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,\r\nbring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’\r\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\r\nenchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\r\nwife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It\r\ntasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\r\nthree times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband\r\nmust once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\r\ntherefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\r\nwall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\r\nhim. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my\r\ngarden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’\r\n‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\r\nup my mind to do it out of necessity.", "sentences": ["And six mice built a little\r\nhearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\r\nthemselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them.", "On the way they\r\nmet the fox.", "‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he.", "‘To bury my\r\nPartlet,’ said the other.", "‘May I go with you?’ said the fox.", "‘Yes; but\r\nyou must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then\r\nthe fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\r\nall the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.", "So on they went till they came to a rapid stream.", "‘How shall we get\r\nover?’ said Chanticleer.", "Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,\r\nand you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the\r\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\r\nand were drowned.", "What was to be done?", "Then a large log of wood came\r\nand said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\r\nshall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed\r\nso clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\r\nstream.", "Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\r\noffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\r\nand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\r\nmanaged to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\r\nwho were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\r\nand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.", "Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\r\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.", "Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\r\ndied too; and so all were dead.", "RAPUNZEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\r\nchild.", "At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.", "These people had a little window at the back of their house from which\r\na splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\r\nflowers and herbs.", "It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\r\none dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\r\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world.", "One day the woman was\r\nstanding by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\r\nbed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\r\nlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\r\nand began to look pale and miserable.", "Then her husband was alarmed, and\r\nasked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat\r\nsome of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\r\ndie.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,\r\nbring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’\r\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\r\nenchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\r\nwife.", "She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.", "It\r\ntasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\r\nthree times as much as before.", "If he was to have any rest, her husband\r\nmust once more descend into the garden.", "In the gloom of evening\r\ntherefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\r\nwall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\r\nhim.", "‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my\r\ngarden and steal my rampion like a thief?", "You shall suffer for it!’\r\n‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\r\nup my mind to do it out of necessity."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_32", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 32)", "language": "de", "content": "My wife saw your rampion from the\r\nwindow, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\r\nhad not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\r\nsoftened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow\r\nyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\r\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\r\nthe world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\r\nmother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\r\nwoman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\r\nchild the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her. Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\r\ntwelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\r\na forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\r\nlittle window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\r\nbeneath it and cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.’\r\n\r\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\r\nheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\r\nwound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\r\nfell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it. After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through\r\nthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\r\ncharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\r\nsolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king’s\r\nson wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\r\nbut none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\r\ntouched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\r\nlistened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\r\nthat an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.’\r\n\r\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\r\nclimbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\r\nwill try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow\r\ndark, he went to the tower and cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.’\r\n\r\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up. At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\r\nhad never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to\r\nher quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\r\nthat it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\r\nhim for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\r\nthought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said\r\nyes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with\r\nyou, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk\r\nevery time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\r\nthat is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They\r\nagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\r\nold woman came by day.

The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\r\n‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He\r\ntook it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\r\none, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\r\nhad carried it away.

He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\r\nat length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\r\nounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\r\nconsequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\r\nwhat he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam\r\nshall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health\r\nand strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\r\na piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t\r\ntaste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I\r\ntake a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\r\nbigger and bigger stitches.", "sentences": ["Then she was terribly\r\nalarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the\r\nforester comes home and sees that the children are gone?", "They must be\r\nfollowed instantly to get them back again.’\r\n\r\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\r\novertake the children.", "The children, however, were sitting outside the\r\nforest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\r\nsaid to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’\r\nFundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become\r\na rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to\r\nthe forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\r\nthe children were nowhere.", "Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done\r\nhere,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\r\nin the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it.", "Then the\r\nold cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the\r\nrose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\r\nyou;

The flies, however,\r\nwho understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\r\nagain in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all\r\npatience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\r\nand saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on\r\nthem. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\r\nthan seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that\r\nsort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole\r\ntown shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\r\na girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at\r\none stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear\r\nof it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The tailor\r\nput on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\r\nthought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,\r\nhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\r\ntake with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\r\nhe put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which\r\nhad caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the\r\ncheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\r\nhe felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\r\nreached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\r\npeacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\r\nand said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\r\nwide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck. Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously\r\nat the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\r\nshowed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I\r\nam!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had\r\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\r\nfor the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\r\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\r\nof it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is\r\nthat all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his\r\nhand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\r\nthe liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,\r\nwasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\r\nof the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\r\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do\r\nthat likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone\r\ncame down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\r\nback at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\r\nand threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,\r\nrose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you,\r\ncomrade?’ asked the tailor.", "sentences": ["In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\r\nrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\r\nattracted and descended on it in hosts.", "‘Hi!", "who invited you?’ said the\r\nlittle tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away.", "The flies, however,\r\nwho understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\r\nagain in ever-increasing companies.", "The little tailor at last lost all\r\npatience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\r\nand saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on\r\nthem.", "When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\r\nthan seven, dead and with legs stretched out.", "‘Are you a fellow of that\r\nsort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery.", "‘The whole\r\ntown shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\r\na girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at\r\none stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear\r\nof it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail.", "The tailor\r\nput on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\r\nthought his workshop was too small for his valour.", "Before he went away,\r\nhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\r\ntake with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\r\nhe put in his pocket.", "In front of the door he observed a bird which\r\nhad caught itself in the thicket.", "It had to go into his pocket with the\r\ncheese.", "Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\r\nhe felt no fatigue.", "The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\r\nreached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\r\npeacefully about him.", "The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\r\nand said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\r\nwide-spread world!", "I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.", "Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously\r\nat the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin!", "You miserable creature!’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\r\nshowed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I\r\nam!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had\r\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\r\nfor the tiny fellow.", "Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\r\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\r\nof it.", "‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is\r\nthat all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his\r\nhand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\r\nthe liquid ran out of it.", "‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,\r\nwasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\r\nof the little man.", "Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\r\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it.", "‘Now, little mite of a man, do\r\nthat likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone\r\ncame down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\r\nback at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\r\nand threw it into the air.", "The bird, delighted with its liberty,\r\nrose, flew away and did not come back.", "‘How does that shot please you,\r\ncomrade?’ asked the tailor."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_36", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 36)", "language": "de", "content": "‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant,\r\n‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He\r\ntook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\r\nthe ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\r\ntree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you\r\nthe trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\r\nafter all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his\r\nshoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\r\ncould not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\r\ntailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\r\nwhistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if\r\ncarrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the\r\nheavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark\r\nyou, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,\r\nseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\r\nto the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\r\nthe tree!’\r\n\r\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\r\nhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\r\ndown, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\r\ntailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\r\nit sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it. When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is\r\nthis? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no\r\nlack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could\r\nbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over\r\nthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he\r\ncould not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\r\nthat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand. The giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\r\ncavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and\r\nfollowed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\r\nthere by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\r\nwas eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much\r\nmore spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and\r\nsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too\r\nbig for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\r\na corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\r\ntailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\r\ncut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\r\ngrasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\r\nforest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\r\nwalked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,\r\nthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\r\ngreat hurry. The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose. After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\r\npalace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\r\nread on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does\r\nthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty\r\nlord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\r\nopinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\r\nman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart.

The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\r\nhim a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said\r\namong themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\r\nseven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\r\nhim.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\r\nthe king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’ said\r\nthey, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was\r\nsorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\r\nwished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\r\nhave been rid of him again.

For a long time the giant felt nothing,\r\nbut at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you\r\nknocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking\r\nyou.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\r\nthrew a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried\r\nthe other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered\r\nthe first, growling.

The other paid him back in\r\nthe same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\r\nbelaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\r\nthe ground at the same time.

They tore up trees in their sore need, and\r\ndefended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\r\nlike myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not\r\nwounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about\r\nthat,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The\r\nhorsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\r\nfound the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\r\ntorn-up trees. The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\r\nrepented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\r\nrid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\r\nkingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed. In\r\nthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\r\nit first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one\r\nblow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went\r\nforth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\r\nwait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards\r\nhim, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\r\nhorn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as\r\nthat,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\r\nclose, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against\r\nthe tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\r\nthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\r\nwas caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out\r\nfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\r\naxe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\r\nbeast away and took it to the king. The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\r\ndemand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\r\nmade great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\r\nhelp. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not\r\ntake the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\r\nthat he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\r\nsuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When\r\nthe boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\r\nwhetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\r\nfled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\r\nonce, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor\r\nran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\r\nbeast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\r\nwas caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\r\nmight see the prisoner with their own eyes.

I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one\r\nunicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\r\noutside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\r\nwere overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\r\nbehind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\r\nhim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\r\nlife. HANSEL AND GRETEL\r\n\r\n\r\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\r\ntwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\r\nlittle to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\r\nland, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\r\nover this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\r\ngroaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we\r\nto feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\r\nourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early\r\ntomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\r\nit is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\r\nof them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\r\nleave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\r\nrid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I\r\nbear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\r\nsoon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we\r\nmust all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\r\ncoffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very\r\nsorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man. The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\r\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\r\nbitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,\r\nGretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\r\nto help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\r\non his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\r\nshone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\r\nglittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\r\nlittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went\r\nback and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\r\npeace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed.

Then they all set out together\r\non the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\r\nstood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\r\nbehind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,\r\nfather,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is\r\nsitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:\r\n‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\r\nshining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\r\nthe cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\r\nout of his pocket on the road. When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,\r\nchildren, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\r\nbe cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\r\nlittle hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\r\nvery high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\r\nfire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood.

It was not the axe, however, but\r\na branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\r\nblowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\r\ntime, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\r\nat last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and\r\nsaid: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted\r\nher and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\r\nwill soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\r\nhis little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\r\nnewly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\r\nto their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\r\nopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty\r\nchildren, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\r\nnever coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\r\nhim to the heart to leave them behind alone. Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\r\nland, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\r\nfather: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\r\nis the end.

He who says A must say B, likewise,\r\nand as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\r\nalso. The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\r\nnever in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\r\nthe mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\r\nyou may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\r\nthe evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When\r\nit was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\r\nscattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\r\nno one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\r\nnight, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,\r\nGretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\r\nwhich I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When\r\nthe moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\r\nthousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\r\nthem all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but\r\nthey did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\r\ntoo from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\r\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\r\nberries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\r\nlegs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\r\nasleep. It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They\r\nbegan to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\r\nhelp did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\r\nwas mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\r\nwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\r\nwhen its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\r\nand they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\r\nwhich it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\r\nthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\r\nwere of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and\r\nhave a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\r\nsome of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and\r\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\r\nagainst the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\r\nfrom the parlour:\r\n\r\n ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\r\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?’\r\n\r\nThe children answered:\r\n\r\n ‘The wind, the wind,\r\n  The heaven-born wind,’\r\n\r\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\r\ntaste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\r\nthe whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\r\nit. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\r\nsupported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\r\nso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\r\nhands.

When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\r\nwas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,\r\nGretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,\r\nhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\r\nand how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she\r\ncried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\r\nat any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’\r\nsaid the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\r\nthe water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,\r\n‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor\r\nGretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. ‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that\r\nwe can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\r\nshut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.

THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\r\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\r\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\r\nconsiderably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the\r\nwood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\r\nto the cooking. When people are too well off they always begin to long for something\r\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\r\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\r\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\r\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\r\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire\r\nand fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\r\nuntil it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the\r\npot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\r\ndinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\r\namong the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\r\nand salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and\r\nhad laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\r\nfinished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\r\nmorning: and that was really a very delightful life. Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\r\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\r\nand had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\r\nchange, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray\r\nas the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\r\nmaster of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\r\ndrew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\r\nto cook, and to the bird to fetch the water. And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\r\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\r\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\r\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\r\nflew out to meet him.", "sentences": ["‘But now we must\r\nbe off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\r\nwater.", "‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no\r\nbridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white\r\nduck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\r\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?", "There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\r\n  Take us across on thy back so white.’\r\n\r\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\r\nhis sister to sit by him.", "‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy\r\nfor the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The\r\ngood little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\r\nwalked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\r\nto them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house.", "Then\r\nthey began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\r\ntheir father’s neck.", "The man had not known one happy hour since he had\r\nleft the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead.", "Gretel\r\nemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\r\nroom, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\r\nadd to them.", "Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\r\nin perfect happiness.", "My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\r\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.", "THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\r\npartnership and set up house together.", "For a long time all went well;\r\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\r\nconsiderably to their stores.", "The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the\r\nwood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\r\nto the cooking.", "When people are too well off they always begin to long for something\r\nnew.", "And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\r\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\r\nhousehold arrangements.", "But the other bird sneered at him for being a\r\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\r\nat home and had a good time of it.", "For, when the mouse had made the fire\r\nand fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\r\nuntil it was time to set the table.", "The sausage had only to watch the\r\npot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\r\ndinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\r\namong the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\r\nand salted, and ready to be served.", "Then, when the bird came home and\r\nhad laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\r\nfinished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\r\nmorning: and that was really a very delightful life.", "Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\r\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\r\nand had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\r\nchange, and to try some other way of arranging the work.", "Beg and pray\r\nas the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\r\nmaster of the situation, and the venture had to be made.", "They therefore\r\ndrew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\r\nto cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.", "And now what happened?", "The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\r\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\r\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day.", "But the\r\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\r\nflew out to meet him."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_44", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 44)", "language": "de", "content": "He had not flown far, however, when he came across\r\na dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\r\nbooty, and so seized and swallowed him.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\r\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\r\nbest of things and to remain with one another.

MOTHER HOLLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\r\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\r\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\r\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\r\nto do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\r\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\r\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\r\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\r\nstopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\r\nof her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her\r\nmisfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\r\nher a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall\r\ninto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’\r\n\r\nThe girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\r\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle. She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\r\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\r\nin every direction. She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven\r\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us\r\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\r\nago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out. She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,\r\nare ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\r\nher like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\r\napple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\r\nheap and walked on again. The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\r\nwoman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\r\nturned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you\r\nafraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\r\nproperly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\r\nhowever, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\r\nit thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\r\nin the world, that it is snowing;

So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\r\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\r\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\r\nwas homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\r\nHolle than with her mother and sister.

The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\r\nworld close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\r\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:\r\n\r\n ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo! Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’\r\n\r\nThen she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\r\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\r\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\r\ngreat riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\r\nand try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well\r\nand spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\r\nthorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\r\nshe threw it into the well, and jumped in herself. Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\r\ntill she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall\r\nbe burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves\r\nas before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty\r\nmy hands for you?’ and walked on.

But she only answered, ‘A nice\r\nthing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and\r\npassed on. At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about\r\nthe large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\r\nherself without delay to the old woman. The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\r\nto please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\r\nreturn.

So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\r\nand told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\r\nthought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,\r\nas she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\r\nthrough, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\r\npouring over her. ‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut\r\nthe gate.

LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\r\nwho looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\r\nnothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\r\nlittle cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\r\nwear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’\r\n\r\nOne day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\r\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\r\nand weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and\r\nwhen you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\r\nor you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\r\nget nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good\r\nmorning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’\r\n\r\n‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\r\nher hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\r\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\r\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\r\nhim. ‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he. ‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’\r\n\r\n‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’\r\n\r\n‘To my grandmother’s.’\r\n\r\n‘What have you got in your apron?’\r\n\r\n‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\r\nhave something good, to make her stronger.’\r\n\r\n‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’\r\n\r\n‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\r\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\r\nsurely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap. The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice\r\nplump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\r\nact craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by\r\nthe side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how\r\npretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,\r\ntoo, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\r\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\r\nout here in the wood is merry.’\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\r\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\r\nshe thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\r\nplease her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\r\nin good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\r\nflowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\r\nstill prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\r\ndeeper into the wood. Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked\r\nat the door. ‘Who is there?’\r\n\r\n‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open\r\nthe door.’\r\n\r\n‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot\r\nget up.’\r\n\r\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\r\nword he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then\r\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\r\nand drew the curtains. Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\r\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\r\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her. She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\r\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\r\nherself: ‘Oh dear!", "sentences": ["Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’\r\n\r\nBut, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\r\nher as long as she lived.", "LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\r\nwho looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\r\nnothing that she would not have given to the child.", "Once she gave her a\r\nlittle cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\r\nwear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’\r\n\r\nOne day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\r\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\r\nand weak, and they will do her good.", "Set out before it gets hot, and\r\nwhen you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\r\nor you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\r\nget nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good\r\nmorning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’\r\n\r\n‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\r\nher hand on it.", "The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\r\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her.", "Red-Cap\r\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\r\nhim.", "‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.", "‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’\r\n\r\n‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’\r\n\r\n‘To my grandmother’s.’\r\n\r\n‘What have you got in your apron?’\r\n\r\n‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\r\nhave something good, to make her stronger.’\r\n\r\n‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’\r\n\r\n‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\r\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\r\nsurely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.", "The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature!", "what a nice\r\nplump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.", "I must\r\nact craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by\r\nthe side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how\r\npretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round?", "I believe,\r\ntoo, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\r\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\r\nout here in the wood is merry.’\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\r\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\r\nshe thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\r\nplease her too.", "It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\r\nin good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\r\nflowers.", "And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\r\nstill prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\r\ndeeper into the wood.", "Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked\r\nat the door.", "‘Who is there?’\r\n\r\n‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf.", "‘She is bringing cake and wine; open\r\nthe door.’\r\n\r\n‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot\r\nget up.’\r\n\r\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\r\nword he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her.", "Then\r\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\r\nand drew the curtains.", "Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\r\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\r\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.", "She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\r\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\r\nherself: ‘Oh dear!"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_47", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 47)", "language": "de", "content": "how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\r\nbeing with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but\r\nreceived no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\r\nlooking very strange. ‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’\r\n\r\n‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply. ‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said. ‘The better to see you with, my dear.’\r\n\r\n‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’\r\n\r\n‘The better to hug you with.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’\r\n\r\n‘The better to eat you with!’\r\n\r\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\r\nbed and swallowed up Red-Cap. When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\r\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\r\nthe house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must\r\njust see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he\r\ncame to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you\r\nhere, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as\r\nhe was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\r\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\r\nnot fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\r\nof the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little\r\nRed-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\r\nsprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was\r\ninside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\r\nalso, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\r\ngreat stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,\r\nhe wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\r\nonce, and fell dead. Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and\r\nwent home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\r\nRed-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As\r\nlong as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\r\nwood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\r\ngrandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\r\npath. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\r\nher way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\r\nhad said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\r\nthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\r\nhave eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door,\r\nthat he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\r\n‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\r\nsome cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\r\nstole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\r\nintending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\r\nsteal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother\r\nsaw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone\r\ntrough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\r\nsausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\r\ntrough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full.

He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who\r\ncomes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\r\nhe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\r\nwhich to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\r\nnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband. She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\r\nnor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You\r\nhave not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\r\ntime.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is\r\nout there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by\r\nsaying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed\r\nonly replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\r\ninvited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\r\nwill strew ashes along the path.’\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\r\ndread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\r\nbe able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\r\nlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\r\nentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\r\nshe followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\r\nstep she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\r\ndarkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so\r\ngrim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped\r\ninside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\r\nthroughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\r\ncage on the wall. Again it cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r\n\r\nThe girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\r\nall empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,\r\nand there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\r\nshaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband\r\nlives here?’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to\r\ncome to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,\r\nand that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\r\nyou will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron\r\nof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have\r\nyou in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\r\nyou, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save\r\nyou, you would be lost.’\r\n\r\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\r\nfrom view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,\r\nor it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\r\nall asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\r\nopportunity to escape.’\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\r\ndragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\r\npaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,\r\nthree glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\r\nand with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her\r\ndainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\r\npieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.

‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\r\never so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\r\nhappy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\r\npass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\r\nhad wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\r\nquite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So\r\nthey said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\r\nlittle as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas\r\nThumb. They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\r\nbigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born. Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\r\nbe a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about. One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\r\nfuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\r\nwant to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;\r\nthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman\r\nlaughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s\r\nbridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only\r\nharness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\r\ngo.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’\r\n\r\nWhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\r\nTom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\r\nto go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse\r\nwent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\r\nwood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\r\nwas calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd\r\nthing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a\r\ncarter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,\r\nindeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it\r\ngoes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\r\nplace where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\r\nout, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take\r\nme down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\r\nthe other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a\r\nstraw, where he sat as merry as you please. The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\r\nto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That\r\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\r\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to\r\nthe woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He\r\nwill be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell\r\nhim at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\r\nthan all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the\r\nbargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder\r\nand whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;\r\nI’ll soon come back to you.’\r\n\r\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\r\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to\r\nsit?’ said one of them.", "sentences": ["TOM THUMB\r\n\r\n\r\nA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\r\nfireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning.", "‘How lonely it is,\r\nwife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me\r\nto sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\r\nus while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’\r\n‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round\r\nher wheel;

and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\r\nto go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse\r\nwent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\r\nwood.", "It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\r\nwas calling out, ‘Gently!", "gently!’ two strangers came up.", "‘What an odd\r\nthing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a\r\ncarter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,\r\nindeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it\r\ngoes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\r\nplace where the woodman was.", "Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\r\nout, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe!", "now take\r\nme down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\r\nthe other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a\r\nstraw, where he sat as merry as you please.", "The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\r\nto say for wonder.", "At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That\r\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\r\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to\r\nthe woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man.", "‘He\r\nwill be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell\r\nhim at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\r\nthan all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the\r\nbargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder\r\nand whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;\r\nI’ll soon come back to you.’\r\n\r\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\r\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price.", "‘Where would you like to\r\nsit?’ said one of them."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_51", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 51)", "language": "de", "content": "‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat;

They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\r\nsaid, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and\r\nput him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\r\nroad.

RUMPELSTILTSKIN\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\r\nof water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was\r\nclose by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter. She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\r\nof her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\r\nhunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now\r\nthis king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast\r\nhis greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\r\nhim. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\r\nheap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must\r\nbe spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain\r\nthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\r\nfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\r\ndoor was locked, and she was left alone. She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\r\nfate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\r\nhobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\r\nweeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and\r\nI know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it\r\nfor you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,\r\nand sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\r\n\r\n ‘Round about, round about,\r\n    Lo and behold! Reel away, reel away,\r\n    Straw into gold!’\r\n\r\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\r\nthe straw was all spun into gold. When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\r\nbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\r\nmiller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\r\nand sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\r\nsaid, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’\r\nsaid she.

The fowls began to turn brown, and were\r\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out\r\nto her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\r\nfrom the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\r\nthe moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run\r\nmyself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,\r\nGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing\r\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\r\nwhen they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\r\ndrink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’\r\nand took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\r\nnot be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught. Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\r\nand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\r\nGretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’\r\nShe touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It\r\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\r\ntime!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\r\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\r\n‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’\r\nSo she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\r\nthought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\r\nsomething is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and\r\nlooked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\r\nher: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\r\nsomewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\r\nbeen cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\r\neaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’\r\nSo she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\r\none chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\r\nand still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\r\n‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s\r\nright for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\r\nanother draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty\r\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first. While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry\r\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will\r\nsoon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that\r\nthe table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\r\ngoing to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently\r\nthe guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door. Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\r\nshe put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly\r\nas you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\r\ncertainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\r\ntwo ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest\r\nheard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\r\ncould. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\r\n‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by\r\nthat?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just\r\ngoing to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a\r\nnice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had\r\nbut left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to\r\nhim to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear.", "sentences": ["She killed two fowls, scalded them,\r\nplucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\r\nthe fire, that they might roast.", "The fowls began to turn brown, and were\r\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived.", "Then Gretel called out\r\nto her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\r\nfrom the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\r\nthe moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run\r\nmyself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,\r\nGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing\r\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\r\nwhen they will come?", "Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\r\ndrink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’\r\nand took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\r\nnot be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.", "Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\r\nand drove the spit merrily round.", "But as the roast meat smelt so good,\r\nGretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’\r\nShe touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah!", "how good fowls are!", "It\r\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\r\ntime!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\r\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\r\n‘One of the wings is burning!", "I had better take it off and eat it.’\r\nSo she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\r\nthought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\r\nsomething is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and\r\nlooked for her master, and did not see him.", "It suddenly occurred to\r\nher: ‘Who knows?", "They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\r\nsomewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\r\nbeen cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\r\neaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’\r\nSo she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\r\none chicken in great glee.", "When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\r\nand still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\r\n‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s\r\nright for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\r\nanother draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty\r\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first.", "While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry\r\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will\r\nsoon serve up,’ answered Gretel.", "Meantime the master looked to see that\r\nthe table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\r\ngoing to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps.", "Presently\r\nthe guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.", "Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\r\nshe put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush!", "hush!", "go away as quickly\r\nas you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\r\ncertainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\r\ntwo ears.", "Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest\r\nheard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\r\ncould.", "Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\r\n‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel?", "What do you mean by\r\nthat?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just\r\ngoing to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a\r\nnice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens.", "‘If he had\r\nbut left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to\r\nhim to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2591_56", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "Grimms' Fairy Tales (Part 56)", "language": "de", "content": "Then he ran after him\r\nwith the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning\r\nthat the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both.

THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\r\nof hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\r\nhold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\r\nout of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so\r\nthe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\r\nand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\r\nof it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\r\ntears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\r\nfell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said\r\nnothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\r\nhalf-pence, out of which he had to eat. They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\r\nbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are\r\nyou doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’\r\nanswered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’\r\n\r\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\r\nbegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\r\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\r\ndid spill a little of anything. THE LITTLE PEASANT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\r\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He\r\nhad not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\r\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\r\n‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\r\nmake us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\r\nother, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman\r\nalso liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\r\nthe calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\r\nhanging down as if it were eating. Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\r\ncalled the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,\r\nbut it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All\r\nright,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\r\nit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\r\nwhich was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,\r\njust look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the\r\nherd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat\r\nyour fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you\r\nhome again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and\r\nwaited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\r\nthe village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\r\ncow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating.

The\r\nmiller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay\r\nyourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.

After this the miller saw the skin\r\nin which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you\r\nthere?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can\r\nhe foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered\r\nthe peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\r\nhimself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something\r\nfor once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked\r\nand made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The\r\npeasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine\r\nhidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there\r\nand found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he.

FREDERICK AND CATHERINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\r\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said. ‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\r\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’\r\n‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew\r\nnigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\r\nput it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to\r\ncrackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\r\nthen she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\r\nto the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a\r\nlarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran\r\ninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her\r\nhead, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\r\nthat’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\r\nthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\r\nit. Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\r\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what\r\ncan’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;\r\nand as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\r\nto cool herself. Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\r\nthe cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\r\nthe cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\r\nhappened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from\r\nseeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last\r\nremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\r\nand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\r\nnicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have\r\nnow a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set\r\nit down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\r\nall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah! well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she\r\nstrewed the", "sentences": ["Have you come out of the\r\nwater?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,\r\nuntil at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\r\nbarrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\r\nof lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\r\nme.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,\r\n‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that\r\nthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\r\nmayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just\r\nthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\r\nare called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\r\nthe peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor\r\npressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and\r\nif things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash!", "went\r\nthe water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\r\nplunged in after him as one man.", "Then the entire village was dead, and\r\nthe small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.", "FREDERICK AND CATHERINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\r\nCatherine, and they had not long been married.", "One day Frederick said.", "‘Kate!", "I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\r\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’\r\n‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew\r\nnigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\r\nput it on the fire to fry.", "The steak soon began to look brown, and to\r\ncrackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\r\nthen she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\r\nto the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a\r\nlarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask.", "The beer ran\r\ninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on.", "At last it popped into her\r\nhead, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\r\nthat’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\r\nthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\r\nit.", "Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\r\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak.", "‘It’s all gone, and “what\r\ncan’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine.", "So she turned round;\r\nand as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\r\nto cool herself.", "Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\r\nthe cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\r\nthe cask was empty.", "When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\r\nhappened.", "‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from\r\nseeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last\r\nremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\r\nand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\r\nnicely.", "‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal!", "we have\r\nnow a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set\r\nit down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\r\nall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also.", "‘Ah!", "well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she\r\nstrewed the"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Jacob Grimm"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_1", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 1)", "language": "de", "content": "Produced by Martin Adamson.

I received from\r\nthem a welcome quite different to that which I had expected. The\r\nGeneral eyed me coldly, greeted me in rather haughty fashion, and\r\ndismissed me to pay my respects to his sister. It was clear that from\r\n_somewhere_ money had been acquired. I thought I could even detect a\r\ncertain shamefacedness in the General’s glance. Maria Philipovna, too,\r\nseemed distraught, and conversed with me with an air of detachment. Nevertheless, she took the money which I handed to her, counted it, and\r\nlistened to what I had to tell. To luncheon there were expected that\r\nday a Monsieur Mezentsov, a French lady, and an Englishman; for,\r\nwhenever money was in hand, a banquet in Muscovite style was always\r\ngiven. Polina Alexandrovna, on seeing me, inquired why I had been so\r\nlong away. Then, without waiting for an answer, she departed. Evidently\r\nthis was not mere accident, and I felt that I must throw some light\r\nupon matters. It was high time that I did so. I was assigned a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel (for you\r\nmust know that I belonged to the General’s suite). So far as I could\r\nsee, the party had already gained some notoriety in the place, which\r\nhad come to look upon the General as a Russian nobleman of great\r\nwealth. Indeed, even before luncheon he charged me, among other things,\r\nto get two thousand-franc notes changed for him at the hotel counter,\r\nwhich put us in a position to be thought millionaires at all events for\r\na week! Later, I was about to take Mischa and Nadia for a walk when a\r\nsummons reached me from the staircase that I must attend the General. He began by deigning to inquire of me where I was going to take the\r\nchildren; and as he did so, I could see that he failed to look me in\r\nthe eyes. He _wanted_ to do so, but each time was met by me with such a\r\nfixed, disrespectful stare that he desisted in confusion. In pompous\r\nlanguage, however, which jumbled one sentence into another, and at\r\nlength grew disconnected, he gave me to understand that I was to lead\r\nthe children altogether away from the Casino, and out into the park. Finally his anger exploded, and he added sharply:\r\n\r\n“I suppose you would like to take them to the Casino to play roulette? Well, excuse my speaking so plainly, but I know how addicted you are to\r\ngambling. Though I am not your mentor, nor wish to be, at least I have\r\na right to require that you shall not actually _compromise_ me.”\r\n\r\n“I have no money for gambling,” I quietly replied. “But you will soon be in receipt of some,” retorted the General,\r\nreddening a little as he dived into his writing desk and applied\r\nhimself to a memorandum book. From it he saw that he had 120 roubles of\r\nmine in his keeping. “Let us calculate,” he went on. “We must translate these roubles into\r\nthalers. Here—take 100 thalers, as a round sum. The rest will be safe\r\nin my hands.”\r\n\r\nIn silence I took the money. “You must not be offended at what I say,” he continued. “You are too\r\ntouchy about these things. What I have said I have said merely as a\r\nwarning. To do so is no more than my right.”\r\n\r\nWhen returning home with the children before luncheon, I met a\r\ncavalcade of our party riding to view some ruins. Two splendid\r\ncarriages, magnificently horsed, with Mlle. Blanche, Maria Philipovna,\r\nand Polina Alexandrovna in one of them, and the Frenchman, the\r\nEnglishman, and the General in attendance on horseback!", "sentences": ["Produced by Martin Adamson.", "HTML version by Al Haines.", "The Gambler\r\n\r\nby Fyodor Dostoyevsky\r\n\r\nTranslated by C.", "J.", "Hogarth\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n Chapter I\r\n Chapter II\r\n Chapter III\r\n Chapter IV\r\n Chapter V\r\n Chapter VI\r\n Chapter VII\r\n Chapter VIII\r\n Chapter IX\r\n Chapter X\r\n Chapter XI\r\n Chapter XII\r\n Chapter XIII\r\n Chapter XIV\r\n Chapter XV\r\n Chapter XVI\r\n Chapter XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length I returned from two weeks leave of absence to find that my\r\npatrons had arrived three days ago in Roulettenberg.", "I received from\r\nthem a welcome quite different to that which I had expected.", "The\r\nGeneral eyed me coldly, greeted me in rather haughty fashion, and\r\ndismissed me to pay my respects to his sister.", "It was clear that from\r\n_somewhere_ money had been acquired.", "I thought I could even detect a\r\ncertain shamefacedness in the General’s glance.", "Maria Philipovna, too,\r\nseemed distraught, and conversed with me with an air of detachment.", "Nevertheless, she took the money which I handed to her, counted it, and\r\nlistened to what I had to tell.", "To luncheon there were expected that\r\nday a Monsieur Mezentsov, a French lady, and an Englishman; for,\r\nwhenever money was in hand, a banquet in Muscovite style was always\r\ngiven.", "Polina Alexandrovna, on seeing me, inquired why I had been so\r\nlong away.", "Then, without waiting for an answer, she departed.", "Evidently\r\nthis was not mere accident, and I felt that I must throw some light\r\nupon matters.", "It was high time that I did so.", "I was assigned a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel (for you\r\nmust know that I belonged to the General’s suite).", "So far as I could\r\nsee, the party had already gained some notoriety in the place, which\r\nhad come to look upon the General as a Russian nobleman of great\r\nwealth.", "Indeed, even before luncheon he charged me, among other things,\r\nto get two thousand-franc notes changed for him at the hotel counter,\r\nwhich put us in a position to be thought millionaires at all events for\r\na week!", "Later, I was about to take Mischa and Nadia for a walk when a\r\nsummons reached me from the staircase that I must attend the General.", "He began by deigning to inquire of me where I was going to take the\r\nchildren; and as he did so, I could see that he failed to look me in\r\nthe eyes.", "He _wanted_ to do so, but each time was met by me with such a\r\nfixed, disrespectful stare that he desisted in confusion.", "In pompous\r\nlanguage, however, which jumbled one sentence into another, and at\r\nlength grew disconnected, he gave me to understand that I was to lead\r\nthe children altogether away from the Casino, and out into the park.", "Finally his anger exploded, and he added sharply:\r\n\r\n“I suppose you would like to take them to the Casino to play roulette?", "Well, excuse my speaking so plainly, but I know how addicted you are to\r\ngambling.", "Though I am not your mentor, nor wish to be, at least I have\r\na right to require that you shall not actually _compromise_ me.”\r\n\r\n“I have no money for gambling,” I quietly replied.", "“But you will soon be in receipt of some,” retorted the General,\r\nreddening a little as he dived into his writing desk and applied\r\nhimself to a memorandum book.", "From it he saw that he had 120 roubles of\r\nmine in his keeping.", "“Let us calculate,” he went on.", "“We must translate these roubles into\r\nthalers.", "Here—take 100 thalers, as a round sum.", "The rest will be safe\r\nin my hands.”\r\n\r\nIn silence I took the money.", "“You must not be offended at what I say,” he continued.", "“You are too\r\ntouchy about these things.", "What I have said I have said merely as a\r\nwarning.", "To do so is no more than my right.”\r\n\r\nWhen returning home with the children before luncheon, I met a\r\ncavalcade of our party riding to view some ruins.", "Two splendid\r\ncarriages, magnificently horsed, with Mlle.", "Blanche, Maria Philipovna,\r\nand Polina Alexandrovna in one of them, and the Frenchman, the\r\nEnglishman, and the General in attendance on horseback!"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_2", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 2)", "language": "de", "content": "The passers-by\r\nstopped to stare at them, for the effect was splendid—the General could\r\nnot have improved upon it. I calculated that, with the 4000 francs\r\nwhich I had brought with me, added to what my patrons seemed already to\r\nhave acquired, the party must be in possession of at least 7000 or 8000\r\nfrancs—though that would be none too much for Mlle. Blanche, who, with\r\nher mother and the Frenchman, was also lodging in our hotel. The latter\r\ngentleman was called by the lacqueys “Monsieur le Comte,” and Mlle. Blanche’s mother was dubbed “Madame la Comtesse.” Perhaps in very truth\r\nthey _were_ “Comte et Comtesse.”\r\n\r\nI knew that “Monsieur le Comte” would take no notice of me when we met\r\nat dinner, as also that the General would not dream of introducing us,\r\nnor of recommending me to the “Comte.” However, the latter had lived\r\nawhile in Russia, and knew that the person referred to as an “uchitel”\r\nis never looked upon as a bird of fine feather. Of course, strictly\r\nspeaking, he _knew_ me; but I was an uninvited guest at the\r\nluncheon—the General had forgotten to arrange otherwise, or I should\r\nhave been dispatched to dine at the table d’hôte. Nevertheless, I\r\npresented myself in such guise that the General looked at me with a\r\ntouch of approval; and, though the good Maria Philipovna was for\r\nshowing me my place, the fact of my having previously met the\r\nEnglishman, Mr. Astley, saved me, and thenceforward I figured as one of\r\nthe company. This strange Englishman I had met first in Prussia, where we had\r\nhappened to sit _vis-à-vis_ in a railway train in which I was\r\ntravelling to overtake our party; while, later, I had run across him in\r\nFrance, and again in Switzerland—twice within the space of two weeks! To think, therefore, that I should suddenly encounter him again here,\r\nin Roulettenberg! Never in my life had I known a more retiring man, for\r\nhe was shy to the pitch of imbecility, yet well aware of the fact (for\r\nhe was no fool). At the same time, he was a gentle, amiable sort of an\r\nindividual, and, even on our first encounter in Prussia I had contrived\r\nto draw him out, and he had told me that he had just been to the North\r\nCape, and was now anxious to visit the fair at Nizhni Novgorod. How he\r\nhad come to make the General’s acquaintance I do not know, but,\r\napparently, he was much struck with Polina. Also, he was delighted that\r\nI should sit next him at table, for he appeared to look upon me as his\r\nbosom friend. During the meal the Frenchman was in great feather: he was discursive\r\nand pompous to every one. In Moscow too, I remembered, he had blown a\r\ngreat many bubbles. Interminably he discoursed on finance and Russian\r\npolitics, and though, at times, the General made feints to contradict\r\nhim, he did so humbly, and as though wishing not wholly to lose sight\r\nof his own dignity. For myself, I was in a curious frame of mind. Even before luncheon was\r\nhalf finished I had asked myself the old, eternal question: “_Why_ do I\r\ncontinue to dance attendance upon the General, instead of having left\r\nhim and his family long ago?” Every now and then I would glance at\r\nPolina Alexandrovna, but she paid me no attention; until eventually I\r\nbecame so irritated that I decided to play the boor. First of all I suddenly, and for no reason whatever, plunged loudly and\r\ngratuitously into the general conversation. Above everything I wanted\r\nto pick a quarrel with the Frenchman; and, with that end in view I\r\nturned to the General, and exclaimed in an overbearing sort of\r\nway—indeed, I think that I actually interrupted him—that that summer it\r\nhad been almost impossible for a Russian to dine anywhere at tables\r\nd’hôte.

The General eyed me doubtfully, for he did not\r\nknow whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that I should so\r\nfar forget myself. “Of course, one always learns _something everywhere_,” said the\r\nFrenchman in a careless, contemptuous sort of tone. “In Paris, too, I had a dispute with a Pole,” I continued, “and then\r\nwith a French officer who supported him. After that a section of the\r\nFrenchmen present took my part. They did so as soon as I told them the\r\nstory of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor’s coffee.”\r\n\r\n“To spit into it?” the General inquired with grave disapproval in his\r\ntone, and a stare, of astonishment, while the Frenchman looked at me\r\nunbelievingly. “Just so,” I replied. “You must know that, on one occasion, when, for\r\ntwo days, I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart\r\nfor Rome on business, I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in\r\nParis, to have my passport visaed. There I encountered a sacristan of\r\nabout fifty, and a man dry and cold of mien. After listening politely,\r\nbut with great reserve, to my account of myself, this sacristan asked\r\nme to wait a little. I was in a great hurry to depart, but of course I\r\nsat down, pulled out a copy of _L’Opinion Nationale_, and fell to\r\nreading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it\r\nhappened to contain. As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an\r\nadjoining room and ask for Monsignor; after which I saw the sacristan\r\nmake a low bow to the visitor, and then another bow as the visitor took\r\nhis leave. I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also;\r\nwhereupon, with an expression of, if anything, increased dryness, he\r\nagain asked me to wait. Soon a third visitor arrived who, like myself,\r\nhad come on business (he was an Austrian of some sort); and as soon as\r\never he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs! This made me\r\nvery angry. I rose, approached the sacristan, and told him that, since\r\nMonsignor was receiving callers, his lordship might just as well finish\r\noff my affair as well. Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in\r\nastonishment. It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant\r\nRussian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of\r\nMonsignor’s! In a tone of the utmost effrontery, as though he were\r\ndelighted to have a chance of insulting me, he looked me up and down,\r\nand then said: “Do you suppose that Monsignor is going to put aside his\r\ncoffee for _you?_” But I only cried the louder: “Let me tell you that I\r\nam going to _spit_ into that coffee! Yes, and if you do not get me my\r\npassport visaed this very minute, I shall take it to Monsignor myself.”\r\n\r\n“What? While he is engaged with a Cardinal?” screeched the sacristan,\r\nagain shrinking back in horror. Then, rushing to the door, he spread\r\nout his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter. Thereupon I declared that I was a heretic and a barbarian—“Je suis\r\nhérétique et barbare,” I said, “and that these archbishops and\r\ncardinals and monsignors, and the rest of them, meant nothing at all to\r\nme. In a word, I showed him that I was not going to give way. He looked\r\nat me with an air of infinite resentment. Then he snatched up my\r\npassport, and departed with it upstairs. A minute later the passport\r\nhad been visaed! Here it is now, if you care to see it,”—and I pulled\r\nout the document, and exhibited the Roman visa. “But—” the General began. “What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a\r\nheretic and a barbarian,” remarked the Frenchman with a smile. “Cela\r\nn’était pas si bête.”\r\n\r\n“But is _that_ how Russian subjects ought to be treated?", "sentences": ["Both at\r\nParis and on the Rhine, and even in Switzerland—there are so many\r\nPoles, with their sympathisers, the French, at these tables d’hôte that\r\none cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian.”\r\n\r\nThis I said in French.", "The General eyed me doubtfully, for he did not\r\nknow whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that I should so\r\nfar forget myself.", "“Of course, one always learns _something everywhere_,” said the\r\nFrenchman in a careless, contemptuous sort of tone.", "“In Paris, too, I had a dispute with a Pole,” I continued, “and then\r\nwith a French officer who supported him.", "After that a section of the\r\nFrenchmen present took my part.", "They did so as soon as I told them the\r\nstory of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor’s coffee.”\r\n\r\n“To spit into it?” the General inquired with grave disapproval in his\r\ntone, and a stare, of astonishment, while the Frenchman looked at me\r\nunbelievingly.", "“Just so,” I replied.", "“You must know that, on one occasion, when, for\r\ntwo days, I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart\r\nfor Rome on business, I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in\r\nParis, to have my passport visaed.", "There I encountered a sacristan of\r\nabout fifty, and a man dry and cold of mien.", "After listening politely,\r\nbut with great reserve, to my account of myself, this sacristan asked\r\nme to wait a little.", "I was in a great hurry to depart, but of course I\r\nsat down, pulled out a copy of _L’Opinion Nationale_, and fell to\r\nreading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it\r\nhappened to contain.", "As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an\r\nadjoining room and ask for Monsignor; after which I saw the sacristan\r\nmake a low bow to the visitor, and then another bow as the visitor took\r\nhis leave.", "I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also;\r\nwhereupon, with an expression of, if anything, increased dryness, he\r\nagain asked me to wait.", "Soon a third visitor arrived who, like myself,\r\nhad come on business (he was an Austrian of some sort); and as soon as\r\never he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs!", "This made me\r\nvery angry.", "I rose, approached the sacristan, and told him that, since\r\nMonsignor was receiving callers, his lordship might just as well finish\r\noff my affair as well.", "Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in\r\nastonishment.", "It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant\r\nRussian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of\r\nMonsignor’s!", "In a tone of the utmost effrontery, as though he were\r\ndelighted to have a chance of insulting me, he looked me up and down,\r\nand then said: “Do you suppose that Monsignor is going to put aside his\r\ncoffee for _you?_” But I only cried the louder: “Let me tell you that I\r\nam going to _spit_ into that coffee!", "Yes, and if you do not get me my\r\npassport visaed this very minute, I shall take it to Monsignor myself.”\r\n\r\n“What?", "While he is engaged with a Cardinal?” screeched the sacristan,\r\nagain shrinking back in horror.", "Then, rushing to the door, he spread\r\nout his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter.", "Thereupon I declared that I was a heretic and a barbarian—“Je suis\r\nhérétique et barbare,” I said, “and that these archbishops and\r\ncardinals and monsignors, and the rest of them, meant nothing at all to\r\nme.", "In a word, I showed him that I was not going to give way.", "He looked\r\nat me with an air of infinite resentment.", "Then he snatched up my\r\npassport, and departed with it upstairs.", "A minute later the passport\r\nhad been visaed!", "Here it is now, if you care to see it,”—and I pulled\r\nout the document, and exhibited the Roman visa.", "“But—” the General began.", "“What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a\r\nheretic and a barbarian,” remarked the Frenchman with a smile.", "“Cela\r\nn’était pas si bête.”\r\n\r\n“But is _that_ how Russian subjects ought to be treated?"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_4", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 4)", "language": "de", "content": "Why, when they\r\nsettle here they dare not utter even a word—they are ready even to deny\r\nthe fact that they are Russians!

We entered the Park, and approached the Casino, where Polina\r\nseated herself upon a bench near the fountain, and sent Nadia away to a\r\nlittle distance to play with some other children.

Polina seemed\r\nfurious when I handed her only 700 gülden, for she had thought to\r\nreceive from Paris, as the proceeds of the pledging of her diamonds, at\r\nleast 2000 gülden, or even more. “Come what may, I _must_ have money,” she said. “And get it somehow I\r\nwill—otherwise I shall be ruined.”\r\n\r\nI asked her what had happened during my absence. “Nothing; except that two pieces of news have reached us from St. Petersburg. In the first place, my grandmother is very ill, and\r\nunlikely to last another couple of days. We had this from Timothy\r\nPetrovitch himself, and he is a reliable person. Every moment we are\r\nexpecting to receive news of the end.”\r\n\r\n“All of you are on the tiptoe of expectation?” I queried. “Of course—all of us, and every minute of the day. For a\r\nyear-and-a-half now we have been looking for this.”\r\n\r\n“Looking for it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, looking for it. I am not her blood relation, you know—I am merely\r\nthe General’s step-daughter. Yet I am certain that the old lady has\r\nremembered me in her will.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I believe that you _will_ come in for a good deal,” I said with\r\nsome assurance. “Yes, for she is fond of me. But how come you to think so?”\r\n\r\nI answered this question with another one. “That Marquis of yours,” I\r\nsaid, “—is _he_ also familiar with your family secrets?”\r\n\r\n“And why are you yourself so interested in them?” was her retort as she\r\neyed me with dry grimness. “Never mind. If I am not mistaken, the General has succeeded in\r\nborrowing money of the Marquis.”\r\n\r\n“It may be so.”\r\n\r\n“Is it likely that the Marquis would have lent the money if he had not\r\nknown something or other about your grandmother?

Why, I thought he had been\r\ndoing so a long while!”\r\n\r\n“You _know_ he has not,” retorted Polina angrily. “But where on earth\r\ndid you pick up this Englishman?” She said this after a pause. “I _knew_ you would ask about him!” Whereupon I told her of my previous\r\nencounters with Astley while travelling. “He is very shy,” I said, “and susceptible. Also, he is in love with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he _is_ in love with me,” she replied. “And he is ten times richer than the Frenchman. In fact, what does the\r\nFrenchman possess? To me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses\r\nanything at all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, there is no doubt about it. He does possess some château or\r\nother. Last night the General told me that for certain. _Now_ are you\r\nsatisfied?”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, in your place I should marry the Englishman.”\r\n\r\n“And why?” asked Polina. “Because, though the Frenchman is the handsomer of the two, he is also\r\nthe baser; whereas the Englishman is not only a man of honour, but ten\r\ntimes the wealthier of the pair.”\r\n\r\n“Yes? But then the Frenchman is a marquis, and the cleverer of the\r\ntwo,” remarked Polina imperturbably. “Is that so?” I repeated. “Yes; absolutely.”\r\n\r\nPolina was not at all pleased at my questions; I could see that she was\r\ndoing her best to irritate me with the brusquerie of her answers. But I\r\ntook no notice of this. “It amuses me to see you grow angry,” she continued. “However, inasmuch\r\nas I allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures, you ought\r\nto pay me something for the privilege.”\r\n\r\n“I consider that I have a perfect right to put these questions to you,”\r\nwas my calm retort; “for the reason that I am ready to pay for them,\r\nand also care little what becomes of me.”\r\n\r\nPolina giggled. “Last time you told me—when on the Shlangenberg—that at a word from me\r\nyou would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss. Some\r\nday I may remind you of that saying, in order to see if you will be as\r\ngood as your word. Yes, you may depend upon it that I shall do so. I\r\nhate you because I have allowed you to go to such lengths, and I also\r\nhate you and still more—because you are so necessary to me. For the\r\ntime being I want you, so I must keep you.”\r\n\r\nThen she made a movement to rise. Her tone had sounded very angry. Indeed, of late her talks with me had invariably ended on a note of\r\ntemper and irritation—yes, of real temper. “May I ask you who is this Mlle. Blanche?” I inquired (since I did not\r\nwish Polina to depart without an explanation). “You _know_ who she is—just Mlle. Blanche. Nothing further has\r\ntranspired. Probably she will soon be Madame General—that is to say, if\r\nthe rumours that Grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true. Mlle. Blanche, with her mother and her cousin, the Marquis, know very well\r\nthat, as things now stand, we are ruined.”\r\n\r\n“And is the General at last in love?”\r\n\r\n“That has nothing to do with it. Listen to me. Take these 700 florins,\r\nand go and play roulette with them. Win as much for me as you can, for\r\nI am badly in need of money.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, she called Nadia back to her side, and entered the Casino,\r\nwhere she joined the rest of our party. For myself, I took, in musing\r\nastonishment, the first path to the left. Something had seemed to\r\nstrike my brain when she told me to go and play roulette. Strangely\r\nenough, that something had also seemed to make me hesitate, and to set\r\nme analysing my feelings with regard to her. In fact, during the two\r\nweeks of my absence I had felt far more at my ease than I did now, on\r\nthe day of my return; although, while travelling, I had moped like an\r\nimbecile, rushed about like a man in a fever, and actually beheld her\r\nin my dreams. Indeed, on one occasion (this happened in Switzerland,\r\nwhen I was asleep in the train) I had spoken aloud to her, and set all\r\nmy fellow-travellers laughing.", "sentences": ["I thought\r\nyou ought to know that.”\r\n\r\n“Then he has only just begun his courting?", "Why, I thought he had been\r\ndoing so a long while!”\r\n\r\n“You _know_ he has not,” retorted Polina angrily.", "“But where on earth\r\ndid you pick up this Englishman?” She said this after a pause.", "“I _knew_ you would ask about him!” Whereupon I told her of my previous\r\nencounters with Astley while travelling.", "“He is very shy,” I said, “and susceptible.", "Also, he is in love with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he _is_ in love with me,” she replied.", "“And he is ten times richer than the Frenchman.", "In fact, what does the\r\nFrenchman possess?", "To me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses\r\nanything at all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, there is no doubt about it.", "He does possess some château or\r\nother.", "Last night the General told me that for certain.", "_Now_ are you\r\nsatisfied?”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, in your place I should marry the Englishman.”\r\n\r\n“And why?” asked Polina.", "“Because, though the Frenchman is the handsomer of the two, he is also\r\nthe baser; whereas the Englishman is not only a man of honour, but ten\r\ntimes the wealthier of the pair.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?", "But then the Frenchman is a marquis, and the cleverer of the\r\ntwo,” remarked Polina imperturbably.", "“Is that so?” I repeated.", "“Yes; absolutely.”\r\n\r\nPolina was not at all pleased at my questions; I could see that she was\r\ndoing her best to irritate me with the brusquerie of her answers.", "But I\r\ntook no notice of this.", "“It amuses me to see you grow angry,” she continued.", "“However, inasmuch\r\nas I allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures, you ought\r\nto pay me something for the privilege.”\r\n\r\n“I consider that I have a perfect right to put these questions to you,”\r\nwas my calm retort; “for the reason that I am ready to pay for them,\r\nand also care little what becomes of me.”\r\n\r\nPolina giggled.", "“Last time you told me—when on the Shlangenberg—that at a word from me\r\nyou would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss.", "Some\r\nday I may remind you of that saying, in order to see if you will be as\r\ngood as your word.", "Yes, you may depend upon it that I shall do so.", "I\r\nhate you because I have allowed you to go to such lengths, and I also\r\nhate you and still more—because you are so necessary to me.", "For the\r\ntime being I want you, so I must keep you.”\r\n\r\nThen she made a movement to rise.", "Her tone had sounded very angry.", "Indeed, of late her talks with me had invariably ended on a note of\r\ntemper and irritation—yes, of real temper.", "“May I ask you who is this Mlle.", "Blanche?” I inquired (since I did not\r\nwish Polina to depart without an explanation).", "“You _know_ who she is—just Mlle.", "Blanche.", "Nothing further has\r\ntranspired.", "Probably she will soon be Madame General—that is to say, if\r\nthe rumours that Grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true.", "Mlle.", "Blanche, with her mother and her cousin, the Marquis, know very well\r\nthat, as things now stand, we are ruined.”\r\n\r\n“And is the General at last in love?”\r\n\r\n“That has nothing to do with it.", "Listen to me.", "Take these 700 florins,\r\nand go and play roulette with them.", "Win as much for me as you can, for\r\nI am badly in need of money.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, she called Nadia back to her side, and entered the Casino,\r\nwhere she joined the rest of our party.", "For myself, I took, in musing\r\nastonishment, the first path to the left.", "Something had seemed to\r\nstrike my brain when she told me to go and play roulette.", "Strangely\r\nenough, that something had also seemed to make me hesitate, and to set\r\nme analysing my feelings with regard to her.", "In fact, during the two\r\nweeks of my absence I had felt far more at my ease than I did now, on\r\nthe day of my return; although, while travelling, I had moped like an\r\nimbecile, rushed about like a man in a fever, and actually beheld her\r\nin my dreams.", "Indeed, on one occasion (this happened in Switzerland,\r\nwhen I was asleep in the train) I had spoken aloud to her, and set all\r\nmy fellow-travellers laughing."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_6", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 6)", "language": "de", "content": "Again, therefore, I put to myself the\r\nquestion: “Do I, or do I not love her?” and again I could return myself\r\nno answer or, rather, for the hundredth time I told myself that I\r\ndetested her. Yes, I detested her; there were moments (more especially\r\nat the close of our talks together) when I would gladly have given half\r\nmy life to have strangled her! I swear that, had there, at such\r\nmoments, been a sharp knife ready to my hand, I would have seized that\r\nknife with pleasure, and plunged it into her breast. Yet I also swear\r\nthat if, on the Shlangenberg, she had _really_ said to me, “Leap into\r\nthat abyss,” I should have leapt into it, and with equal pleasure. Yes,\r\nthis I knew well. One way or the other, the thing must soon be ended. She, too, knew it in some curious way; the thought that I was fully\r\nconscious of her inaccessibility, and of the impossibility of my ever\r\nrealising my dreams, afforded her, I am certain, the keenest possible\r\npleasure. Otherwise, is it likely that she, the cautious and clever\r\nwoman that she was, would have indulged in this familiarity and\r\nopenness with me? Hitherto (I concluded) she had looked upon me in the\r\nsame light that the old Empress did upon her servant—the Empress who\r\nhesitated not to unrobe herself before her slave, since she did not\r\naccount a slave a man. Yes, often Polina must have taken me for\r\nsomething less than a man!”\r\n\r\nStill, she had charged me with a commission—to win what I could at\r\nroulette. Yet all the time I could not help wondering _why_ it was so\r\nnecessary for her to win something, and what new schemes could have\r\nsprung to birth in her ever-fertile brain. A host of new and unknown\r\nfactors seemed to have arisen during the last two weeks. Well, it\r\nbehoved me to divine them, and to probe them, and that as soon as\r\npossible. Yet not now: at the present moment I must repair to the\r\nroulette-table. II\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess I did not like it. Although I had made up my mind to play, I\r\nfelt averse to doing so on behalf of some one else. In fact, it almost\r\nupset my balance, and I entered the gaming rooms with an angry feeling\r\nat my heart. At first glance the scene irritated me. Never at any time\r\nhave I been able to bear the flunkeyishness which one meets in the\r\nPress of the world at large, but more especially in that of Russia,\r\nwhere, almost every evening, journalists write on two subjects in\r\nparticular—namely, on the splendour and luxury of the casinos to be\r\nfound in the Rhenish towns, and on the heaps of gold which are daily to\r\nbe seen lying on their tables. Those journalists are not paid for doing\r\nso: they write thus merely out of a spirit of disinterested\r\ncomplaisance. For there is nothing splendid about the establishments in\r\nquestion; and, not only are there no heaps of gold to be seen lying on\r\ntheir tables, but also there is very little money to be seen at all. Of\r\ncourse, during the season, _some_ madman or another may make his\r\nappearance—generally an Englishman, or an Asiatic, or a Turk—and (as\r\nhad happened during the summer of which I write) win or lose a great\r\ndeal; but, as regards the rest of the crowd, it plays only for petty\r\ngülden, and seldom does much wealth figure on the board. When, on the present occasion, I entered the gaming-rooms (for the\r\nfirst time in my life), it was several moments before I could even make\r\nup my mind to play. For one thing, the crowd oppressed me.

For why is gambling a whit worse\r\nthan any other method of acquiring money? How, for instance, is it\r\nworse than trade? True, out of a hundred persons, only one can win; yet\r\nwhat business is that of yours or of mine? At all events, I confined myself at first simply to looking on, and\r\ndecided to attempt nothing serious. Indeed, I felt that, if I began to\r\ndo anything at all, I should do it in an absent-minded, haphazard sort\r\nof way—of that I felt certain. Also, it behoved me to learn the game\r\nitself; since, despite a thousand descriptions of roulette which I had\r\nread with ceaseless avidity, I knew nothing of its rules, and had never\r\neven seen it played. In the first place, everything about it seemed to me so foul—so morally\r\nmean and foul. Yet I am not speaking of the hungry, restless folk who,\r\nby scores nay, even by hundreds—could be seen crowded around the\r\ngaming-tables. For in a desire to win quickly and to win much I can see\r\nnothing sordid; I have always applauded the opinion of a certain dead\r\nand gone, but cocksure, moralist who replied to the excuse that “one\r\nmay always gamble moderately”, by saying that to do so makes things\r\nworse, since, in that case, the profits too will always be moderate. Insignificant profits and sumptuous profits do not stand on the same\r\nfooting. No, it is all a matter of proportion. What may seem a small\r\nsum to a Rothschild may seem a large sum to me, and it is not the fault\r\nof stakes or of winnings that everywhere men can be found winning, can\r\nbe found depriving their fellows of something, just as they do at\r\nroulette. As to the question whether stakes and winnings are, in\r\nthemselves, immoral is another question altogether, and I wish to\r\nexpress no opinion upon it. Yet the very fact that I was full of a\r\nstrong desire to win caused this gambling for gain, in spite of its\r\nattendant squalor, to contain, if you will, something intimate,\r\nsomething sympathetic, to my eyes: for it is always pleasant to see men\r\ndispensing with ceremony, and acting naturally, and in an unbuttoned\r\nmood.... Yet why should I so deceive myself? I could see that the whole thing\r\nwas a vain and unreasoning pursuit; and what, at the first glance,\r\nseemed to me the ugliest feature in this mob of roulette players was\r\ntheir respect for their occupation—the seriousness, and even the\r\nhumility, with which they stood around the gaming tables. Moreover, I\r\nhad always drawn sharp distinctions between a game which is _de mauvais\r\ngenre_ and a game which is permissible to a decent man. In fact, there\r\nare two sorts of gaming—namely, the game of the gentleman and the game\r\nof the plebs—the game for gain, and the game of the herd. Herein, as\r\nsaid, I draw sharp distinctions. Yet how essentially base are the\r\ndistinctions! For instance, a gentleman may stake, say, five or ten\r\nlouis d’or—seldom more, unless he is a very rich man, when he may\r\nstake, say, a thousand francs; but, he must do this simply for the love\r\nof the game itself—simply for sport, simply in order to observe the\r\nprocess of winning or of losing, and, above all things, as a man who\r\nremains quite uninterested in the possibility of his issuing a winner. If he wins, he will be at liberty, perhaps, to give vent to a laugh, or\r\nto pass a remark on the circumstance to a bystander, or to stake again,\r\nor to double his stake; but, even this he must do solely out of\r\ncuriosity, and for the pleasure of watching the play of chances and of\r\ncalculations, and not because of any vulgar desire to win. In a word,\r\nhe must look upon the gaming-table, upon roulette, and upon trente et\r\nquarante, as mere relaxations which have been arranged solely for his\r\namusement.", "sentences": ["However ridiculous it may seem to you that\r\nI was expecting to win at roulette, I look upon the generally accepted\r\nopinion concerning the folly and the grossness of hoping to win at\r\ngambling as a thing even more absurd.", "For why is gambling a whit worse\r\nthan any other method of acquiring money?", "How, for instance, is it\r\nworse than trade?", "True, out of a hundred persons, only one can win; yet\r\nwhat business is that of yours or of mine?", "At all events, I confined myself at first simply to looking on, and\r\ndecided to attempt nothing serious.", "Indeed, I felt that, if I began to\r\ndo anything at all, I should do it in an absent-minded, haphazard sort\r\nof way—of that I felt certain.", "Also, it behoved me to learn the game\r\nitself; since, despite a thousand descriptions of roulette which I had\r\nread with ceaseless avidity, I knew nothing of its rules, and had never\r\neven seen it played.", "In the first place, everything about it seemed to me so foul—so morally\r\nmean and foul.", "Yet I am not speaking of the hungry, restless folk who,\r\nby scores nay, even by hundreds—could be seen crowded around the\r\ngaming-tables.", "For in a desire to win quickly and to win much I can see\r\nnothing sordid; I have always applauded the opinion of a certain dead\r\nand gone, but cocksure, moralist who replied to the excuse that “one\r\nmay always gamble moderately”, by saying that to do so makes things\r\nworse, since, in that case, the profits too will always be moderate.", "Insignificant profits and sumptuous profits do not stand on the same\r\nfooting.", "No, it is all a matter of proportion.", "What may seem a small\r\nsum to a Rothschild may seem a large sum to me, and it is not the fault\r\nof stakes or of winnings that everywhere men can be found winning, can\r\nbe found depriving their fellows of something, just as they do at\r\nroulette.", "As to the question whether stakes and winnings are, in\r\nthemselves, immoral is another question altogether, and I wish to\r\nexpress no opinion upon it.", "Yet the very fact that I was full of a\r\nstrong desire to win caused this gambling for gain, in spite of its\r\nattendant squalor, to contain, if you will, something intimate,\r\nsomething sympathetic, to my eyes: for it is always pleasant to see men\r\ndispensing with ceremony, and acting naturally, and in an unbuttoned\r\nmood....", "Yet why should I so deceive myself?", "I could see that the whole thing\r\nwas a vain and unreasoning pursuit; and what, at the first glance,\r\nseemed to me the ugliest feature in this mob of roulette players was\r\ntheir respect for their occupation—the seriousness, and even the\r\nhumility, with which they stood around the gaming tables.", "Moreover, I\r\nhad always drawn sharp distinctions between a game which is _de mauvais\r\ngenre_ and a game which is permissible to a decent man.", "In fact, there\r\nare two sorts of gaming—namely, the game of the gentleman and the game\r\nof the plebs—the game for gain, and the game of the herd.", "Herein, as\r\nsaid, I draw sharp distinctions.", "Yet how essentially base are the\r\ndistinctions!", "For instance, a gentleman may stake, say, five or ten\r\nlouis d’or—seldom more, unless he is a very rich man, when he may\r\nstake, say, a thousand francs; but, he must do this simply for the love\r\nof the game itself—simply for sport, simply in order to observe the\r\nprocess of winning or of losing, and, above all things, as a man who\r\nremains quite uninterested in the possibility of his issuing a winner.", "If he wins, he will be at liberty, perhaps, to give vent to a laugh, or\r\nto pass a remark on the circumstance to a bystander, or to stake again,\r\nor to double his stake; but, even this he must do solely out of\r\ncuriosity, and for the pleasure of watching the play of chances and of\r\ncalculations, and not because of any vulgar desire to win.", "In a word,\r\nhe must look upon the gaming-table, upon roulette, and upon trente et\r\nquarante, as mere relaxations which have been arranged solely for his\r\namusement."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_8", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 8)", "language": "de", "content": "Of the existence of the lures and gains upon which the bank\r\nis founded and maintained he must profess to have not an inkling. Best\r\nof all, he ought to imagine his fellow-gamblers and the rest of the mob\r\nwhich stands trembling over a coin to be equally rich and gentlemanly\r\nwith himself, and playing solely for recreation and pleasure. This\r\ncomplete ignorance of the realities, this innocent view of mankind, is\r\nwhat, in my opinion, constitutes the truly aristocratic. For instance,\r\nI have seen even fond mothers so far indulge their guileless, elegant\r\ndaughters—misses of fifteen or sixteen—as to give them a few gold coins\r\nand teach them how to play; and though the young ladies may have won or\r\nhave lost, they have invariably laughed, and departed as though they\r\nwere well pleased. In the same way, I saw our General once approach the\r\ntable in a stolid, important manner. A lacquey darted to offer him a\r\nchair, but the General did not even notice him. Slowly he took out his\r\nmoney bags, and slowly extracted 300 francs in gold, which he staked on\r\nthe black, and won. Yet he did not take up his winnings—he left them\r\nthere on the table. Again the black turned up, and again he did not\r\ngather in what he had won; and when, in the third round, the _red_\r\nturned up he lost, at a stroke, 1200 francs. Yet even then he rose with\r\na smile, and thus preserved his reputation; yet I knew that his money\r\nbags must be chafing his heart, as well as that, had the stake been\r\ntwice or thrice as much again, he would still have restrained himself\r\nfrom venting his disappointment. On the other hand, I saw a Frenchman first win, and then lose, 30,000\r\nfrancs cheerfully, and without a murmur. Yes; even if a gentleman\r\nshould lose his whole substance, he must never give way to annoyance. Money must be so subservient to gentility as never to be worth a\r\nthought. Of course, the _supremely_ aristocratic thing is to be\r\nentirely oblivious of the mire of rabble, with its setting; but\r\nsometimes a reverse course may be aristocratic to remark, to scan, and\r\neven to gape at, the mob (for preference, through a lorgnette), even as\r\nthough one were taking the crowd and its squalor for a sort of raree\r\nshow which had been organised specially for a gentleman’s diversion. Though one may be squeezed by the crowd, one must look as though one\r\nwere fully assured of being the observer—of having neither part nor lot\r\nwith the observed. At the same time, to stare fixedly about one is\r\nunbecoming; for that, again, is ungentlemanly, seeing that no spectacle\r\nis worth an open stare—are no spectacles in the world which merit from\r\na gentleman too pronounced an inspection. However, to me personally the scene _did_ seem to be worth undisguised\r\ncontemplation—more especially in view of the fact that I had come there\r\nnot only to look at, but also to number myself sincerely and\r\nwholeheartedly with, the mob. As for my secret moral views, I had no\r\nroom for them amongst my actual, practical opinions. Let that stand as\r\nwritten: I am writing only to relieve my conscience. Yet let me say\r\nalso this: that from the first I have been consistent in having an\r\nintense aversion to any trial of my acts and thoughts by a moral\r\nstandard. Another standard altogether has directed my life.... As a matter of fact, the mob was playing in exceedingly foul fashion. Indeed, I have an idea that sheer robbery was going on around that\r\ngaming-table. The croupiers who sat at the two ends of it had not only\r\nto watch the stakes, but also to calculate the game—an immense amount\r\nof work for two men! As for the crowd itself—well, it consisted mostly\r\nof Frenchmen. Yet I was not then taking notes merely in order to be\r\nable to give you a description of roulette, but in order to get my\r\nbearings as to my behaviour when I myself should begin to play.

I could only divine and\r\ndistinguish that stakes were hazarded on numbers, on “odd” or “even,”\r\nand on colours. Polina’s money I decided to risk, that evening, only to\r\nthe amount of 100 gülden. The thought that I was not going to play for\r\nmyself quite unnerved me. It was an unpleasant sensation, and I tried\r\nhard to banish it. I had a feeling that, once I had begun to play for\r\nPolina, I should wreck my own fortunes. Also, I wonder if any one has\r\n_ever_ approached a gaming-table without falling an immediate prey to\r\nsuperstition? I began by pulling out fifty gülden, and staking them on\r\n“even.” The wheel spun and stopped at 13. I had lost! With a feeling\r\nlike a sick qualm, as though I would like to make my way out of the\r\ncrowd and go home, I staked another fifty gülden—this time on the red. The red turned up. Next time I staked the 100 gülden just where they\r\nlay—and again the red turned up. Again I staked the whole sum, and\r\nagain the red turned up. Clutching my 400 gülden, I placed 200 of them\r\non twelve figures, to see what would come of it. The result was that\r\nthe croupier paid me out three times my total stake! Thus from 100\r\ngülden my store had grown to 800! Upon that such a curious, such an\r\ninexplicable, unwonted feeling overcame me that I decided to depart. Always the thought kept recurring to me that if I had been playing for\r\nmyself alone I should never have had such luck. Once more I staked the\r\nwhole 800 gülden on the “even.” The wheel stopped at 4. I was paid out\r\nanother 800 gülden, and, snatching up my pile of 1600, departed in\r\nsearch of Polina Alexandrovna. I found the whole party walking in the park, and was able to get an\r\ninterview with her only after supper. This time the Frenchman was\r\nabsent from the meal, and the General seemed to be in a more expansive\r\nvein. Among other things, he thought it necessary to remind me that he\r\nwould be sorry to see me playing at the gaming-tables. In his opinion,\r\nsuch conduct would greatly compromise him—especially if I were to lose\r\nmuch. “And even if you were to _win_ much I should be compromised,” he\r\nadded in a meaning sort of way. “Of course I have no _right_ to order\r\nyour actions, but you yourself will agree that...” As usual, he did not\r\nfinish his sentence. I answered drily that I had very little money in\r\nmy possession, and that, consequently, I was hardly in a position to\r\nindulge in any conspicuous play, even if I did gamble. At last, when\r\nascending to my own room, I succeeded in handing Polina her winnings,\r\nand told her that, next time, I should not play for her. “Why not?” she asked excitedly. “Because I wish to play _for myself_,” I replied with a feigned glance\r\nof astonishment. “That is my sole reason.”\r\n\r\n“Then are you so certain that your roulette-playing will get us out of\r\nour difficulties?” she inquired with a quizzical smile.

Consequently there became established between us relations which, to a\r\nlarge extent, were incomprehensible to me, considering her general\r\npride and aloofness. For example, although she knew that I was madly in\r\nlove with her, she allowed me to speak to her of my passion (though she\r\ncould not well have showed her contempt for me more than by permitting\r\nme, unhindered and unrebuked, to mention to her my love). “You see,” her attitude expressed, “how little I regard your feelings,\r\nas well as how little I care for what you say to me, or for what you\r\nfeel for me.” Likewise, though she spoke as before concerning her\r\naffairs, it was never with complete frankness. In her contempt for me\r\nthere were refinements. Although she knew well that I was aware of a\r\ncertain circumstance in her life of something which might one day cause\r\nher trouble, she would speak to me about her affairs (whenever she had\r\nneed of me for a given end) as though I were a slave or a passing\r\nacquaintance—yet tell them me only in so far as one would need to know\r\nthem if one were going to be made temporary use of. Had I not known the\r\nwhole chain of events, or had she not seen how much I was pained and\r\ndisturbed by her teasing insistency, she would never have thought it\r\nworthwhile to soothe me with this frankness—even though, since she not\r\ninfrequently used me to execute commissions that were not only\r\ntroublesome, but risky, she ought, in my opinion, to have been frank in\r\n_any_ case. But, forsooth, it was not worth her while to trouble about\r\n_my_ feelings—about the fact that _I_ was uneasy, and, perhaps, thrice\r\nas put about by her cares and misfortunes as she was herself! For three weeks I had known of her intention to take to roulette. She\r\nhad even warned me that she would like me to play on her behalf, since\r\nit was unbecoming for her to play in person; and, from the tone of her\r\nwords I had gathered that there was something on her mind besides a\r\nmere desire to win money. As if money could matter to _her!_ No, she\r\nhad some end in view, and there were circumstances at which I could\r\nguess, but which I did not know for certain. True, the slavery and\r\nabasement in which she held me might have given me (such things often\r\ndo so) the power to question her with abrupt directness (seeing that,\r\ninasmuch as I figured in her eyes as a mere slave and nonentity, she\r\ncould not very well have taken offence at any rude curiosity); but the\r\nfact was that, though she let me question her, she never returned me a\r\nsingle answer, and at times did not so much as notice me. That is how\r\nmatters stood. Next day there was a good deal of talk about a telegram which, four\r\ndays ago, had been sent to St. Petersburg, but to which there had come\r\nno answer.

Likewise\r\nI was aware, in part, of a family secret—namely, that, last year, the\r\nFrenchman had bailed the General out of debt, and given him 30,000\r\nroubles wherewith to pay his Treasury dues on retiring from the\r\nservice. And now, of course, the General was in a vice—although the\r\nchief part in the affair was being played by Mlle. Blanche. Yes, of\r\nthis last I had no doubt. But _who_ was this Mlle. Blanche? It was said of her that she was a\r\nFrenchwoman of good birth who, living with her mother, possessed a\r\ncolossal fortune. It was also said that she was some relation to the\r\nMarquis, but only a distant one a cousin, or cousin-german, or\r\nsomething of the sort. Likewise I knew that, up to the time of my\r\njourney to Paris, she and the Frenchman had been more ceremonious\r\ntowards our party—they had stood on a much more precise and delicate\r\nfooting with them; but that now their acquaintanceship—their\r\nfriendship, their intimacy—had taken on a much more off-hand and\r\nrough-and-ready air. Perhaps they thought that our means were too\r\nmodest for them, and, therefore, unworthy of politeness or reticence. Also, for the last three days I had noticed certain looks which Astley\r\nhad kept throwing at Mlle. Blanche and her mother; and it had occurred\r\nto me that he must have had some previous acquaintance with the pair. I\r\nhad even surmised that the Frenchman too must have met Mr. Astley\r\nbefore. Astley was a man so shy, reserved, and taciturn in his manner\r\nthat one might have looked for anything from him. At all events the\r\nFrenchman accorded him only the slightest of greetings, and scarcely\r\neven looked at him. Certainly he did not seem to be afraid of him;\r\nwhich was intelligible enough. But why did Mlle. Blanche also never\r\nlook at the Englishman?—particularly since, _à propos_ of something or\r\nanother, the Marquis had declared the Englishman to be immensely and\r\nindubitably rich? Was not that a sufficient reason to make Mlle. Blanche look at the Englishman? Anyway the General seemed extremely\r\nuneasy; and, one could well understand what a telegram to announce the\r\ndeath of his mother would mean for him! Although I thought it probable that Polina was avoiding me for a\r\ndefinite reason, I adopted a cold and indifferent air; for I felt\r\npretty certain that it would not be long before she herself approached\r\nme. For two days, therefore, I devoted my attention to Mlle. Blanche. The poor General was in despair! To fall in love at fifty-five, and\r\nwith such vehemence, is indeed a misfortune! And add to that his\r\nwidowerhood, his children, his ruined property, his debts, and the\r\nwoman with whom he had fallen in love! Though Mlle. Blanche was\r\nextremely good-looking, I may or may not be understood when I say that\r\nshe had one of those faces which one is afraid of. At all events, I\r\nmyself have always feared such women. Apparently about twenty-five\r\nyears of age, she was tall and broad-shouldered, with shoulders that\r\nsloped; yet though her neck and bosom were ample in their proportions,\r\nher skin was dull yellow in colour, while her hair (which was extremely\r\nabundant—sufficient to make two coiffures) was as black as Indian ink. Add to that a pair of black eyes with yellowish whites, a proud glance,\r\ngleaming teeth, and lips which were perennially pomaded and redolent of\r\nmusk. As for her dress, it was invariably rich, effective, and chic,\r\nyet in good taste. Lastly, her feet and hands were astonishing, and her\r\nvoice a deep contralto. Sometimes, when she laughed, she displayed her\r\nteeth, but at ordinary times her air was taciturn and\r\nhaughty—especially in the presence of Polina and Maria Philipovna.", "sentences": ["I had long\r\nbeen aware of certain circumstances which bound the General to him; I\r\nhad long been aware that in Russia they had hatched some scheme\r\ntogether although I did not know whether the plot had come to anything,\r\nor whether it was still only in the stage of being talked of.", "Likewise\r\nI was aware, in part, of a family secret—namely, that, last year, the\r\nFrenchman had bailed the General out of debt, and given him 30,000\r\nroubles wherewith to pay his Treasury dues on retiring from the\r\nservice.", "And now, of course, the General was in a vice—although the\r\nchief part in the affair was being played by Mlle.", "Blanche.", "Yes, of\r\nthis last I had no doubt.", "But _who_ was this Mlle.", "Blanche?", "It was said of her that she was a\r\nFrenchwoman of good birth who, living with her mother, possessed a\r\ncolossal fortune.", "It was also said that she was some relation to the\r\nMarquis, but only a distant one a cousin, or cousin-german, or\r\nsomething of the sort.", "Likewise I knew that, up to the time of my\r\njourney to Paris, she and the Frenchman had been more ceremonious\r\ntowards our party—they had stood on a much more precise and delicate\r\nfooting with them; but that now their acquaintanceship—their\r\nfriendship, their intimacy—had taken on a much more off-hand and\r\nrough-and-ready air.", "Perhaps they thought that our means were too\r\nmodest for them, and, therefore, unworthy of politeness or reticence.", "Also, for the last three days I had noticed certain looks which Astley\r\nhad kept throwing at Mlle.", "Blanche and her mother; and it had occurred\r\nto me that he must have had some previous acquaintance with the pair.", "I\r\nhad even surmised that the Frenchman too must have met Mr.", "Astley\r\nbefore.", "Astley was a man so shy, reserved, and taciturn in his manner\r\nthat one might have looked for anything from him.", "At all events the\r\nFrenchman accorded him only the slightest of greetings, and scarcely\r\neven looked at him.", "Certainly he did not seem to be afraid of him;\r\nwhich was intelligible enough.", "But why did Mlle.", "Blanche also never\r\nlook at the Englishman?—particularly since, _à propos_ of something or\r\nanother, the Marquis had declared the Englishman to be immensely and\r\nindubitably rich?", "Was not that a sufficient reason to make Mlle.", "Blanche look at the Englishman?", "Anyway the General seemed extremely\r\nuneasy; and, one could well understand what a telegram to announce the\r\ndeath of his mother would mean for him!", "Although I thought it probable that Polina was avoiding me for a\r\ndefinite reason, I adopted a cold and indifferent air; for I felt\r\npretty certain that it would not be long before she herself approached\r\nme.", "For two days, therefore, I devoted my attention to Mlle.", "Blanche.", "The poor General was in despair!", "To fall in love at fifty-five, and\r\nwith such vehemence, is indeed a misfortune!", "And add to that his\r\nwidowerhood, his children, his ruined property, his debts, and the\r\nwoman with whom he had fallen in love!", "Though Mlle.", "Blanche was\r\nextremely good-looking, I may or may not be understood when I say that\r\nshe had one of those faces which one is afraid of.", "At all events, I\r\nmyself have always feared such women.", "Apparently about twenty-five\r\nyears of age, she was tall and broad-shouldered, with shoulders that\r\nsloped; yet though her neck and bosom were ample in their proportions,\r\nher skin was dull yellow in colour, while her hair (which was extremely\r\nabundant—sufficient to make two coiffures) was as black as Indian ink.", "Add to that a pair of black eyes with yellowish whites, a proud glance,\r\ngleaming teeth, and lips which were perennially pomaded and redolent of\r\nmusk.", "As for her dress, it was invariably rich, effective, and chic,\r\nyet in good taste.", "Lastly, her feet and hands were astonishing, and her\r\nvoice a deep contralto.", "Sometimes, when she laughed, she displayed her\r\nteeth, but at ordinary times her air was taciturn and\r\nhaughty—especially in the presence of Polina and Maria Philipovna."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_12", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 12)", "language": "de", "content": "Yet\r\nshe seemed to me almost destitute of education, and even of wits,\r\nthough cunning and suspicious. This, apparently, was not because her\r\nlife had been lacking in incident. Perhaps, if all were known, the\r\nMarquis was not her kinsman at all, nor her mother, her mother; but\r\nthere was evidence that, in Berlin, where we had first come across the\r\npair, they had possessed acquaintances of good standing. As for the\r\nMarquis himself, I doubt to this day if he was a Marquis—although about\r\nthe fact that he had formerly belonged to high society (for instance,\r\nin Moscow and Germany) there could be no doubt whatever. What he had\r\nformerly been in France I had not a notion. All I knew was that he was\r\nsaid to possess a château. During the last two weeks I had looked for\r\nmuch to transpire, but am still ignorant whether at that time anything\r\ndecisive ever passed between Mademoiselle and the General. Everything\r\nseemed to depend upon our means—upon whether the General would be able\r\nto flourish sufficient money in her face. If ever the news should\r\narrive that the grandmother was not dead, Mlle. Blanche, I felt sure,\r\nwould disappear in a twinkling. Indeed, it surprised and amused me to\r\nobserve what a passion for intrigue I was developing. But how I loathed\r\nit all! With what pleasure would I have given everybody and everything\r\nthe go-by! Only—I could not leave Polina. How, then, could I show\r\ncontempt for those who surrounded her? Espionage is a base thing,\r\nbut—what have I to do with that? Mr. Astley, too, I found a curious person. I was only sure that he had\r\nfallen in love with Polina. A remarkable and diverting circumstance is\r\nthe amount which may lie in the mien of a shy and painfully modest man\r\nwho has been touched with the divine passion—especially when he would\r\nrather sink into the earth than betray himself by a single word or\r\nlook. Though Mr. Astley frequently met us when we were out walking, he\r\nwould merely take off his hat and pass us by, though I knew he was\r\ndying to join us. Even when invited to do so, he would refuse. Again,\r\nin places of amusement—in the Casino, at concerts, or near the\r\nfountain—he was never far from the spot where we were sitting. In fact,\r\n_wherever_ we were in the Park, in the forest, or on the\r\nShlangenberg—one needed but to raise one’s eyes and glance around to\r\ncatch sight of at least a _portion_ of Mr. Astley’s frame sticking\r\nout—whether on an adjacent path or behind a bush. Yet never did he lose\r\nany chance of speaking to myself; and, one morning when we had met, and\r\nexchanged a couple of words, he burst out in his usual abrupt way,\r\nwithout saying “Good-morning.”\r\n\r\n“That Mlle. Blanche,” he said. “Well, I have seen a good many women\r\nlike her.”\r\n\r\nAfter that he was silent as he looked me meaningly in the face. What he\r\nmeant I did not know, but to my glance of inquiry he returned only a\r\ndry nod, and a reiterated “It is so.” Presently, however, he resumed:\r\n\r\n“Does Mlle. Polina like flowers?”\r\n\r\n“I really cannot say,” was my reply. “What? You cannot say?” he cried in great astonishment. “No; I have never noticed whether she does so or not,” I repeated with\r\na smile. “Hm! Then I have an idea in my mind,” he concluded. Lastly, with a nod,\r\nhe walked away with a pleased expression on his face. The conversation\r\nhad been carried on in execrable French. IV\r\n\r\n\r\nToday has been a day of folly, stupidity, and ineptness. The time is\r\nnow eleven o’clock in the evening, and I am sitting in my room and\r\nthinking. It all began, this morning, with my being forced to go and\r\nplay roulette for Polina Alexandrovna. When she handed me over her\r\nstore of six hundred gülden I exacted two conditions—namely, that I\r\nshould not go halves with her in her winnings, if any (that is to say,\r\nI should not take anything for myself), and that she should explain to\r\nme, that same evening, why it was so necessary for her to win, and how\r\nmuch was the sum which she needed.", "sentences": ["Yet\r\nshe seemed to me almost destitute of education, and even of wits,\r\nthough cunning and suspicious.", "This, apparently, was not because her\r\nlife had been lacking in incident.", "Perhaps, if all were known, the\r\nMarquis was not her kinsman at all, nor her mother, her mother; but\r\nthere was evidence that, in Berlin, where we had first come across the\r\npair, they had possessed acquaintances of good standing.", "As for the\r\nMarquis himself, I doubt to this day if he was a Marquis—although about\r\nthe fact that he had formerly belonged to high society (for instance,\r\nin Moscow and Germany) there could be no doubt whatever.", "What he had\r\nformerly been in France I had not a notion.", "All I knew was that he was\r\nsaid to possess a château.", "During the last two weeks I had looked for\r\nmuch to transpire, but am still ignorant whether at that time anything\r\ndecisive ever passed between Mademoiselle and the General.", "Everything\r\nseemed to depend upon our means—upon whether the General would be able\r\nto flourish sufficient money in her face.", "If ever the news should\r\narrive that the grandmother was not dead, Mlle.", "Blanche, I felt sure,\r\nwould disappear in a twinkling.", "Indeed, it surprised and amused me to\r\nobserve what a passion for intrigue I was developing.", "But how I loathed\r\nit all!", "With what pleasure would I have given everybody and everything\r\nthe go-by!", "Only—I could not leave Polina.", "How, then, could I show\r\ncontempt for those who surrounded her?", "Espionage is a base thing,\r\nbut—what have I to do with that?", "Mr.", "Astley, too, I found a curious person.", "I was only sure that he had\r\nfallen in love with Polina.", "A remarkable and diverting circumstance is\r\nthe amount which may lie in the mien of a shy and painfully modest man\r\nwho has been touched with the divine passion—especially when he would\r\nrather sink into the earth than betray himself by a single word or\r\nlook.", "Though Mr.", "Astley frequently met us when we were out walking, he\r\nwould merely take off his hat and pass us by, though I knew he was\r\ndying to join us.", "Even when invited to do so, he would refuse.", "Again,\r\nin places of amusement—in the Casino, at concerts, or near the\r\nfountain—he was never far from the spot where we were sitting.", "In fact,\r\n_wherever_ we were in the Park, in the forest, or on the\r\nShlangenberg—one needed but to raise one’s eyes and glance around to\r\ncatch sight of at least a _portion_ of Mr.", "Astley’s frame sticking\r\nout—whether on an adjacent path or behind a bush.", "Yet never did he lose\r\nany chance of speaking to myself; and, one morning when we had met, and\r\nexchanged a couple of words, he burst out in his usual abrupt way,\r\nwithout saying “Good-morning.”\r\n\r\n“That Mlle.", "Blanche,” he said.", "“Well, I have seen a good many women\r\nlike her.”\r\n\r\nAfter that he was silent as he looked me meaningly in the face.", "What he\r\nmeant I did not know, but to my glance of inquiry he returned only a\r\ndry nod, and a reiterated “It is so.” Presently, however, he resumed:\r\n\r\n“Does Mlle.", "Polina like flowers?”\r\n\r\n“I really cannot say,” was my reply.", "“What?", "You cannot say?” he cried in great astonishment.", "“No; I have never noticed whether she does so or not,” I repeated with\r\na smile.", "“Hm!", "Then I have an idea in my mind,” he concluded.", "Lastly, with a nod,\r\nhe walked away with a pleased expression on his face.", "The conversation\r\nhad been carried on in execrable French.", "IV\r\n\r\n\r\nToday has been a day of folly, stupidity, and ineptness.", "The time is\r\nnow eleven o’clock in the evening, and I am sitting in my room and\r\nthinking.", "It all began, this morning, with my being forced to go and\r\nplay roulette for Polina Alexandrovna.", "When she handed me over her\r\nstore of six hundred gülden I exacted two conditions—namely, that I\r\nshould not go halves with her in her winnings, if any (that is to say,\r\nI should not take anything for myself), and that she should explain to\r\nme, that same evening, why it was so necessary for her to win, and how\r\nmuch was the sum which she needed."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_13", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 13)", "language": "de", "content": "For, I could not suppose that she\r\nwas doing all this merely for the sake of money. Yet clearly she _did_\r\nneed some money, and that as soon as possible, and for a special\r\npurpose. Well, she promised to explain matters, and I departed. There\r\nwas a tremendous crowd in the gaming-rooms. What an arrogant, greedy\r\ncrowd it was! I pressed forward towards the middle of the room until I\r\nhad secured a seat at a croupier’s elbow. Then I began to play in timid\r\nfashion, venturing only twenty or thirty gülden at a time. Meanwhile, I\r\nobserved and took notes. It seemed to me that calculation was\r\nsuperfluous, and by no means possessed of the importance which certain\r\nother players attached to it, even though they sat with ruled papers in\r\ntheir hands, whereon they set down the coups, calculated the chances,\r\nreckoned, staked, and—lost exactly as we more simple mortals did who\r\nplayed without any reckoning at all. However, I deduced from the scene one conclusion which seemed to me\r\nreliable—namely, that in the flow of fortuitous chances there is, if\r\nnot a system, at all events a sort of order. This, of course, is a very\r\nstrange thing. For instance, after a dozen middle figures there would\r\nalways occur a dozen or so outer ones. Suppose the ball stopped twice\r\nat a dozen outer figures; it would then pass to a dozen of the first\r\nones, and then, again, to a dozen of the middle ciphers, and fall upon\r\nthem three or four times, and then revert to a dozen outers; whence,\r\nafter another couple of rounds, the ball would again pass to the first\r\nfigures, strike upon them once, and then return thrice to the middle\r\nseries—continuing thus for an hour and a half, or two hours. One,\r\nthree, two: one, three, two. It was all very curious. Again, for the\r\nwhole of a day or a morning the red would alternate with the black, but\r\nalmost without any order, and from moment to moment, so that scarcely\r\ntwo consecutive rounds would end upon either the one or the other. Yet,\r\nnext day, or, perhaps, the next evening, the red alone would turn up,\r\nand attain a run of over two score, and continue so for quite a length\r\nof time—say, for a whole day. Of these circumstances the majority were\r\npointed out to me by Mr. Astley, who stood by the gaming-table the\r\nwhole morning, yet never once staked in person. For myself, I lost all that I had on me, and with great speed. To begin\r\nwith, I staked two hundred gülden on “even,” and won. Then I staked the\r\nsame amount again, and won: and so on some two or three times. At one\r\nmoment I must have had in my hands—gathered there within a space of\r\nfive minutes—about 4000 gülden. That, of course, was the proper moment\r\nfor me to have departed, but there arose in me a strange sensation as\r\nof a challenge to Fate—as of a wish to deal her a blow on the cheek,\r\nand to put out my tongue at her. Accordingly I set down the largest\r\nstake allowed by the rules—namely, 4000 gülden—and lost. Fired by this\r\nmishap, I pulled out all the money left to me, staked it all on the\r\nsame venture, and—again lost! Then I rose from the table, feeling as\r\nthough I were stupefied. What had happened to me I did not know; but,\r\nbefore luncheon I told Polina of my losses—until which time I walked\r\nabout the Park. At luncheon I was as excited as I had been at the meal three days ago. Mlle. Blanche and the Frenchman were lunching with us, and it appeared\r\nthat the former had been to the Casino that morning, and had seen my\r\nexploits there. So now she showed me more attention when talking to me;\r\nwhile, for his part, the Frenchman approached me, and asked outright if\r\nit had been my own money that I had lost. He appeared to be suspicious\r\nas to something being on foot between Polina and myself, but I merely\r\nfired up, and replied that the money had been all my own.", "sentences": ["For, I could not suppose that she\r\nwas doing all this merely for the sake of money.", "Yet clearly she _did_\r\nneed some money, and that as soon as possible, and for a special\r\npurpose.", "Well, she promised to explain matters, and I departed.", "There\r\nwas a tremendous crowd in the gaming-rooms.", "What an arrogant, greedy\r\ncrowd it was!", "I pressed forward towards the middle of the room until I\r\nhad secured a seat at a croupier’s elbow.", "Then I began to play in timid\r\nfashion, venturing only twenty or thirty gülden at a time.", "Meanwhile, I\r\nobserved and took notes.", "It seemed to me that calculation was\r\nsuperfluous, and by no means possessed of the importance which certain\r\nother players attached to it, even though they sat with ruled papers in\r\ntheir hands, whereon they set down the coups, calculated the chances,\r\nreckoned, staked, and—lost exactly as we more simple mortals did who\r\nplayed without any reckoning at all.", "However, I deduced from the scene one conclusion which seemed to me\r\nreliable—namely, that in the flow of fortuitous chances there is, if\r\nnot a system, at all events a sort of order.", "This, of course, is a very\r\nstrange thing.", "For instance, after a dozen middle figures there would\r\nalways occur a dozen or so outer ones.", "Suppose the ball stopped twice\r\nat a dozen outer figures; it would then pass to a dozen of the first\r\nones, and then, again, to a dozen of the middle ciphers, and fall upon\r\nthem three or four times, and then revert to a dozen outers; whence,\r\nafter another couple of rounds, the ball would again pass to the first\r\nfigures, strike upon them once, and then return thrice to the middle\r\nseries—continuing thus for an hour and a half, or two hours.", "One,\r\nthree, two: one, three, two.", "It was all very curious.", "Again, for the\r\nwhole of a day or a morning the red would alternate with the black, but\r\nalmost without any order, and from moment to moment, so that scarcely\r\ntwo consecutive rounds would end upon either the one or the other.", "Yet,\r\nnext day, or, perhaps, the next evening, the red alone would turn up,\r\nand attain a run of over two score, and continue so for quite a length\r\nof time—say, for a whole day.", "Of these circumstances the majority were\r\npointed out to me by Mr.", "Astley, who stood by the gaming-table the\r\nwhole morning, yet never once staked in person.", "For myself, I lost all that I had on me, and with great speed.", "To begin\r\nwith, I staked two hundred gülden on “even,” and won.", "Then I staked the\r\nsame amount again, and won: and so on some two or three times.", "At one\r\nmoment I must have had in my hands—gathered there within a space of\r\nfive minutes—about 4000 gülden.", "That, of course, was the proper moment\r\nfor me to have departed, but there arose in me a strange sensation as\r\nof a challenge to Fate—as of a wish to deal her a blow on the cheek,\r\nand to put out my tongue at her.", "Accordingly I set down the largest\r\nstake allowed by the rules—namely, 4000 gülden—and lost.", "Fired by this\r\nmishap, I pulled out all the money left to me, staked it all on the\r\nsame venture, and—again lost!", "Then I rose from the table, feeling as\r\nthough I were stupefied.", "What had happened to me I did not know; but,\r\nbefore luncheon I told Polina of my losses—until which time I walked\r\nabout the Park.", "At luncheon I was as excited as I had been at the meal three days ago.", "Mlle.", "Blanche and the Frenchman were lunching with us, and it appeared\r\nthat the former had been to the Casino that morning, and had seen my\r\nexploits there.", "So now she showed me more attention when talking to me;\r\nwhile, for his part, the Frenchman approached me, and asked outright if\r\nit had been my own money that I had lost.", "He appeared to be suspicious\r\nas to something being on foot between Polina and myself, but I merely\r\nfired up, and replied that the money had been all my own."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_14", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 14)", "language": "de", "content": "At this the General seemed extremely surprised, and asked me whence I\r\nhad procured it; whereupon I replied that, though I had begun only with\r\n100 gülden, six or seven rounds had increased my capital to 5000 or\r\n6000 gülden, and that subsequently I had lost the whole in two rounds. All this, of course, was plausible enough. During my recital I glanced\r\nat Polina, but nothing was to be discerned on her face. However, she\r\nhad allowed me to fire up without correcting me, and from that I\r\nconcluded that it was my _cue_ to fire up, and to conceal the fact that\r\nI had been playing on her behalf. “At all events,” I thought to myself,\r\n“she, in her turn, has promised to give me an explanation to-night, and\r\nto reveal to me something or another.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the General appeared to be taking stock of me, he said\r\nnothing. Yet I could see uneasiness and annoyance in his face. Perhaps\r\nhis straitened circumstances made it hard for him to have to hear of\r\npiles of gold passing through the hands of an irresponsible fool like\r\nmyself within the space of a quarter of an hour. Now, I have an idea\r\nthat, last night, he and the Frenchman had a sharp encounter with one\r\nanother. At all events they closeted themselves together, and then had\r\na long and vehement discussion; after which the Frenchman departed in\r\nwhat appeared to be a passion, but returned, early this morning, to\r\nrenew the combat. On hearing of my losses, however, he only remarked\r\nwith a sharp, and even a malicious, air that “a man ought to go more\r\ncarefully.” Next, for some reason or another, he added that, “though a\r\ngreat many Russians go in for gambling, they are no good at the game.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ think that roulette was devised specially for Russians,” I\r\nretorted; and when the Frenchman smiled contemptuously at my reply I\r\nfurther remarked that I was sure I was right; also that, speaking of\r\nRussians in the capacity of gamblers, I had far more blame for them\r\nthan praise—of that he could be quite sure. “Upon what do you base your opinion?” he inquired. “Upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised\r\nWesterner there has become historically added—though this is not his\r\nchief point—a capacity for acquiring capital; whereas, not only is the\r\nRussian incapable of acquiring capital, but also he exhausts it\r\nwantonly and of sheer folly. None the less we Russians often need\r\nmoney; wherefore, we are glad of, and greatly devoted to, a method of\r\nacquisition like roulette—whereby, in a couple of hours, one may grow\r\nrich without doing any work. This method, I repeat, has a great\r\nattraction for us, but since we play in wanton fashion, and without\r\ntaking any trouble, we almost invariably lose.”\r\n\r\n“To a certain extent that is true,” assented the Frenchman with a\r\nself-satisfied air. “Oh no, it is not true,” put in the General sternly. “And you,” he\r\nadded to me, “you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your\r\nown country!”\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon,” I said. “Yet it would be difficult to say which is the\r\nworst of the two—Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing\r\nrich through honest toil.”\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinary idea,” cried the General. “And what a _Russian_ idea!” added the Frenchman. I smiled, for I was rather glad to have a quarrel with them. “I would rather live a wandering life in tents,” I cried, “than bow the\r\nknee to a German idol!”\r\n\r\n“To _what_ idol?” exclaimed the General, now seriously angry. “To the German method of heaping up riches. I have not been here very\r\nlong, but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my\r\nTartar blood boil. Good Lord! I wish for no virtues of that kind. Yesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts; and, everywhere I\r\nfound that things were even as we read of them in good German\r\npicture-books—that every house has its ‘Vater,’ who is horribly\r\nbeneficent and extraordinarily honourable. So honourable is he that it\r\nis dreadful to have anything to do with him; and I cannot bear people\r\nof that sort.", "sentences": ["At this the General seemed extremely surprised, and asked me whence I\r\nhad procured it; whereupon I replied that, though I had begun only with\r\n100 gülden, six or seven rounds had increased my capital to 5000 or\r\n6000 gülden, and that subsequently I had lost the whole in two rounds.", "All this, of course, was plausible enough.", "During my recital I glanced\r\nat Polina, but nothing was to be discerned on her face.", "However, she\r\nhad allowed me to fire up without correcting me, and from that I\r\nconcluded that it was my _cue_ to fire up, and to conceal the fact that\r\nI had been playing on her behalf.", "“At all events,” I thought to myself,\r\n“she, in her turn, has promised to give me an explanation to-night, and\r\nto reveal to me something or another.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the General appeared to be taking stock of me, he said\r\nnothing.", "Yet I could see uneasiness and annoyance in his face.", "Perhaps\r\nhis straitened circumstances made it hard for him to have to hear of\r\npiles of gold passing through the hands of an irresponsible fool like\r\nmyself within the space of a quarter of an hour.", "Now, I have an idea\r\nthat, last night, he and the Frenchman had a sharp encounter with one\r\nanother.", "At all events they closeted themselves together, and then had\r\na long and vehement discussion; after which the Frenchman departed in\r\nwhat appeared to be a passion, but returned, early this morning, to\r\nrenew the combat.", "On hearing of my losses, however, he only remarked\r\nwith a sharp, and even a malicious, air that “a man ought to go more\r\ncarefully.” Next, for some reason or another, he added that, “though a\r\ngreat many Russians go in for gambling, they are no good at the game.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ think that roulette was devised specially for Russians,” I\r\nretorted; and when the Frenchman smiled contemptuously at my reply I\r\nfurther remarked that I was sure I was right; also that, speaking of\r\nRussians in the capacity of gamblers, I had far more blame for them\r\nthan praise—of that he could be quite sure.", "“Upon what do you base your opinion?” he inquired.", "“Upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised\r\nWesterner there has become historically added—though this is not his\r\nchief point—a capacity for acquiring capital; whereas, not only is the\r\nRussian incapable of acquiring capital, but also he exhausts it\r\nwantonly and of sheer folly.", "None the less we Russians often need\r\nmoney; wherefore, we are glad of, and greatly devoted to, a method of\r\nacquisition like roulette—whereby, in a couple of hours, one may grow\r\nrich without doing any work.", "This method, I repeat, has a great\r\nattraction for us, but since we play in wanton fashion, and without\r\ntaking any trouble, we almost invariably lose.”\r\n\r\n“To a certain extent that is true,” assented the Frenchman with a\r\nself-satisfied air.", "“Oh no, it is not true,” put in the General sternly.", "“And you,” he\r\nadded to me, “you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your\r\nown country!”\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon,” I said.", "“Yet it would be difficult to say which is the\r\nworst of the two—Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing\r\nrich through honest toil.”\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinary idea,” cried the General.", "“And what a _Russian_ idea!” added the Frenchman.", "I smiled, for I was rather glad to have a quarrel with them.", "“I would rather live a wandering life in tents,” I cried, “than bow the\r\nknee to a German idol!”\r\n\r\n“To _what_ idol?” exclaimed the General, now seriously angry.", "“To the German method of heaping up riches.", "I have not been here very\r\nlong, but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my\r\nTartar blood boil.", "Good Lord!", "I wish for no virtues of that kind.", "Yesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts; and, everywhere I\r\nfound that things were even as we read of them in good German\r\npicture-books—that every house has its ‘Vater,’ who is horribly\r\nbeneficent and extraordinarily honourable.", "So honourable is he that it\r\nis dreadful to have anything to do with him; and I cannot bear people\r\nof that sort."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_15", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 15)", "language": "de", "content": "Each such ‘Vater’ has his family, and in the evenings\r\nthey read improving books aloud. Over their roof-trees there murmur\r\nelms and chestnuts; the sun has sunk to his rest; a stork is roosting\r\non the gable; and all is beautifully poetic and touching. Do not be\r\nangry, General. Let me tell you something that is even more touching\r\nthan that. I can remember how, of an evening, my own father, now dead,\r\nused to sit under the lime trees in his little garden, and to read\r\nbooks aloud to myself and my mother. Yes, I know how things ought to be\r\ndone. Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to\r\nits ‘Vater.’ They work like oxen, and amass wealth like Jews. Suppose\r\nthe ‘Vater’ has put by a certain number of gülden which he hands over\r\nto his eldest son, in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a\r\nsmall plot of land. Well, one result is to deprive the daughter of a\r\ndowry, and so leave her among the unwedded. For the same reason, the\r\nparents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of\r\nthe army, in order that he may earn more towards the family capital. Yes, such things ARE done, for I have been making inquiries on the\r\nsubject. It is all done out of sheer rectitude—out of a rectitude which\r\nis magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been\r\n_rightly_ sold, and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice\r\nwhen he is made over into pledge. What more have I to tell? Well,\r\nthis—that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son. Perhaps he\r\nhas his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound; but he cannot marry her,\r\nfor the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient gülden. So, the\r\npair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation, and\r\nsmilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while. Gretchen’s cheeks grow\r\nsunken, and she begins to wither; until at last, after some twenty\r\nyears, their substance has multiplied, and sufficient gülden have been\r\nhonourably and virtuously accumulated. Then the ‘Vater’ blesses his\r\nforty-year-old heir and the thirty-five-year-old Gretchen with the\r\nsunken bosom and the scarlet nose; after which he bursts, into tears,\r\nreads the pair a lesson on morality, and dies. In turn the eldest son\r\nbecomes a virtuous ‘Vater,’ and the old story begins again. In fifty or\r\nsixty years’ time the grandson of the original ‘Vater’ will have\r\namassed a considerable sum; and that sum he will hand over to, his son,\r\nand the latter to _his_ son, and so on for several generations; until\r\nat length there will issue a Baron Rothschild, or a ‘Hoppe and\r\nCompany,’ or the devil knows what! Is it not a beautiful spectacle—the\r\nspectacle of a century or two of inherited labour, patience, intellect,\r\nrectitude, character, perseverance, and calculation, with a stork\r\nsitting on the roof above it all? What is more; they think there can\r\nnever be anything better than this; wherefore, from _their_ point of\r\nview they begin to judge the rest of the world, and to censure all who\r\nare at fault—that is to say, who are not exactly like themselves. Yes,\r\nthere you have it in a nutshell. For my own part, I would rather grow\r\nfat after the Russian manner, or squander my whole substance at\r\nroulette. I have no wish to be ‘Hoppe and Company’ at the end of five\r\ngenerations.

V\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, she had been extraordinarily meditative. Yet, on leaving the\r\ntable, she immediately ordered me to accompany her for a walk. We took\r\nthe children with us, and set out for the fountain in the Park. I was in such an irritated frame of mind that in rude and abrupt\r\nfashion I blurted out a question as to “why our Marquis de Griers had\r\nceased to accompany her for strolls, or to speak to her for days\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Because he is a brute,” she replied in rather a curious way.

Blanche,’” I remarked; “for\r\nin such an event she would never become Madame General. Do you know, I\r\nbelieve the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot\r\nhimself if she should throw him over. At his age it is a dangerous\r\nthing to fall in love.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, something, I believe, _will_ happen to him,” assented Polina\r\nthoughtfully. “And what a fine thing it all is!” I continued. “Could anything be more\r\nabominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money\r\nalone? Not one of the decencies has been observed; the whole affair has\r\ntaken place without the least ceremony. And as for the grandmother,\r\nwhat could be more comical, yet more dastardly, than the sending of\r\ntelegram after telegram to know if she is dead? What do you think of\r\nit, Polina Alexandrovna?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is very horrible,” she interrupted with a shudder. “Consequently, I am the more surprised that _you_ should be so\r\ncheerful.

I told you I should never\r\nwin for other people—least of all for you. I obeyed you simply because\r\nyou ordered me to; but you must not blame me for the result.

Moreover, it was I who lost your gülden.”\r\n\r\nShe glanced at me, but, seeing that I was in an irritable, sarcastic\r\nmood, changed the subject. “My affairs cannot possibly interest you,” she said. “Still, if you\r\n_do_ wish to know, I am in debt.

Were you joking? You cannot have\r\nbeen, for I remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the\r\nidea of your jesting.”\r\n\r\n“True,” I replied gloomily. “I always felt certain that I should win. Indeed, what you say makes me ask myself—Why have my absurd, senseless\r\nlosses of today raised a doubt in my mind? Yet I am _still_ positive\r\nthat, so soon as ever I begin to play for myself, I shall infallibly\r\nwin.”\r\n\r\n“And why are you so certain?”\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth, I do not know. I only know that I _must_ win—that\r\nit is the one resource I have left.

You are capable of worrying, but not deeply. You are too ill-regulated and unsettled a person for that. But why do\r\nyou want money? Not a single one of the reasons which you have given\r\ncan be looked upon as serious.”\r\n\r\n“By the way,” I interrupted, “you say you want to pay off a debt. It\r\nmust be a large one.

Surely you are not drunk?”\r\n\r\n“You know that you and I stand on no ceremony, and that sometimes I put\r\nto you very plain questions. I repeat that I am your slave—and slaves\r\ncannot be shamed or offended.”\r\n\r\n“You talk like a child. It is always possible to comport oneself with\r\ndignity. If one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to\r\ndegrade one.”\r\n\r\n“A maxim straight from the copybook! Suppose I _cannot_ comport myself\r\nwith dignity. By that I mean that, though I am a man of self-respect, I\r\nam unable to carry off a situation properly. Do you know the reason? It\r\nis because we Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be\r\nable at once to find the proper mode of expression. It is all a\r\nquestion of mode. Most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect\r\nas to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of\r\nbehaviour. And genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little\r\ngenius at all exists. It belongs only to the French—though a few other\r\nEuropeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure\r\nwith extreme dignity, and yet be wholly undignified persons. That is\r\nwhy, with us, the mode is so all-important. The Frenchman may receive\r\nan insult—a real, a venomous insult: yet, he will not so much as frown. But a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear, for the reason that such an\r\nact is an infringement of the accepted, of the time-hallowed order of\r\ndecorum. That is why our good ladies are so fond of Frenchmen—the\r\nFrenchman’s manners, they say, are perfect! But in my opinion there is\r\nno such thing as a Frenchman’s manners. The Frenchman is only a\r\nbird—the _coq gaulois_. At the same time, as I am not a woman, I do not\r\nproperly understand the question. Cocks may be excellent birds. If I am\r\nwrong you must stop me. You ought to stop and correct me more often\r\nwhen I am speaking to you, for I am too apt to say everything that is\r\nin my head. “You see, I have lost my manners.

Everything in me has undergone a cheek. You know the reason. I have not\r\na single human thought in my head. For a long while I have been\r\nignorant of what is going on in the world—here or in Russia. I have\r\nbeen to Dresden, yet am completely in the dark as to what Dresden is\r\nlike. You know the cause of my obsession. I have no hope now, and am a\r\nmere cipher in your eyes; wherefore, I tell you outright that wherever\r\nI go I see only you—all the rest is a matter of indifference. “Why or how I have come to love you I do not know. It may be that you\r\nare not altogether fair to look upon. Do you know, I am ignorant even\r\nas to what your face is like. In all probability, too, your heart is\r\nnot comely, and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble.”\r\n\r\n“And because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to\r\npurchase me with money?” she said. “_When_ have I thought to do so?” was my reply. “You are losing the thread of the argument. If you do not wish to\r\npurchase me, at all events you wish to purchase my respect.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I have told you that I find it difficult to explain\r\nmyself. You are hard upon me. Do not be angry at my chattering. You\r\nknow why you ought not to be angry with me—that I am simply an\r\nimbecile. However, I do not mind if you _are_ angry. Sitting in my\r\nroom, I need but to think of you, to imagine to myself the rustle of\r\nyour dress, and at once I fall almost to biting my hands. Why should\r\nyou be angry with me? Because I call myself your slave? Revel, I pray\r\nyou, in my slavery—revel in it. Do you know that sometimes I could kill\r\nyou?—not because I do not love you, or am jealous of you, but, because\r\nI feel as though I could simply devour you... You are laughing!”\r\n\r\n“No, I am not,” she retorted. “But I order you, nevertheless, to be\r\nsilent.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped, well nigh breathless with anger. God knows, she may not\r\nhave been a beautiful woman, yet I loved to see her come to a halt like\r\nthis, and was therefore, the more fond of arousing her temper. Perhaps\r\nshe divined this, and for that very reason gave way to rage. I said as\r\nmuch to her. “What rubbish!” she cried with a shudder. “I do not care,” I continued. “Also, do you know that it is not safe\r\nfor us to take walks together? Often I have a feeling that I should\r\nlike to strike you, to disfigure you, to strangle you. Are you certain\r\nthat it will never come to that? You are driving me to frenzy. Am I\r\nafraid of a scandal, or of your anger? Why should I fear your anger? I\r\nlove without hope, and know that hereafter I shall love you a thousand\r\ntimes more. If ever I should kill you I should have to kill myself too. But I shall put off doing so as long as possible, for I wish to\r\ncontinue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me. Do\r\nyou know a very strange thing? It is that, with every day, my love for\r\nyou increases—though that would seem to be almost an impossibility. Why\r\nshould I not become a fatalist? Remember how, on the third day that we\r\nascended the Shlangenberg, I was moved to whisper in your ear: ‘Say but\r\nthe word, and I will leap into the abyss.’ Had you said it, I should\r\nhave leapt. Do you not believe me?”\r\n\r\n“What stupid rubbish!” she cried. “I care not whether it be wise or stupid,” I cried in return. “I only\r\nknow that in your presence I must speak, speak, speak.

The\r\nfact is that my face must have been expressing all the maze of\r\nsenseless, gross sensations which were seething within me. To this day\r\nI can remember, word for word, the conversation as I have written it\r\ndown. My eyes were suffused with blood, and the foam had caked itself\r\non my lips. Also, on my honour I swear that, had she bidden me cast\r\nmyself from the summit of the Shlangenberg, I should have done it. Yes,\r\nhad she bidden me in jest, or only in contempt and with a spit in my\r\nface, I should have cast myself down. “Oh no! Why so? I believe you,” she said, but in such a manner—in the\r\nmanner of which, at times, she was a mistress—and with such a note of\r\ndisdain and viperish arrogance in her tone, that God knows I could have\r\nkilled her. Yes, at that moment she stood in peril. I had not lied to her about\r\nthat. “Surely you are not a coward?” suddenly she asked me. “I do not know,” I replied. “Perhaps I am, but I do not know. I have\r\nlong given up thinking about such things.”\r\n\r\n“If I said to you, ‘Kill that man,’ would you kill him?”\r\n\r\n“Whom?”\r\n\r\n“Whomsoever I wish?”\r\n\r\n“The Frenchman?”\r\n\r\n“Do not ask me questions; return me answers. I repeat, whomsoever I\r\nwish? I desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now.”\r\n\r\nShe awaited my reply with such gravity and impatience that I found the\r\nsituation unpleasant. “Do _you_, rather, tell me,” I said, “what is going on here? Why do you\r\nseem half-afraid of me? I can see for myself what is wrong. You are the\r\nstep-daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love\r\nfor this devil of a Blanche. And there is this Frenchman, too, with his\r\nmysterious influence over you. Yet, you actually ask me such a\r\nquestion! If you do not tell me how things stand, I shall have to put\r\nin my oar and do something. Are you ashamed to be frank with me? Are\r\nyou shy of me?”\r\n\r\n“I am not going to talk to you on that subject. I have asked you a\r\nquestion, and am waiting for an answer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then—I will kill whomsoever you wish,” I said. “But are you\r\n_really_ going to bid me do such deeds?”\r\n\r\n“Why should you think that I am going to let you off? I shall bid you\r\ndo it, or else renounce me. Could you ever do the latter? No, you know\r\nthat you couldn’t. You would first kill whom I had bidden you, and then\r\nkill _me_ for having dared to send you away!”\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to strike upon my brain as I heard these words. Of\r\ncourse, at the time I took them half in jest and half as a challenge;\r\nyet, she had spoken them with great seriousness. I felt thunderstruck\r\nthat she should so express herself, that she should assert such a right\r\nover me, that she should assume such authority and say outright:\r\n“Either you kill whom I bid you, or I will have nothing more to do with\r\nyou.” Indeed, in what she had said there was something so cynical and\r\nunveiled as to pass all bounds. For how could she ever regard me as the\r\nsame after the killing was done? This was more than slavery and\r\nabasement; it was sufficient to bring a man back to his right senses. Yet, despite the outrageous improbability of our conversation, my heart\r\nshook within me. Suddenly, she burst out laughing. We were seated on a bench near the\r\nspot where the children were playing—just opposite the point in the\r\nalley-way before the Casino where the carriages drew up in order to set\r\ndown their occupants. “Do you see that fat Baroness?” she cried. “It is the Baroness\r\nBurmergelm.

Go, for such is my will.”\r\n\r\n“Then I _will_ go, however mad be your fancy.

Do I not know that what I\r\nhave asked you to do is foolish and wrong, and that the General will be\r\nangry about it? But I want to have a good laugh, all the same. I want\r\nthat, and nothing else. Why should you insult a woman, indeed? Well,\r\nyou will be given a sound thrashing for so doing.”\r\n\r\nI turned away, and went silently to do her bidding. Of course the thing\r\nwas folly, but I could not get out of it. I remember that, as I\r\napproached the Baroness, I felt as excited as a schoolboy. I was in a\r\nfrenzy, as though I were drunk. VI\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days have passed since that day of lunacy. What a noise and a fuss\r\nand a chattering and an uproar there was! And what a welter of\r\nunseemliness and disorder and stupidity and bad manners! And _I_ the\r\ncause of it all! Yet part of the scene was also ridiculous—at all\r\nevents to myself it was so. I am not quite sure what was the matter\r\nwith me—whether I was merely stupefied or whether I purposely broke\r\nloose and ran amok. At times my mind seems all confused; while at other\r\ntimes I seem almost to be back in my childhood, at the school desk, and\r\nto have done the deed simply out of mischief. It all came of Polina—yes, of Polina. But for her, there might never\r\nhave been a fracas. Or perhaps I did the deed in a fit of despair\r\n(though it may be foolish of me to think so)? What there is so\r\nattractive about her I cannot think. Yet there _is_ something\r\nattractive about her—something passing fair, it would seem. Others\r\nbesides myself she has driven to distraction. She is tall and straight,\r\nand very slim. Her body looks as though it could be tied into a knot,\r\nor bent double, like a cord. The imprint of her foot is long and\r\nnarrow. It is, a maddening imprint—yes, simply a maddening one! And her\r\nhair has a reddish tint about it, and her eyes are like cat’s\r\neyes—though able also to glance with proud, disdainful mien. On the\r\nevening of my first arrival, four months ago, I remember that she was\r\nsitting and holding an animated conversation with De Griers in the\r\nsalon. And the way in which she looked at him was such that later, when\r\nI retired to my own room upstairs, I kept fancying that she had smitten\r\nhim in the face—that she had smitten him right on the cheek, so\r\npeculiar had been her look as she stood confronting him. Ever since\r\nthat evening I have loved her. But to my tale. I stepped from the path into the carriage-way, and took my stand in the\r\nmiddle of it. There I awaited the Baron and the Baroness. When they\r\nwere but a few paces distant from me I took off my hat, and bowed. I remember that the Baroness was clad in a voluminous silk dress, pale\r\ngrey in colour, and adorned with flounces and a crinoline and train. Also, she was short and inordinately stout, while her gross, flabby\r\nchin completely concealed her neck. Her face was purple, and the little\r\neyes in it had an impudent, malicious expression.", "sentences": ["Well, go to the Baroness,\r\ntake off your hat to her, and say something in French.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because you have sworn that you would leap from the Shlangenberg for\r\nmy sake, and that you would kill any one whom I might bid you kill.", "Well, instead of such murders and tragedies, I wish only for a good\r\nlaugh.", "Go without answering me, and let me see the Baron give you a\r\nsound thrashing with his stick.”\r\n\r\n“Then you throw me out a challenge?—you think that I will not do it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do challenge you.", "Go, for such is my will.”\r\n\r\n“Then I _will_ go, however mad be your fancy.", "Only, look here: shall\r\nyou not be doing the General a great disservice, as well as, through\r\nhim, a great disservice to yourself?", "It is not about myself I am\r\nworrying—it is about you and the General.", "Why, for a mere fancy, should\r\nI go and insult a woman?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!", "Then I can see that you are only a trifler,” she said\r\ncontemptuously.", "“Your eyes are swimming with blood—but only because you\r\nhave drunk a little too much at luncheon.", "Do I not know that what I\r\nhave asked you to do is foolish and wrong, and that the General will be\r\nangry about it?", "But I want to have a good laugh, all the same.", "I want\r\nthat, and nothing else.", "Why should you insult a woman, indeed?", "Well,\r\nyou will be given a sound thrashing for so doing.”\r\n\r\nI turned away, and went silently to do her bidding.", "Of course the thing\r\nwas folly, but I could not get out of it.", "I remember that, as I\r\napproached the Baroness, I felt as excited as a schoolboy.", "I was in a\r\nfrenzy, as though I were drunk.", "VI\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days have passed since that day of lunacy.", "What a noise and a fuss\r\nand a chattering and an uproar there was!", "And what a welter of\r\nunseemliness and disorder and stupidity and bad manners!", "And _I_ the\r\ncause of it all!", "Yet part of the scene was also ridiculous—at all\r\nevents to myself it was so.", "I am not quite sure what was the matter\r\nwith me—whether I was merely stupefied or whether I purposely broke\r\nloose and ran amok.", "At times my mind seems all confused; while at other\r\ntimes I seem almost to be back in my childhood, at the school desk, and\r\nto have done the deed simply out of mischief.", "It all came of Polina—yes, of Polina.", "But for her, there might never\r\nhave been a fracas.", "Or perhaps I did the deed in a fit of despair\r\n(though it may be foolish of me to think so)?", "What there is so\r\nattractive about her I cannot think.", "Yet there _is_ something\r\nattractive about her—something passing fair, it would seem.", "Others\r\nbesides myself she has driven to distraction.", "She is tall and straight,\r\nand very slim.", "Her body looks as though it could be tied into a knot,\r\nor bent double, like a cord.", "The imprint of her foot is long and\r\nnarrow.", "It is, a maddening imprint—yes, simply a maddening one!", "And her\r\nhair has a reddish tint about it, and her eyes are like cat’s\r\neyes—though able also to glance with proud, disdainful mien.", "On the\r\nevening of my first arrival, four months ago, I remember that she was\r\nsitting and holding an animated conversation with De Griers in the\r\nsalon.", "And the way in which she looked at him was such that later, when\r\nI retired to my own room upstairs, I kept fancying that she had smitten\r\nhim in the face—that she had smitten him right on the cheek, so\r\npeculiar had been her look as she stood confronting him.", "Ever since\r\nthat evening I have loved her.", "But to my tale.", "I stepped from the path into the carriage-way, and took my stand in the\r\nmiddle of it.", "There I awaited the Baron and the Baroness.", "When they\r\nwere but a few paces distant from me I took off my hat, and bowed.", "I remember that the Baroness was clad in a voluminous silk dress, pale\r\ngrey in colour, and adorned with flounces and a crinoline and train.", "Also, she was short and inordinately stout, while her gross, flabby\r\nchin completely concealed her neck.", "Her face was purple, and the little\r\neyes in it had an impudent, malicious expression."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_21", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 21)", "language": "de", "content": "Yet she walked as\r\nthough she were conferring a favour upon everybody by so doing. As for\r\nthe Baron, he was tall, wizened, bony-faced after the German fashion,\r\nspectacled, and, apparently, about forty-five years of age. Also, he\r\nhad legs which seemed to begin almost at his chest—or, rather, at his\r\nchin! Yet, for all his air of peacock-like conceit, his clothes sagged\r\na little, and his face wore a sheepish air which might have passed for\r\nprofundity. These details I noted within a space of a few seconds. At first my bow and the fact that I had my hat in my hand barely caught\r\ntheir attention. The Baron only scowled a little, and the Baroness\r\nswept straight on. “Madame la Baronne,” said I, loudly and distinctly—embroidering each\r\nword, as it were—“j’ai l’honneur d’être votre esclave.”\r\n\r\nThen I bowed again, put on my hat, and walked past the Baron with a\r\nrude smile on my face. Polina had ordered me merely to take off my hat: the bow and the\r\ngeneral effrontery were of my own invention. God knows what instigated\r\nme to perpetrate the outrage! In my frenzy I felt as though I were\r\nwalking on air. “Hein!” ejaculated—or, rather, growled—the Baron as he turned towards\r\nme in angry surprise. I too turned round, and stood waiting in pseudo-courteous expectation. Yet still I wore on my face an impudent smile as I gazed at him. He\r\nseemed to hesitate, and his brows contracted to their utmost limits. Every moment his visage was growing darker. The Baroness also turned in\r\nmy direction, and gazed at me in wrathful perplexity, while some of the\r\npassers-by also began to stare at us, and others of them halted\r\noutright. “Hein!” the Baron vociferated again, with a redoubled growl and a note\r\nof growing wrath in his voice. “Ja wohl!” I replied, still looking him in the eyes. “Sind Sie rasend?” he exclaimed, brandishing his stick, and,\r\napparently, beginning to feel nervous. Perhaps it was my costume which\r\nintimidated him, for I was well and fashionably dressed, after the\r\nmanner of a man who belongs to indisputably good society. “Ja wo-o-ohl!” cried I again with all my might with a longdrawn rolling\r\nof the “ohl” sound after the fashion of the Berliners (who constantly\r\nuse the phrase “Ja wohl!” in conversation, and more or less prolong the\r\nsyllable “ohl” according as they desire to express different shades of\r\nmeaning or of mood). At this the Baron and the Baroness faced sharply about, and almost fled\r\nin their alarm. Some of the bystanders gave vent to excited\r\nexclamations, and others remained staring at me in astonishment. But I\r\ndo not remember the details very well. Wheeling quietly about, I returned in the direction of Polina\r\nAlexandrovna. But, when I had got within a hundred paces of her seat, I\r\nsaw her rise and set out with the children towards the hotel. At the portico I caught up to her. “I have perpetrated the—the piece of idiocy,” I said as I came level\r\nwith her. “Have you? Then you can take the consequences,” she replied without so\r\nmuch as looking at me. Then she moved towards the staircase. I spent the rest of the evening walking in the park. Thence I passed\r\ninto the forest, and walked on until I found myself in a neighbouring\r\nprincipality. At a wayside restaurant I partook of an omelette and some\r\nwine, and was charged for the idyllic repast a thaler and a half. Not until eleven o’clock did I return home—to find a summons awaiting\r\nme from the General. Our party occupied two suites in the hotel; each of which contained two\r\nrooms. The first (the larger suite) comprised a salon and a\r\nsmoking-room, with, adjoining the latter, the General’s study. It was\r\nhere that he was awaiting me as he stood posed in a majestic attitude\r\nbeside his writing-table. Lolling on a divan close by was De Griers. “My good sir,” the General began, “may I ask you what this is that you\r\nhave gone and done?”\r\n\r\n“I should be glad,” I replied, “if we could come straight to the point.", "sentences": ["Yet she walked as\r\nthough she were conferring a favour upon everybody by so doing.", "As for\r\nthe Baron, he was tall, wizened, bony-faced after the German fashion,\r\nspectacled, and, apparently, about forty-five years of age.", "Also, he\r\nhad legs which seemed to begin almost at his chest—or, rather, at his\r\nchin!", "Yet, for all his air of peacock-like conceit, his clothes sagged\r\na little, and his face wore a sheepish air which might have passed for\r\nprofundity.", "These details I noted within a space of a few seconds.", "At first my bow and the fact that I had my hat in my hand barely caught\r\ntheir attention.", "The Baron only scowled a little, and the Baroness\r\nswept straight on.", "“Madame la Baronne,” said I, loudly and distinctly—embroidering each\r\nword, as it were—“j’ai l’honneur d’être votre esclave.”\r\n\r\nThen I bowed again, put on my hat, and walked past the Baron with a\r\nrude smile on my face.", "Polina had ordered me merely to take off my hat: the bow and the\r\ngeneral effrontery were of my own invention.", "God knows what instigated\r\nme to perpetrate the outrage!", "In my frenzy I felt as though I were\r\nwalking on air.", "“Hein!” ejaculated—or, rather, growled—the Baron as he turned towards\r\nme in angry surprise.", "I too turned round, and stood waiting in pseudo-courteous expectation.", "Yet still I wore on my face an impudent smile as I gazed at him.", "He\r\nseemed to hesitate, and his brows contracted to their utmost limits.", "Every moment his visage was growing darker.", "The Baroness also turned in\r\nmy direction, and gazed at me in wrathful perplexity, while some of the\r\npassers-by also began to stare at us, and others of them halted\r\noutright.", "“Hein!” the Baron vociferated again, with a redoubled growl and a note\r\nof growing wrath in his voice.", "“Ja wohl!” I replied, still looking him in the eyes.", "“Sind Sie rasend?” he exclaimed, brandishing his stick, and,\r\napparently, beginning to feel nervous.", "Perhaps it was my costume which\r\nintimidated him, for I was well and fashionably dressed, after the\r\nmanner of a man who belongs to indisputably good society.", "“Ja wo-o-ohl!” cried I again with all my might with a longdrawn rolling\r\nof the “ohl” sound after the fashion of the Berliners (who constantly\r\nuse the phrase “Ja wohl!” in conversation, and more or less prolong the\r\nsyllable “ohl” according as they desire to express different shades of\r\nmeaning or of mood).", "At this the Baron and the Baroness faced sharply about, and almost fled\r\nin their alarm.", "Some of the bystanders gave vent to excited\r\nexclamations, and others remained staring at me in astonishment.", "But I\r\ndo not remember the details very well.", "Wheeling quietly about, I returned in the direction of Polina\r\nAlexandrovna.", "But, when I had got within a hundred paces of her seat, I\r\nsaw her rise and set out with the children towards the hotel.", "At the portico I caught up to her.", "“I have perpetrated the—the piece of idiocy,” I said as I came level\r\nwith her.", "“Have you?", "Then you can take the consequences,” she replied without so\r\nmuch as looking at me.", "Then she moved towards the staircase.", "I spent the rest of the evening walking in the park.", "Thence I passed\r\ninto the forest, and walked on until I found myself in a neighbouring\r\nprincipality.", "At a wayside restaurant I partook of an omelette and some\r\nwine, and was charged for the idyllic repast a thaler and a half.", "Not until eleven o’clock did I return home—to find a summons awaiting\r\nme from the General.", "Our party occupied two suites in the hotel; each of which contained two\r\nrooms.", "The first (the larger suite) comprised a salon and a\r\nsmoking-room, with, adjoining the latter, the General’s study.", "It was\r\nhere that he was awaiting me as he stood posed in a majestic attitude\r\nbeside his writing-table.", "Lolling on a divan close by was De Griers.", "“My good sir,” the General began, “may I ask you what this is that you\r\nhave gone and done?”\r\n\r\n“I should be glad,” I replied, “if we could come straight to the point."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_22", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 22)", "language": "de", "content": "Probably you are referring to my encounter of today with a German?”\r\n\r\n“With a German?

But the Baron and Baroness are\r\nmembers of an older generation, as well as Prussian Junkers and\r\nlandowners.

Any intercourse with you, even though it be\r\nconfined to a begging of their pardons, they would look upon as a\r\ndegradation. I may tell you that, on learning that you formed part of\r\nmy household, the Baron approached me in the Casino, and demanded of me\r\nadditional satisfaction. Do you understand, then, what it is that you\r\nhave entailed upon me—upon _me_, my good sir?

Also I have the honour to remain your obedient\r\nservant.”\r\n\r\nI took the money and the account (which was indicted in pencil), and,\r\nbowing low to the General, said to him very gravely:\r\n\r\n“The matter cannot end here. I regret very much that you should have\r\nbeen put to unpleasantness at the Baron’s hands; but, the fault (pardon\r\nme) is your own. How came you to answer for me to the Baron? And what\r\ndid you mean by saying that I formed part of your household? I am\r\nmerely your family tutor—not a son of yours, nor yet your ward, nor a\r\nperson of any kind for whose acts you need be responsible. I am a\r\njudicially competent person, a man of twenty-five years of age, a\r\nuniversity graduate, a gentleman, and, until I met yourself, a complete\r\nstranger to you.

The Frenchman laughed aloud. “Nor do I intend to let the Baron off,” I continued calmly, but with\r\nnot a little discomfiture at De Griers’ merriment. “And since you,\r\nGeneral, have today been so good as to listen to the Baron’s\r\ncomplaints, and to enter into his concerns—since you have made yourself\r\na participator in the affair—I have the honour to inform you that,\r\ntomorrow morning at the latest, I shall, in my own name, demand of the\r\nsaid Baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which have led him to\r\ndisregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself alone,\r\nand to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person, as\r\nthough I were unworthy to answer for my own conduct.”\r\n\r\nThen there happened what I had foreseen. The General on hearing of this\r\nfurther intended outrage, showed the white feather. “What?” he cried. “Do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense? Do\r\nyou not realise the harm that it is doing me? I beg of you not to laugh\r\nat me, sir—not to laugh at me, for we have police authorities here who,\r\nout of respect for my rank, and for that of the Baron... In short, sir,\r\nI swear to you that I will have you arrested, and marched out of the\r\nplace, to prevent any further brawling on your part.

I have not\r\nso much as begun my explanations to the Baron, and you are altogether\r\nignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely\r\nto assume. I wish but to disabuse the Baron of what is, to me, a\r\nshameful supposition—namely, that I am under the guardianship of a\r\nperson who is qualified to exercise control over my free will. It is\r\nvain for you to disturb and alarm yourself.”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Alexis Ivanovitch, do put an end to this senseless\r\nscheme of yours!” he muttered, but with a sudden change from a\r\ntruculent tone to one of entreaty as he caught me by the hand. “Do you\r\nknow what is likely to come of it? Merely further unpleasantness. You\r\nwill agree with me, I am sure, that at present I ought to move with\r\nespecial care—yes, with very especial care. You cannot be fully aware\r\nof how I am situated. When we leave this place I shall be ready to\r\nreceive you back into my household; but, for the time being I— Well, I\r\ncannot tell you all my reasons.” With that he wound up in a despairing\r\nvoice: “O Alexis Ivanovitch, Alexis Ivanovitch!”\r\n\r\nI moved towards the door—begging him to be calm, and promising that\r\neverything should be done decently and in order; whereafter I departed. Russians, when abroad, are over-apt to play the poltroon, to watch all\r\ntheir words, and to wonder what people are thinking of their conduct,\r\nor whether such and such a thing is _comme il faut_. In short, they are\r\nover-apt to cosset themselves, and to lay claim to great importance. Always they prefer the form of behaviour which has once and for all\r\nbecome accepted and established. This they will follow slavishly\r\nwhether in hotels, on promenades, at meetings, or when on a journey. But the General had avowed to me that, over and above such\r\nconsiderations as these, there were circumstances which compelled him\r\nto “move with especial care at present”, and that the fact had actually\r\nmade him poor-spirited and a coward—it had made him altogether change\r\nhis tone towards me. This fact I took into my calculations, and duly\r\nnoted it, for, of course, he _might_ apply to the authorities tomorrow,\r\nand it behoved me to go carefully. Yet it was not the General but Polina that I wanted to anger. She had\r\ntreated me with such cruelty, and had got me into such a hole, that I\r\nfelt a longing to force her to beseech me to stop. Of course, my\r\ntomfoolery might compromise her; yet certain other feelings and desires\r\nhad begun to form themselves in my brain. If I was never to rank in her\r\neyes as anything but a nonentity, it would not greatly matter if I\r\nfigured as a draggle-tailed cockerel, and the Baron were to give me a\r\ngood thrashing; but, the fact was that I desired to have the laugh of\r\nthem all, and to come out myself unscathed. Let people see what they\r\n_would_ see. Let Polina, for once, have a good fright, and be forced to\r\nwhistle me to heel again. But, however much she might whistle, she\r\nshould see that I was at least no draggle-tailed cockerel! I have just received a surprising piece of news. I have just met our\r\nchambermaid on the stairs, and been informed by her that Maria\r\nPhilipovna departed today, by the night train, to stay with a cousin at\r\nCarlsbad. What can that mean? The maid declares that Madame packed her\r\ntrunks early in the day. Yet how is it that no one else seems to have\r\nbeen aware of the circumstance?

It\r\nwas a curious fact, that, though I had not yet won anything at play, I\r\nnevertheless acted, thought, and felt as though I were sure, before\r\nlong, to become wealthy—since I could not imagine myself otherwise. Next, I bethought me, despite the earliness of the hour, of going to\r\nsee Mr. Astley, who was staying at the Hôtel de l’Angleterre (a\r\nhostelry at no great distance from our own). But suddenly De Griers\r\nentered my room. This had never before happened, for of late that\r\ngentleman and I had stood on the most strained and distant of terms—he\r\nattempting no concealment of his contempt for me (he even made an\r\nexpress point of showing it), and I having no reason to desire his\r\ncompany. In short, I detested him. Consequently, his entry at the\r\npresent moment the more astounded me. At once I divined that something\r\nout of the way was on the carpet. He entered with marked affability, and began by complimenting me on my\r\nroom. Then, perceiving that I had my hat in my hands, he inquired\r\nwhither I was going so early; and, no sooner did he hear that I was\r\nbound for Mr. Astley’s than he stopped, looked grave, and seemed\r\nplunged in thought. He was a true Frenchman insofar as that, though he could be lively and\r\nengaging when it suited him, he became insufferably dull and wearisome\r\nas soon as ever the need for being lively and engaging had passed. Seldom is a Frenchman _naturally_ civil: he is civil only as though to\r\norder and of set purpose. Also, if he thinks it incumbent upon him to\r\nbe fanciful, original, and out of the way, his fancy always assumes a\r\nfoolish, unnatural vein, for the reason that it is compounded of trite,\r\nhackneyed forms. In short, the natural Frenchman is a conglomeration of\r\ncommonplace, petty, everyday positiveness, so that he is the most\r\ntedious person in the world. Indeed, I believe that none but greenhorns\r\nand excessively Russian people feel an attraction towards the French;\r\nfor, to any man of sensibility, such a compendium of outworn forms—a\r\ncompendium which is built up of drawing-room manners, expansiveness,\r\nand gaiety—becomes at once over-noticeable and unbearable. “I have come to see you on business,” De Griers began in a very\r\noff-hand, yet polite, tone; “nor will I seek to conceal from you the\r\nfact that I have come in the capacity of an emissary, of an\r\nintermediary, from the General. Having small knowledge of the Russian\r\ntongue, I lost most of what was said last night; but, the General has\r\nnow explained matters, and I must confess that—”\r\n\r\n“See here, Monsieur de Griers,” I interrupted. “I understand that you\r\nhave undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary. Of course I\r\nam only ‘un utchitel,’ a tutor, and have never claimed to be an\r\nintimate of this household, nor to stand on at all familiar terms with\r\nit. Consequently, I do not know the whole of its circumstances. Yet\r\npray explain to me this: have you yourself become one of its members,\r\nseeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything, and\r\nare now present as an intermediary?”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman seemed not over-pleased at my question. It was one which\r\nwas too outspoken for his taste—and he had no mind to be frank with me. “I am connected with the General,” he said drily, “partly through\r\nbusiness affairs, and partly through special circumstances. My\r\nprincipal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of\r\nlast evening. What you contemplate is, I have no doubt, very clever;\r\nyet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the\r\nslightest chance of succeeding in your end, since not only will the\r\nBaron refuse to receive you, but also he (the Baron) has at his\r\ndisposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from\r\nyou.

In short, he adopted a supercilious\r\nattitude. For my own part, I endeavoured to pretend that I took the\r\naffair very seriously. I declared that, since the Baron had gone and\r\ncomplained of me to the General, as though I were a mere servant of the\r\nGeneral’s, he had, in the first place, lost me my post, and, in the\r\nsecond place, treated me like a person to whom, as to one not qualified\r\nto answer for himself, it was not even worth while to speak. Naturally,\r\nI said, I felt insulted at this. Yet, comprehending as I did,\r\ndifferences of years, of social status, and so forth (here I could\r\nscarcely help smiling), I was not anxious to bring about further scenes\r\nby going personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the Baron. All that I felt was that I had a right to go in person and beg the\r\nBaron’s and the Baroness’s pardon—the more so since, of late, I had\r\nbeen feeling unwell and unstrung, and had been in a fanciful condition. And so forth, and so forth. Yet (I continued) the Baron’s offensive\r\nbehaviour to me of yesterday (that is to say, the fact of his referring\r\nthe matter to the General) as well as his insistence that the General\r\nshould deprive me of my post, had placed me in such a position that I\r\ncould not well express my regret to him (the Baron) and to his good\r\nlady, for the reason that in all probability both he and the Baroness,\r\nwith the world at large, would imagine that I was doing so merely\r\nbecause I hoped, by my action, to recover my post. Hence, I found\r\nmyself forced to request the Baron to express to me _his own_ regrets,\r\nas well as to express them in the most unqualified manner—to say, in\r\nfact, that he had never had any wish to insult me. After the Baron had\r\ndone _that_, I should, for my part, at once feel free to express to\r\nhim, whole-heartedly and without reserve, my own regrets. “In short,” I\r\ndeclared in conclusion, “my one desire is that the Baron may make it\r\npossible for me to adopt the latter course.”\r\n\r\n“Oh fie! What refinements and subtleties!” exclaimed De Griers. “Besides, what have you to express regret for? Confess, Monsieur,\r\nMonsieur—pardon me, but I have forgotten your name—confess, I say, that\r\nall this is merely a plan to annoy the General? Or perhaps, you have\r\nsome other and special end in view? Eh?”\r\n\r\n“In return you must pardon _me_, mon cher Marquis, and tell me what\r\n_you_ have to do with it.”\r\n\r\n“The General—”\r\n\r\n“But what of the General? Last night he said that, for some reason or\r\nanother, it behoved him to ‘move with especial care at present;’\r\nwherefore, he was feeling nervous. But I did not understand the\r\nreference.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there _do_ exist special reasons for his doing so,” assented De\r\nGriers in a conciliatory tone, yet with rising anger. “You are\r\nacquainted with Mlle. de Cominges, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“Mlle. Blanche, you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mlle. Blanche de Cominges.", "sentences": ["What, then, would be the good of\r\ngoing on with it all?", "On the other hand, the General promises that at\r\nthe first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his\r\nhousehold, and, in the meantime, will credit you with your salary—with\r\n‘vos appointements.’ Surely that will suit you, will it not?”\r\n\r\nVery quietly I replied that he (the Frenchman) was labouring under a\r\ndelusion; that perhaps, after all, I should not be expelled from the\r\nBaron’s presence, but, on the contrary, be listened to; finally, that I\r\nshould be glad if Monsieur de Griers would confess that he was now\r\nvisiting me merely in order to see how far I intended to go in the\r\naffair.", "“Good heavens!” cried de Griers.", "“Seeing that the General takes such an\r\ninterest in the matter, is there anything very unnatural in his\r\ndesiring also to know your plans?”\r\n\r\nAgain I began my explanations, but the Frenchman only fidgeted and\r\nrolled his head about as he listened with an expression of manifest and\r\nunconcealed irony on his face.", "In short, he adopted a supercilious\r\nattitude.", "For my own part, I endeavoured to pretend that I took the\r\naffair very seriously.", "I declared that, since the Baron had gone and\r\ncomplained of me to the General, as though I were a mere servant of the\r\nGeneral’s, he had, in the first place, lost me my post, and, in the\r\nsecond place, treated me like a person to whom, as to one not qualified\r\nto answer for himself, it was not even worth while to speak.", "Naturally,\r\nI said, I felt insulted at this.", "Yet, comprehending as I did,\r\ndifferences of years, of social status, and so forth (here I could\r\nscarcely help smiling), I was not anxious to bring about further scenes\r\nby going personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the Baron.", "All that I felt was that I had a right to go in person and beg the\r\nBaron’s and the Baroness’s pardon—the more so since, of late, I had\r\nbeen feeling unwell and unstrung, and had been in a fanciful condition.", "And so forth, and so forth.", "Yet (I continued) the Baron’s offensive\r\nbehaviour to me of yesterday (that is to say, the fact of his referring\r\nthe matter to the General) as well as his insistence that the General\r\nshould deprive me of my post, had placed me in such a position that I\r\ncould not well express my regret to him (the Baron) and to his good\r\nlady, for the reason that in all probability both he and the Baroness,\r\nwith the world at large, would imagine that I was doing so merely\r\nbecause I hoped, by my action, to recover my post.", "Hence, I found\r\nmyself forced to request the Baron to express to me _his own_ regrets,\r\nas well as to express them in the most unqualified manner—to say, in\r\nfact, that he had never had any wish to insult me.", "After the Baron had\r\ndone _that_, I should, for my part, at once feel free to express to\r\nhim, whole-heartedly and without reserve, my own regrets.", "“In short,” I\r\ndeclared in conclusion, “my one desire is that the Baron may make it\r\npossible for me to adopt the latter course.”\r\n\r\n“Oh fie!", "What refinements and subtleties!” exclaimed De Griers.", "“Besides, what have you to express regret for?", "Confess, Monsieur,\r\nMonsieur—pardon me, but I have forgotten your name—confess, I say, that\r\nall this is merely a plan to annoy the General?", "Or perhaps, you have\r\nsome other and special end in view?", "Eh?”\r\n\r\n“In return you must pardon _me_, mon cher Marquis, and tell me what\r\n_you_ have to do with it.”\r\n\r\n“The General—”\r\n\r\n“But what of the General?", "Last night he said that, for some reason or\r\nanother, it behoved him to ‘move with especial care at present;’\r\nwherefore, he was feeling nervous.", "But I did not understand the\r\nreference.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there _do_ exist special reasons for his doing so,” assented De\r\nGriers in a conciliatory tone, yet with rising anger.", "“You are\r\nacquainted with Mlle.", "de Cominges, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“Mlle.", "Blanche, you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mlle.", "Blanche de Cominges."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_27", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 27)", "language": "de", "content": "Doubtless you know also that the\r\nGeneral is in love with this young lady, and may even be about to marry\r\nher before he leaves here?

Enfin il fera une querelle d’Allemand.”\r\n\r\n“I do not care,” I replied, “seeing that I no longer belong to his\r\nhousehold” (of set purpose I was trying to talk as senselessly as\r\npossible). “But is it quite settled that Mlle. is to marry the General? What are they waiting for? Why should they conceal such a matter—at all\r\nevents from ourselves, the General’s own party?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you. The marriage is not yet a settled affair, for they\r\nare awaiting news from Russia. The General has business transactions to\r\narrange.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Connected, doubtless, with madame his mother?”\r\n\r\nDe Griers shot at me a glance of hatred. “To cut things short,” he interrupted, “I have complete confidence in\r\nyour native politeness, as well as in your tact and good sense. I feel\r\nsure that you will do what I suggest, even if it is only for the sake\r\nof this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and\r\nhas always loved and respected you.”\r\n\r\n“Be so good as to observe,” I remarked, “that the same family has just\r\n_expelled_ me from its bosom. All that you are saying you are saying\r\nbut for show; but, when people have just said to you, ‘Of course we do\r\nnot wish to turn you out, yet, for the sake of appearance’s, you must\r\n_permit_ yourself to be turned out,’ nothing can matter very much.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then,” he said, in a sterner and more arrogant tone. “Seeing that my solicitations have had no effect upon you, it is my\r\nduty to mention that other measures will be taken. There exist here\r\npolice, you must remember, and this very day they shall send you\r\npacking. Que diable! To think of a blanc bec like yourself challenging\r\na person like the Baron to a duel! Do you suppose that you will be\r\n_allowed_ to do such things? Just try doing them, and see if any one\r\nwill be afraid of you! The reason why I have asked you to desist is\r\nthat I can see that your conduct is causing the General annoyance. Do\r\nyou believe that the Baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you\r\nout of doors?”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless I should not GO out of doors,” I retorted with absolute\r\ncalm. “You are labouring under a delusion, Monsieur de Griers. The\r\nthing will be done in far better trim than you imagine. I was just\r\nabout to start for Mr. Astley’s, to ask him to be my intermediary—in\r\nother words, my second. He has a strong liking for me, and I do not\r\nthink that he will refuse. He will go and see the Baron on MY behalf,\r\nand the Baron will certainly not decline to receive him. Although I am\r\nonly a tutor—a kind of subaltern, Mr. Astley is known to all men as the\r\nnephew of a real English lord, the Lord Piebroch, as well as a lord in\r\nhis own right. Yes, you may be pretty sure that the Baron will be civil\r\nto Mr. Astley, and listen to him. Or, should he decline to do so, Mr. Astley will take the refusal as a personal affront to himself (for you\r\nknow how persistent the English are?) and thereupon introduce to the\r\nBaron a friend of his own (and he has many friends in a good position). That being so, picture to yourself the issue of the affair—an affair\r\nwhich will not quite end as you think it will.”\r\n\r\nThis caused the Frenchman to bethink him of playing the coward. “Really\r\nthings may be as this fellow says,” he evidently thought. “Really he\r\n_might_ be able to engineer another scene.”\r\n\r\n“Once more I beg of you to let the matter drop,” he continued in a tone\r\nthat was now entirely conciliatory. “One would think that it actually\r\n_pleased_ you to have scenes!

Read\r\nthem, please, for I must take her back an answer.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took from his pocket a small, compact, wafer-sealed note,\r\nand handed it to me. In Polina’s handwriting I read:\r\n\r\n“I hear that you are thinking of going on with this affair. You have\r\nlost your temper now, and are beginning to play the fool! Certain\r\ncircumstances, however, I may explain to you later. Pray cease from\r\nyour folly, and put a check upon yourself. For folly it all is.

My lips\r\ngrew pale, and I began to tremble. Meanwhile, the cursed Frenchman was\r\neyeing me discreetly and askance, as though he wished to avoid\r\nwitnessing my confusion. It would have been better if he had laughed\r\noutright. “Very well,” I said, “you can tell Mlle. not to disturb herself. But,”\r\nI added sharply, “I would also ask you why you have been so long in\r\nhanding me this note? Instead of chattering about trifles, you ought to\r\nhave delivered me the missive at once—if you have really come\r\ncommissioned as you say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, pardon some natural haste on my part, for the situation is so\r\nstrange. I wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your\r\nintentions; and, moreover, I did not know the contents of the note, and\r\nthought that it could be given you at any time.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” I replied. “So you were ordered to hand me the note\r\nonly in the last resort, and if you could not otherwise appease me? Is\r\nit not so? Speak out, Monsieur de Griers.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said he, assuming a look of great forbearance, but gazing at\r\nme in a meaning way. I reached for my hat; whereupon he nodded, and went out. Yet on his\r\nlips I fancied that I could see a mocking smile. How could it have been\r\notherwise? “You and I are to have a reckoning later, Master Frenchman,” I muttered\r\nas I descended the stairs. “Yes, we will measure our strength\r\ntogether.” Yet my thoughts were all in confusion, for again something\r\nseemed to have struck me dizzy. Presently the air revived me a little,\r\nand, a couple of minutes later, my brain had sufficiently cleared to\r\nenable two ideas in particular to stand out in it. Firstly, I asked\r\nmyself, which of the absurd, boyish, and extravagant threats which I\r\nhad uttered at random last night had made everybody so alarmed? Secondly, what was the influence which this Frenchman appeared to\r\nexercise over Polina? He had but to give the word, and at once she did\r\nas he desired—at once she wrote me a note to beg of me to forbear! Of\r\ncourse, the relations between the pair had, from the first, been a\r\nriddle to me—they had been so ever since I had first made their\r\nacquaintance. But of late I had remarked in her a strong aversion for,\r\neven a contempt for—him, while, for his part, he had scarcely even\r\nlooked at her, but had behaved towards her always in the most churlish\r\nfashion. Yes, I had noted that. Also, Polina herself had mentioned to\r\nme her dislike for him, and delivered herself of some remarkable\r\nconfessions on the subject. Hence, he must have got her into his power\r\nsomehow—somehow he must be holding her as in a vice. VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll at once, on the Promenade, as it was called—that is to say, in the\r\nChestnut Avenue—I came face to face with my Englishman. “I was just coming to see you,” he said; “and you appear to be out on a\r\nsimilar errand.", "sentences": ["I have said that the affair may\r\nprove to be diverting, and even clever, and that possibly you may\r\nattain something by it; yet none the less I tell you” (he said this\r\nonly because he saw me rise and reach for my hat) “that I have come\r\nhither also to hand you these few words from a certain person.", "Read\r\nthem, please, for I must take her back an answer.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took from his pocket a small, compact, wafer-sealed note,\r\nand handed it to me.", "In Polina’s handwriting I read:\r\n\r\n“I hear that you are thinking of going on with this affair.", "You have\r\nlost your temper now, and are beginning to play the fool!", "Certain\r\ncircumstances, however, I may explain to you later.", "Pray cease from\r\nyour folly, and put a check upon yourself.", "For folly it all is.", "I have\r\nneed of you, and, moreover, you have promised to obey me.", "Remember the\r\nShlangenberg.", "I ask you to be obedient.", "If necessary, I shall even\r\n_bid_ you be obedient.—Your own\r\n\r\n     POLINA.", "“_P.S._—If so be that you still bear a grudge against me for what\r\nhappened last night, pray forgive me.”\r\n\r\nEverything, to my eyes, seemed to change as I read these words.", "My lips\r\ngrew pale, and I began to tremble.", "Meanwhile, the cursed Frenchman was\r\neyeing me discreetly and askance, as though he wished to avoid\r\nwitnessing my confusion.", "It would have been better if he had laughed\r\noutright.", "“Very well,” I said, “you can tell Mlle.", "not to disturb herself.", "But,”\r\nI added sharply, “I would also ask you why you have been so long in\r\nhanding me this note?", "Instead of chattering about trifles, you ought to\r\nhave delivered me the missive at once—if you have really come\r\ncommissioned as you say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, pardon some natural haste on my part, for the situation is so\r\nstrange.", "I wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your\r\nintentions; and, moreover, I did not know the contents of the note, and\r\nthought that it could be given you at any time.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” I replied.", "“So you were ordered to hand me the note\r\nonly in the last resort, and if you could not otherwise appease me?", "Is\r\nit not so?", "Speak out, Monsieur de Griers.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said he, assuming a look of great forbearance, but gazing at\r\nme in a meaning way.", "I reached for my hat; whereupon he nodded, and went out.", "Yet on his\r\nlips I fancied that I could see a mocking smile.", "How could it have been\r\notherwise?", "“You and I are to have a reckoning later, Master Frenchman,” I muttered\r\nas I descended the stairs.", "“Yes, we will measure our strength\r\ntogether.” Yet my thoughts were all in confusion, for again something\r\nseemed to have struck me dizzy.", "Presently the air revived me a little,\r\nand, a couple of minutes later, my brain had sufficiently cleared to\r\nenable two ideas in particular to stand out in it.", "Firstly, I asked\r\nmyself, which of the absurd, boyish, and extravagant threats which I\r\nhad uttered at random last night had made everybody so alarmed?", "Secondly, what was the influence which this Frenchman appeared to\r\nexercise over Polina?", "He had but to give the word, and at once she did\r\nas he desired—at once she wrote me a note to beg of me to forbear!", "Of\r\ncourse, the relations between the pair had, from the first, been a\r\nriddle to me—they had been so ever since I had first made their\r\nacquaintance.", "But of late I had remarked in her a strong aversion for,\r\neven a contempt for—him, while, for his part, he had scarcely even\r\nlooked at her, but had behaved towards her always in the most churlish\r\nfashion.", "Yes, I had noted that.", "Also, Polina herself had mentioned to\r\nme her dislike for him, and delivered herself of some remarkable\r\nconfessions on the subject.", "Hence, he must have got her into his power\r\nsomehow—somehow he must be holding her as in a vice.", "VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll at once, on the Promenade, as it was called—that is to say, in the\r\nChestnut Avenue—I came face to face with my Englishman.", "“I was just coming to see you,” he said; “and you appear to be out on a\r\nsimilar errand."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_29", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 29)", "language": "de", "content": "So you have parted with your employers?”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that?” I asked in astonishment. “Is _every one_ aware\r\nof the fact?”\r\n\r\n“By no means. Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment. Indeed, I have never heard any one speak of it.”\r\n\r\n“Then how come you to know it?”\r\n\r\n“Because I have had occasion to do so. Whither are you bound? I like\r\nyou, and was therefore coming to pay you a visit.”\r\n\r\n“What a splendid fellow you are, Mr. Astley!” I cried, though still\r\nwondering how he had come by his knowledge. “And since I have not yet\r\nhad my coffee, and you have, in all probability, scarcely tasted yours,\r\nlet us adjourn to the Casino Café, where we can sit and smoke and have\r\na talk.”\r\n\r\nThe café in question was only a hundred paces away; so, when coffee had\r\nbeen brought, we seated ourselves, and I lit a cigarette. Astley was no\r\nsmoker, but, taking a seat by my side, he prepared himself to listen. “I do not intend to go away,” was my first remark. “I intend, on the\r\ncontrary, to remain here.”\r\n\r\n“That I never doubted,” he answered good-humouredly. It is a curious fact that, on my way to see him, I had never even\r\nthought of telling him of my love for Polina. In fact, I had purposely\r\nmeant to avoid any mention of the subject. Nor, during our stay in the\r\nplace, had I ever made aught but the scantiest reference to it. You\r\nsee, not only was Astley a man of great reserve, but also from the\r\nfirst I had perceived that Polina had made a great impression upon him,\r\nalthough he never spoke of her. But now, strangely enough, he had no\r\nsooner seated himself and bent his steely gaze upon me, than, for some\r\nreason or another, I felt moved to tell him everything—to speak to him\r\nof my love in all its phases. For an hour and a half did I discourse on\r\nthe subject, and found it a pleasure to do so, even though this was the\r\nfirst occasion on which I had referred to the matter. Indeed, when, at\r\ncertain moments, I perceived that my more ardent passages confused him,\r\nI purposely increased my ardour of narration. Yet one thing I regret:\r\nand that is that I made references to the Frenchman which were a little\r\nover-personal. Mr. Astley sat without moving as he listened to me. Not a word nor a\r\nsound of any kind did he utter as he stared into my eyes. Suddenly,\r\nhowever, on my mentioning the Frenchman, he interrupted me, and\r\ninquired sternly whether I did right to speak of an extraneous matter\r\n(he had always been a strange man in his mode of propounding\r\nquestions). “No, I fear not,” I replied. “And concerning this Marquis and Mlle. Polina you know nothing beyond\r\nsurmise?”\r\n\r\nAgain I was surprised that such a categorical question should come from\r\nsuch a reserved individual. “No, I know nothing _for certain_ about them” was my reply. “No—nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me, or even to\r\nimagine things about them.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, quite so,” I interrupted in some astonishment. “I admit\r\nthat. Yet that is not the question.” Whereupon I related to him in\r\ndetail the incident of two days ago. I spoke of Polina’s outburst, of\r\nmy encounter with the Baron, of my dismissal, of the General’s\r\nextraordinary pusillanimity, and of the call which De Griers had that\r\nmorning paid me. In conclusion, I showed Astley the note which I had\r\nlately received. “What do you make of it?” I asked. “When I met you I was just coming to\r\nask you your opinion. For myself, I could have killed this Frenchman,\r\nand am not sure that I shall not do so even yet.”\r\n\r\n“I feel the same about it,” said Mr. Astley. “As for Mlle. Polina—well,\r\nyou yourself know that, if necessity drives, one enters into relation\r\nwith people whom one simply detests. Even between this couple there may\r\nbe something which, though unknown to you, depends upon extraneous\r\ncircumstances. For, my own part, I think that you may reassure\r\nyourself—or at all events partially. And as for Mlle.", "sentences": ["So you have parted with your employers?”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that?” I asked in astonishment.", "“Is _every one_ aware\r\nof the fact?”\r\n\r\n“By no means.", "Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment.", "Indeed, I have never heard any one speak of it.”\r\n\r\n“Then how come you to know it?”\r\n\r\n“Because I have had occasion to do so.", "Whither are you bound?", "I like\r\nyou, and was therefore coming to pay you a visit.”\r\n\r\n“What a splendid fellow you are, Mr.", "Astley!” I cried, though still\r\nwondering how he had come by his knowledge.", "“And since I have not yet\r\nhad my coffee, and you have, in all probability, scarcely tasted yours,\r\nlet us adjourn to the Casino Café, where we can sit and smoke and have\r\na talk.”\r\n\r\nThe café in question was only a hundred paces away; so, when coffee had\r\nbeen brought, we seated ourselves, and I lit a cigarette.", "Astley was no\r\nsmoker, but, taking a seat by my side, he prepared himself to listen.", "“I do not intend to go away,” was my first remark.", "“I intend, on the\r\ncontrary, to remain here.”\r\n\r\n“That I never doubted,” he answered good-humouredly.", "It is a curious fact that, on my way to see him, I had never even\r\nthought of telling him of my love for Polina.", "In fact, I had purposely\r\nmeant to avoid any mention of the subject.", "Nor, during our stay in the\r\nplace, had I ever made aught but the scantiest reference to it.", "You\r\nsee, not only was Astley a man of great reserve, but also from the\r\nfirst I had perceived that Polina had made a great impression upon him,\r\nalthough he never spoke of her.", "But now, strangely enough, he had no\r\nsooner seated himself and bent his steely gaze upon me, than, for some\r\nreason or another, I felt moved to tell him everything—to speak to him\r\nof my love in all its phases.", "For an hour and a half did I discourse on\r\nthe subject, and found it a pleasure to do so, even though this was the\r\nfirst occasion on which I had referred to the matter.", "Indeed, when, at\r\ncertain moments, I perceived that my more ardent passages confused him,\r\nI purposely increased my ardour of narration.", "Yet one thing I regret:\r\nand that is that I made references to the Frenchman which were a little\r\nover-personal.", "Mr.", "Astley sat without moving as he listened to me.", "Not a word nor a\r\nsound of any kind did he utter as he stared into my eyes.", "Suddenly,\r\nhowever, on my mentioning the Frenchman, he interrupted me, and\r\ninquired sternly whether I did right to speak of an extraneous matter\r\n(he had always been a strange man in his mode of propounding\r\nquestions).", "“No, I fear not,” I replied.", "“And concerning this Marquis and Mlle.", "Polina you know nothing beyond\r\nsurmise?”\r\n\r\nAgain I was surprised that such a categorical question should come from\r\nsuch a reserved individual.", "“No, I know nothing _for certain_ about them” was my reply.", "“No—nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me, or even to\r\nimagine things about them.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, quite so,” I interrupted in some astonishment.", "“I admit\r\nthat.", "Yet that is not the question.” Whereupon I related to him in\r\ndetail the incident of two days ago.", "I spoke of Polina’s outburst, of\r\nmy encounter with the Baron, of my dismissal, of the General’s\r\nextraordinary pusillanimity, and of the call which De Griers had that\r\nmorning paid me.", "In conclusion, I showed Astley the note which I had\r\nlately received.", "“What do you make of it?” I asked.", "“When I met you I was just coming to\r\nask you your opinion.", "For myself, I could have killed this Frenchman,\r\nand am not sure that I shall not do so even yet.”\r\n\r\n“I feel the same about it,” said Mr.", "Astley.", "“As for Mlle.", "Polina—well,\r\nyou yourself know that, if necessity drives, one enters into relation\r\nwith people whom one simply detests.", "Even between this couple there may\r\nbe something which, though unknown to you, depends upon extraneous\r\ncircumstances.", "For, my own part, I think that you may reassure\r\nyourself—or at all events partially.", "And as for Mlle."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_30", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 30)", "language": "de", "content": "Polina’s\r\nproceedings of two days ago, they were, of course, strange; not because\r\nshe can have meant to get rid of you, or to earn for you a thrashing\r\nfrom the Baron’s cudgel (which for some curious reason, he did not use,\r\nalthough he had it ready in his hands), but because such proceedings on\r\nthe part of such—well, of such a refined lady as Mlle. Polina are, to\r\nsay the least of it, unbecoming. But she cannot have guessed that you\r\nwould carry out her absurd wish to the letter?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what?” suddenly I cried as I fixed Mr. Astley with my\r\ngaze. “I believe that you have already heard the story from some\r\none—very possibly from Mlle. Polina herself?”\r\n\r\nIn return he gave me an astonished stare. “Your eyes look very fiery,” he said with a return of his former calm,\r\n“and in them I can read suspicion. Now, you have no right whatever to\r\nbe suspicious. It is not a right which I can for a moment recognise,\r\nand I absolutely refuse to answer your questions.”\r\n\r\n“Enough! You need say no more,” I cried with a strange emotion at my\r\nheart, yet not altogether understanding what had aroused that emotion\r\nin my breast. Indeed, when, where, and how could Polina have chosen\r\nAstley to be one of her confidants? Of late I had come rather to\r\noverlook him in this connection, even though Polina had always been a\r\nriddle to me—so much so that now, when I had just permitted myself to\r\ntell my friend of my infatuation in all its aspects, I had found myself\r\nstruck, during the very telling, with the fact that in my relations\r\nwith her I could specify nothing that was explicit, nothing that was\r\npositive. On the contrary, my relations had been purely fantastic,\r\nstrange, and unreal; they had been unlike anything else that I could\r\nthink of. “Very well, very well,” I replied with a warmth equal to Astley’s own. “Then I stand confounded, and have no further opinions to offer. But\r\nyou are a good fellow, and I am glad to know what you think about it\r\nall, even though I do not need your advice.”\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, I resumed:\r\n\r\n“For instance, what reason should you assign for the General taking\r\nfright in this way? Why should my stupid clowning have led the world to\r\nelevate it into a serious incident? Even De Griers has found it\r\nnecessary to put in his oar (and he only interferes on the most\r\nimportant occasions), and to visit me, and to address to me the most\r\nearnest supplications. Yes, _he_, De Griers, has actually been playing\r\nthe suppliant to _me!_ And, mark you, although he came to me as early\r\nas nine o’clock, he had ready-prepared in his hand Mlle. Polina’s note. When, I would ask, was that note written? Mlle. Polina must have been\r\naroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it. At all events\r\nthe circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the Frenchman,\r\nsince she actually begs my pardon in the note—actually begs my pardon! Yet what is her personal concern in the matter? Why is she interested\r\nin it at all? Why, too, is the whole party so afraid of this precious\r\nBaron? And what sort of a business do you call it for the General to be\r\ngoing to marry Mlle. Blanche de Cominges? He told me last night that,\r\nbecause of the circumstance, he must ‘move with especial care at\r\npresent.’ What is your opinion of it all? Your look convinces me that\r\nyou know more about it than I do.”\r\n\r\nMr. Astley smiled and nodded. “Yes, I think I _do_ know more about it than you do,” he assented. “The\r\naffair centres around this Mlle. Blanche. Of that I feel certain.”\r\n\r\n“And what of Mlle.

I myself was in the\r\nplace at the time, and in those days Mlle. Blanche was not known as\r\nMlle. de Cominges, nor was her mother, the Widow de Cominges, even in\r\nexistence. In any case no one ever mentioned the latter. De Griers,\r\ntoo, had not materialised, and I am convinced that not only do the\r\nparties stand in no relation to one another, but also they have not\r\nlong enjoyed one another’s acquaintance. Likewise, the _Marquisate_ de\r\nGriers is of recent creation. Of that I have reason to be sure, owing\r\nto a certain circumstance. Even the name De Griers itself may be taken\r\nto be a new invention, seeing that I have a friend who once met the\r\nsaid ‘Marquis’ under a different name altogether.”\r\n\r\n“Yet he possesses a good circle of friends?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly. Mlle. Blanche also may possess that. Yet it is not three\r\nyears since she received from the local police, at the instance of the\r\nBaroness, an invitation to leave the town. And she left it.”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an\r\nItalian—a prince of some sort, a man who bore an historic name\r\n(Barberini or something of the kind). The fellow was simply a mass of\r\nrings and diamonds—real diamonds, too—and the couple used to drive out\r\nin a marvellous carriage. At first Mlle. Blanche played ‘trente et\r\nquarante’ with fair success, but, later, her luck took a marked change\r\nfor the worse. I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost\r\nan enormous sum. But worse was to ensue, for one fine morning her\r\nprince disappeared—horses, carriage, and all. Also, the hotel bill\r\nwhich he left unpaid was enormous. Upon this Mlle. Zelma (the name\r\nwhich she assumed after figuring as Madame Barberini) was in despair. She shrieked and howled all over the hotel, and even tore her clothes\r\nin her frenzy. In the hotel there was staying also a Polish count (you\r\nmust know that ALL travelling Poles are counts!), and the spectacle of\r\nMlle. Zelma tearing her clothes and, catlike, scratching her face with\r\nher beautiful, scented nails produced upon him a strong impression. So\r\nthe pair had a talk together, and, by luncheon time, she was consoled. Indeed, that evening the couple entered the Casino arm-in-arm—Mlle. Zelma laughing loudly, according to her custom, and showing even more\r\nexpansiveness in her manners than she had before shown. For instance,\r\nshe thrust her way into the file of women roulette-players in the exact\r\nfashion of those ladies who, to clear a space for themselves at the\r\ntables, push their fellow-players roughly aside. Doubtless you have\r\nnoticed them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, they are not worth noticing. To the annoyance of the decent\r\npublic they are allowed to remain here—at all events such of them as\r\ndaily change 4000 franc notes at the tables (though, as soon as ever\r\nthese women cease to do so, they receive an invitation to depart). However, Mlle. Zelma continued to change notes of this kind, but her\r\nplay grew more and more unsuccessful, despite the fact that such\r\nladies’ luck is frequently good, for they have a surprising amount of\r\ncash at their disposal. Suddenly, the Count too disappeared, even as\r\nthe Prince had done, and that same evening Mlle. Zelma was forced to\r\nappear in the Casino alone. On this occasion no one offered her a\r\ngreeting. Two days later she had come to the end of her resources;\r\nwhereupon, after staking and losing her last louis d’or she chanced to\r\nlook around her, and saw standing by her side the Baron Burmergelm, who\r\nhad been eyeing her with fixed disapproval. To his distaste, however,\r\nMlle. paid no attention, but, turning to him with her well-known smile,\r\nrequested him to stake, on her behalf, ten louis on the red.

Now, mark you, Mlle. wants to become Madame General, in order that, in future, she may be\r\nspared the receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she\r\nreceived three years ago. At present she is not playing; but that is\r\nonly because, according to the signs, she is lending money to other\r\nplayers. Yes, that is a much more paying game. I even suspect that the\r\nunfortunate General is himself in her debt, as well as, perhaps, also\r\nDe Griers. Or, it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership\r\nwith her. Consequently you yourself will see that, until the marriage\r\nshall have been consummated, Mlle. would scarcely like to have the\r\nattention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself. In short, to\r\nany one in her position, a scandal would be most detrimental. You form\r\na member of the ménage of these people; wherefore, any act of yours\r\nmight cause such a scandal—and the more so since daily she appears in\r\npublic arm in arm with the General or with Mlle.

Only yesterday I saw this Frenchwoman riding, splendidly\r\nmounted, with De Griers, while the General was careering in their wake\r\non a roan horse. He had said, that morning, that his legs were hurting\r\nhim, yet his riding-seat was easy enough. As he passed I looked at him,\r\nand the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever. However, it is no affair of mine, for I have only recently had the\r\nhappiness to make Mlle. Polina’s acquaintance. Also”—he added this as\r\nan afterthought—“I have already told you that I do not recognise your\r\nright to ask me certain questions, however sincere be my liking for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” I said, rising. “To me it is as clear as day that Mlle.

She—she—But who called me by name?” I broke\r\noff. “Who is shouting for me? I heard some one calling in Russian,\r\n‘Alexis Ivanovitch!’ It was a woman’s voice. Listen!”\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we were approaching my hotel. We had left the café long\r\nago, without even noticing that we had done so. “Yes, I _did_ hear a woman’s voice calling, but whose I do not know. The someone was calling you in Russian. Ah! NOW I can see whence the\r\ncries come. They come from that lady there—the one who is sitting on\r\nthe settee, the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a\r\ncrowd of lacqueys. Behind her see that pile of luggage! She must have\r\narrived by train.”\r\n\r\n“But why should she be calling _me?_ Hear her calling again! See! She\r\nis beckoning to us!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, so she is,” assented Mr. Astley. “Alexis Ivanovitch, Alexis Ivanovitch! Good heavens, what a stupid\r\nfellow!” came in a despairing wail from the verandah. We had almost reached the portico, and I was just setting foot upon the\r\nspace before it, when my hands fell to my sides in limp astonishment,\r\nand my feet glued themselves to the pavement! IX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor on the topmost tier of the hotel verandah, after being carried up\r\nthe steps in an armchair amid a bevy of footmen, maid-servants, and\r\nother menials of the hotel, headed by the landlord (that functionary\r\nhad actually run out to meet a visitor who arrived with so much stir\r\nand din, attended by her own retinue, and accompanied by so great a\r\npile of trunks and portmanteaux)—on the topmost tier of the verandah, I\r\nsay, there was sitting—_the grandmother!_ Yes, it was _she_—rich, and\r\nimposing, and seventy-five years of age—Antonida Vassilievna\r\nTarassevitcha, landowner and _grande dame_ of Moscow—the “La\r\nBaboulenka” who had caused so many telegrams to be sent off and\r\nreceived—who had been dying, yet not dying—who had, in her own person,\r\ndescended upon us even as snow might fall from the clouds! Though\r\nunable to walk, she had arrived borne aloft in an armchair (her mode of\r\nconveyance for the last five years), as brisk, aggressive,\r\nself-satisfied, bolt-upright, loudly imperious, and generally abusive\r\nas ever. In fact, she looked exactly as she had on the only two\r\noccasions when I had seen her since my appointment to the General’s\r\nhousehold. Naturally enough, I stood petrified with astonishment. She\r\nhad sighted me a hundred paces off!

Lastly, she was dressed in a black silk gown and white mobcap. “She interests me tremendously,” whispered Mr. Astley as, still\r\nsmoking, he walked by my side. Meanwhile I was reflecting that probably\r\nthe old lady knew all about the telegrams, and even about De Griers,\r\nthough little or nothing about Mlle. Blanche. I said as much to Mr. Astley. But what a frail creature is man! No sooner was my first surprise\r\nabated than I found myself rejoicing in the shock which we were about\r\nto administer to the General. So much did the thought inspire me that I\r\nmarched ahead in the gayest of fashions. Our party was lodging on the third floor. Without knocking at the door,\r\nor in any way announcing our presence, I threw open the portals, and\r\nthe Grandmother was borne through them in triumph. As though of set\r\npurpose, the whole party chanced at that moment to be assembled in the\r\nGeneral’s study. The time was eleven o’clock, and it seemed that an\r\nouting of some sort (at which a portion of the party were to drive in\r\ncarriages, and others to ride on horseback, accompanied by one or two\r\nextraneous acquaintances) was being planned. The General was present,\r\nand also Polina, the children, the latter’s nurses, De Griers, Mlle. Blanche (attired in a riding-habit), her mother, the young Prince, and\r\na learned German whom I beheld for the first time. Into the midst of\r\nthis assembly the lacqueys conveyed Madame in her chair, and set her\r\ndown within three paces of the General! Good heavens! Never shall I forget the spectacle which ensued! Just\r\nbefore our entry, the General had been holding forth to the company,\r\nwith De Griers in support of him. I may also mention that, for the last\r\ntwo or three days, Mlle. Blanche and De Griers had been making a great\r\ndeal of the young Prince, under the very nose of the poor General. In\r\nshort, the company, though decorous and conventional, was in a gay,\r\nfamiliar mood. But no sooner did the Grandmother appear than the\r\nGeneral stopped dead in the middle of a word, and, with jaw dropping,\r\nstared hard at the old lady—his eyes almost starting out of his head,\r\nand his expression as spellbound as though he had just seen a basilisk. In return, the Grandmother stared at him silently and without\r\nmoving—though with a look of mingled challenge, triumph, and ridicule\r\nin her eyes. For ten seconds did the pair remain thus eyeing one\r\nanother, amid the profound silence of the company; and even De Griers\r\nsat petrified—an extraordinary look of uneasiness dawning on his face. As for Mlle. Blanche, she too stared wildly at the Grandmother, with\r\neyebrows raised and her lips parted—while the Prince and the German\r\nsavant contemplated the tableau in profound amazement. Only Polina\r\nlooked anything but perplexed or surprised. Presently, however, she too\r\nturned as white as a sheet, and then reddened to her temples. Truly the\r\nGrandmother’s arrival seemed to be a catastrophe for everybody! For my\r\nown part, I stood looking from the Grandmother to the company, and back\r\nagain, while Mr. Astley, as usual, remained in the background, and\r\ngazed calmly and decorously at the scene. “Well, here I am—and instead of a telegram, too!” the Grandmother at\r\nlast ejaculated, to dissipate the silence. “What? You were not\r\nexpecting me?”\r\n\r\n“Antonida Vassilievna! O my dearest mother! But how on earth did you,\r\ndid you—?” The mutterings of the unhappy General died away. I verily believe that if the Grandmother had held her tongue a few\r\nseconds longer she would have had a stroke. “How on earth did I _what?_” she exclaimed. “Why, I just got into the\r\ntrain and came here. What else is the railway meant for?", "sentences": ["Also, her large grey head,\r\nwith its keen, rugged features, remained always erect as she glanced\r\nabout her in an imperious, challenging sort of way, with looks and\r\ngestures that clearly were unstudied.", "Though she had reached her\r\nseventy-sixth year, her face was still fresh, and her teeth had not\r\ndecayed.", "Lastly, she was dressed in a black silk gown and white mobcap.", "“She interests me tremendously,” whispered Mr.", "Astley as, still\r\nsmoking, he walked by my side.", "Meanwhile I was reflecting that probably\r\nthe old lady knew all about the telegrams, and even about De Griers,\r\nthough little or nothing about Mlle.", "Blanche.", "I said as much to Mr.", "Astley.", "But what a frail creature is man!", "No sooner was my first surprise\r\nabated than I found myself rejoicing in the shock which we were about\r\nto administer to the General.", "So much did the thought inspire me that I\r\nmarched ahead in the gayest of fashions.", "Our party was lodging on the third floor.", "Without knocking at the door,\r\nor in any way announcing our presence, I threw open the portals, and\r\nthe Grandmother was borne through them in triumph.", "As though of set\r\npurpose, the whole party chanced at that moment to be assembled in the\r\nGeneral’s study.", "The time was eleven o’clock, and it seemed that an\r\nouting of some sort (at which a portion of the party were to drive in\r\ncarriages, and others to ride on horseback, accompanied by one or two\r\nextraneous acquaintances) was being planned.", "The General was present,\r\nand also Polina, the children, the latter’s nurses, De Griers, Mlle.", "Blanche (attired in a riding-habit), her mother, the young Prince, and\r\na learned German whom I beheld for the first time.", "Into the midst of\r\nthis assembly the lacqueys conveyed Madame in her chair, and set her\r\ndown within three paces of the General!", "Good heavens!", "Never shall I forget the spectacle which ensued!", "Just\r\nbefore our entry, the General had been holding forth to the company,\r\nwith De Griers in support of him.", "I may also mention that, for the last\r\ntwo or three days, Mlle.", "Blanche and De Griers had been making a great\r\ndeal of the young Prince, under the very nose of the poor General.", "In\r\nshort, the company, though decorous and conventional, was in a gay,\r\nfamiliar mood.", "But no sooner did the Grandmother appear than the\r\nGeneral stopped dead in the middle of a word, and, with jaw dropping,\r\nstared hard at the old lady—his eyes almost starting out of his head,\r\nand his expression as spellbound as though he had just seen a basilisk.", "In return, the Grandmother stared at him silently and without\r\nmoving—though with a look of mingled challenge, triumph, and ridicule\r\nin her eyes.", "For ten seconds did the pair remain thus eyeing one\r\nanother, amid the profound silence of the company; and even De Griers\r\nsat petrified—an extraordinary look of uneasiness dawning on his face.", "As for Mlle.", "Blanche, she too stared wildly at the Grandmother, with\r\neyebrows raised and her lips parted—while the Prince and the German\r\nsavant contemplated the tableau in profound amazement.", "Only Polina\r\nlooked anything but perplexed or surprised.", "Presently, however, she too\r\nturned as white as a sheet, and then reddened to her temples.", "Truly the\r\nGrandmother’s arrival seemed to be a catastrophe for everybody!", "For my\r\nown part, I stood looking from the Grandmother to the company, and back\r\nagain, while Mr.", "Astley, as usual, remained in the background, and\r\ngazed calmly and decorously at the scene.", "“Well, here I am—and instead of a telegram, too!” the Grandmother at\r\nlast ejaculated, to dissipate the silence.", "“What?", "You were not\r\nexpecting me?”\r\n\r\n“Antonida Vassilievna!", "O my dearest mother!", "But how on earth did you,\r\ndid you—?” The mutterings of the unhappy General died away.", "I verily believe that if the Grandmother had held her tongue a few\r\nseconds longer she would have had a stroke.", "“How on earth did I _what?_” she exclaimed.", "“Why, I just got into the\r\ntrain and came here.", "What else is the railway meant for?"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_36", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 36)", "language": "de", "content": "But you\r\nthought that I had turned up my toes and left my property to the lot of\r\nyou. Oh, I know _all_ about the telegrams which you have been\r\ndispatching. They must have cost you a pretty sum, I should think, for\r\ntelegrams are not sent from abroad for nothing. Well, I picked up my\r\nheels, and came here. Who is this Frenchman? Monsieur de Griers, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\n“Oui, madame,” assented De Griers. “Et, croyez, je suis si enchanté! Votre santé—c’est un miracle vous voir ici. Une surprise charmante!”\r\n\r\n“Just so. ‘Charmante!’ I happen to know you as a mountebank, and\r\ntherefore trust you no more than _this_.” She indicated her little\r\nfinger. “And who is _that?_” she went on, turning towards Mlle. Blanche. Evidently the Frenchwoman looked so becoming in her\r\nriding-habit, with her whip in her hand, that she had made an\r\nimpression upon the old lady. “Who is that woman there?”\r\n\r\n“Mlle. de Cominges,” I said. “And this is her mother, Madame de\r\nCominges. They also are staying in the hotel.”\r\n\r\n“Is the daughter married?” asked the old lady, without the least\r\nsemblance of ceremony. “No,” I replied as respectfully as possible, but under my breath. “Is she good company?”\r\n\r\nI failed to understand the question. “I mean, is she or is she not a bore? Can she speak Russian? When this\r\nDe Griers was in Moscow he soon learnt to make himself understood.”\r\n\r\nI explained to the old lady that Mlle. Blanche had never visited\r\nRussia. “Bonjour, then,” said Madame, with sudden brusquerie. “Bonjour, madame,” replied Mlle. Blanche with an elegant, ceremonious\r\nbow as, under cover of an unwonted modesty, she endeavoured to express,\r\nboth in face and figure, her extreme surprise at such strange behaviour\r\non the part of the Grandmother. “How the woman sticks out her eyes at me! How she mows and minces!” was\r\nthe Grandmother’s comment. Then she turned suddenly to the General, and\r\ncontinued: “I have taken up my abode here, so am going to be your\r\nnext-door neighbour. Are you glad to hear that, or are you not?”\r\n\r\n“My dear mother, believe me when I say that I am sincerely delighted,”\r\nreturned the General, who had now, to a certain extent, recovered his\r\nsenses; and inasmuch as, when occasion arose, he could speak with\r\nfluency, gravity, and a certain effect, he set himself to be expansive\r\nin his remarks, and went on: “We have been so dismayed and upset by the\r\nnews of your indisposition! We had received such hopeless telegrams\r\nabout you! Then suddenly—”\r\n\r\n“Fibs, fibs!” interrupted the Grandmother. “How on earth, too, did you come to decide upon the journey?” continued\r\nthe General, with raised voice as he hurried to overlook the old lady’s\r\nlast remark. “Surely, at your age, and in your present state of health,\r\nthe thing is so unexpected that our surprise is at least intelligible. However, I am glad to see you (as indeed, are we all”—he said this with\r\na dignified, yet conciliatory, smile), “and will use my best endeavours\r\nto render your stay here as pleasant as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Enough! All this is empty chatter. You are talking the usual nonsense. I shall know quite well how to spend my time. How did I come to\r\nundertake the journey, you ask? Well, is there anything so very\r\nsurprising about it? It was done quite simply. What is every one going\r\ninto ecstasies about?—How do you do, Prascovia? What are _you_ doing\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“And how are _you_, Grandmother?” replied Polina, as she approached the\r\nold lady. “Were you long on the journey?”\r\n\r\n“The most sensible question that I have yet been asked!

Are you going to whistle all your property away?”\r\n\r\nThis made such an impression upon the General that he almost choked\r\nwith fury. “Roulette, indeed? _I_ play roulette?

How do you do?” she added to\r\nthe gentleman in question. Mr. Astley bowed in silence. “Have you _nothing_ to say to me?” the old lady went on. “Say\r\nsomething, for goodness’ sake! Translate to him, Polina.”\r\n\r\nPolina did so. “I have only to say,” replied Mr. Astley gravely, but also with\r\nalacrity, “that I am indeed glad to see you in such good health.” This\r\nwas interpreted to the Grandmother, and she seemed much gratified. “How well English people know how to answer one!” she remarked. “That\r\nis why I like them so much better than French. Come here,” she added to\r\nMr. Astley. “I will try not to bore you too much. Polina, translate to\r\nhim that I am staying in rooms on a lower floor.

You have some character about\r\nyou. I too have character. Turn round. Surely that is not false hair\r\nthat you are wearing?”\r\n\r\n“No, Grandmamma. It is my own.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well. I do not like the stupid fashions of today. You are very\r\ngood looking. I should have fallen in love with you if I had been a\r\nman. Why do you not get married? It is time now that I was going. I\r\nwant to walk, yet I always have to ride. Are you still in a bad\r\ntemper?” she added to the General. “No, indeed,” rejoined the now mollified General. “I quite understand that at your time of life—”\r\n\r\n“Cette vieille est tombée en enfance,” De Griers whispered to me. “But I want to look round a little,” the old lady added to the General. Will you lend me Alexis Ivanovitch for the purpose? “As much as you like. But I myself—yes, and Polina and Monsieur de\r\nGriers too—we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you.”\r\n\r\n“Mais, madame, cela sera un plaisir,” De Griers commented with a\r\nbewitching smile. “‘Plaisir’ indeed! Why, I look upon you as a perfect fool, monsieur.”\r\nThen she remarked to the General: “I am not going to let you have any\r\nof my money. I must be off to my rooms now, to see what they are like. Afterwards we will look round a little. Lift me up.”\r\n\r\nAgain the Grandmother was borne aloft and carried down the staircase\r\namid a perfect bevy of followers—the General walking as though he had\r\nbeen hit over the head with a cudgel, and De Griers seeming to be\r\nplunged in thought. Endeavouring to be left behind, Mlle. Blanche next\r\nthought better of it, and followed the rest, with the Prince in her\r\nwake. Only the German savant and Madame de Cominges did not leave the\r\nGeneral’s apartments. X\r\n\r\n\r\nAt spas—and, probably, all over Europe—hotel landlords and managers are\r\nguided in their allotment of rooms to visitors, not so much by the\r\nwishes and requirements of those visitors, as by their personal\r\nestimate of the same. It may also be said that these landlords and\r\nmanagers seldom make a mistake. To the Grandmother, however, our\r\nlandlord, for some reason or another, allotted such a sumptuous suite\r\nthat he fairly overreached himself; for he assigned her a suite\r\nconsisting of four magnificently appointed rooms, with bathroom,\r\nservants’ quarters, a separate room for her maid, and so on. In fact,\r\nduring the previous week the suite had been occupied by no less a\r\npersonage than a Grand Duchess: which circumstance was duly explained\r\nto the new occupant, as an excuse for raising the price of these\r\napartments. The Grandmother had herself carried—or, rather,\r\nwheeled—through each room in turn, in order that she might subject the\r\nwhole to a close and attentive scrutiny; while the landlord—an elderly,\r\nbald-headed man—walked respectfully by her side. What every one took the Grandmother to be I do not know, but it\r\nappeared, at least, that she was accounted a person not only of great\r\nimportance, but also, and still more, of great wealth; and without\r\ndelay they entered her in the hotel register as “Madame la générale,\r\nPrincesse de Tarassevitcheva,” although she had never been a princess\r\nin her life. Her retinue, her reserved compartment in the train, her\r\npile of unnecessary trunks, portmanteaux, and strong-boxes, all helped\r\nto increase her prestige; while her wheeled chair, her sharp tone and\r\nvoice, her eccentric questions (put with an air of the most overbearing\r\nand unbridled imperiousness), her whole figure—upright, rugged, and\r\ncommanding as it was—completed the general awe in which she was held. As she inspected her new abode she ordered her chair to be stopped at\r\nintervals in order that, with finger extended towards some article of\r\nfurniture, she might ply the respectfully smiling, yet secretly\r\napprehensive, landlord with unexpected questions.", "sentences": ["Next, the old lady scanned Polina, from head to foot with minute\r\nattention.", "“I could almost have liked you, Prascovia,” suddenly she remarked, “for\r\nyou are a nice girl—the best of the lot.", "You have some character about\r\nyou.", "I too have character.", "Turn round.", "Surely that is not false hair\r\nthat you are wearing?”\r\n\r\n“No, Grandmamma.", "It is my own.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well.", "I do not like the stupid fashions of today.", "You are very\r\ngood looking.", "I should have fallen in love with you if I had been a\r\nman.", "Why do you not get married?", "It is time now that I was going.", "I\r\nwant to walk, yet I always have to ride.", "Are you still in a bad\r\ntemper?” she added to the General.", "“No, indeed,” rejoined the now mollified General.", "“I quite understand that at your time of life—”\r\n\r\n“Cette vieille est tombée en enfance,” De Griers whispered to me.", "“But I want to look round a little,” the old lady added to the General.", "Will you lend me Alexis Ivanovitch for the purpose?", "“As much as you like.", "But I myself—yes, and Polina and Monsieur de\r\nGriers too—we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you.”\r\n\r\n“Mais, madame, cela sera un plaisir,” De Griers commented with a\r\nbewitching smile.", "“‘Plaisir’ indeed!", "Why, I look upon you as a perfect fool, monsieur.”\r\nThen she remarked to the General: “I am not going to let you have any\r\nof my money.", "I must be off to my rooms now, to see what they are like.", "Afterwards we will look round a little.", "Lift me up.”\r\n\r\nAgain the Grandmother was borne aloft and carried down the staircase\r\namid a perfect bevy of followers—the General walking as though he had\r\nbeen hit over the head with a cudgel, and De Griers seeming to be\r\nplunged in thought.", "Endeavouring to be left behind, Mlle.", "Blanche next\r\nthought better of it, and followed the rest, with the Prince in her\r\nwake.", "Only the German savant and Madame de Cominges did not leave the\r\nGeneral’s apartments.", "X\r\n\r\n\r\nAt spas—and, probably, all over Europe—hotel landlords and managers are\r\nguided in their allotment of rooms to visitors, not so much by the\r\nwishes and requirements of those visitors, as by their personal\r\nestimate of the same.", "It may also be said that these landlords and\r\nmanagers seldom make a mistake.", "To the Grandmother, however, our\r\nlandlord, for some reason or another, allotted such a sumptuous suite\r\nthat he fairly overreached himself; for he assigned her a suite\r\nconsisting of four magnificently appointed rooms, with bathroom,\r\nservants’ quarters, a separate room for her maid, and so on.", "In fact,\r\nduring the previous week the suite had been occupied by no less a\r\npersonage than a Grand Duchess: which circumstance was duly explained\r\nto the new occupant, as an excuse for raising the price of these\r\napartments.", "The Grandmother had herself carried—or, rather,\r\nwheeled—through each room in turn, in order that she might subject the\r\nwhole to a close and attentive scrutiny; while the landlord—an elderly,\r\nbald-headed man—walked respectfully by her side.", "What every one took the Grandmother to be I do not know, but it\r\nappeared, at least, that she was accounted a person not only of great\r\nimportance, but also, and still more, of great wealth; and without\r\ndelay they entered her in the hotel register as “Madame la générale,\r\nPrincesse de Tarassevitcheva,” although she had never been a princess\r\nin her life.", "Her retinue, her reserved compartment in the train, her\r\npile of unnecessary trunks, portmanteaux, and strong-boxes, all helped\r\nto increase her prestige; while her wheeled chair, her sharp tone and\r\nvoice, her eccentric questions (put with an air of the most overbearing\r\nand unbridled imperiousness), her whole figure—upright, rugged, and\r\ncommanding as it was—completed the general awe in which she was held.", "As she inspected her new abode she ordered her chair to be stopped at\r\nintervals in order that, with finger extended towards some article of\r\nfurniture, she might ply the respectfully smiling, yet secretly\r\napprehensive, landlord with unexpected questions."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_39", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 39)", "language": "de", "content": "She addressed them to\r\nhim in French, although her pronunciation of the language was so bad\r\nthat sometimes I had to translate them. For the most part, the\r\nlandlord’s answers were unsatisfactory, and failed to please her; nor\r\nwere the questions themselves of a practical nature, but related,\r\ngenerally, to God knows what. For instance, on one occasion she halted before a picture which, a poor\r\ncopy of a well-known original, had a mythological subject. “Of whom is this a portrait?” she inquired. The landlord explained that it was probably that of a countess. “But how know you that?” the old lady retorted. “You live here, yet you cannot say for certain! And why is the picture\r\nthere at all? And why do its eyes look so crooked?”\r\n\r\nTo all these questions the landlord could return no satisfactory reply,\r\ndespite his floundering endeavours. “The blockhead!” exclaimed the Grandmother in Russian. Then she proceeded on her way—only to repeat the same story in front of\r\na Saxon statuette which she had sighted from afar, and had commanded,\r\nfor some reason or another, to be brought to her. Finally, she inquired\r\nof the landlord what was the value of the carpet in her bedroom, as\r\nwell as where the said carpet had been manufactured; but, the landlord\r\ncould do no more than promise to make inquiries. “What donkeys these people are!” she commented. Next, she turned her\r\nattention to the bed. “What a huge counterpane!” she exclaimed. “Turn it back, please.” The\r\nlacqueys did so. “Further yet, further yet,” the old lady cried. “Turn it _right_ back. Also, take off those pillows and bolsters, and lift up the feather\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\nThe bed was opened for her inspection. “Mercifully it contains no bugs,” she remarked. “Pull off the whole thing, and then put on my own pillows and sheets. The place is too luxurious for an old woman like myself. It is too\r\nlarge for any one person. Alexis Ivanovitch, come and see me whenever\r\nyou are not teaching your pupils.”\r\n\r\n“After tomorrow I shall no longer be in the General’s service,” I\r\nreplied, “but merely living in the hotel on my own account.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because, the other day, there arrived from Berlin a German and his\r\nwife—persons of some importance; and, it chanced that, when taking a\r\nwalk, I spoke to them in German without having properly compassed the\r\nBerlin accent.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes: and this action on my part the Baron held to be an insult, and\r\ncomplained about it to the General, who yesterday dismissed me from his\r\nemploy.”\r\n\r\n“But I suppose you must have threatened that precious Baron, or\r\nsomething of the kind? However, even if you did so, it was a matter of\r\nno moment.”\r\n\r\n“No, I did not. The Baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nUpon that the Grandmother turned sharply to the General. “What? You permitted yourself to treat your tutor thus, you nincompoop,\r\nand to dismiss him from his post? You are a blockhead—an utter\r\nblockhead! I can see that clearly.”\r\n\r\n“Do not alarm yourself, my dear mother,” the General replied with a\r\nlofty air—an air in which there was also a tinge of familiarity. “I am\r\nquite capable of managing my own affairs.

Then she\r\nturned to the landlord, and questioned him as to whether _he_ would not\r\nhave fought a duel, if challenged. “For,” she added, “I can see no\r\ndifference between you and the Baron; nor can I bear that German visage\r\nof yours.” Upon this the landlord bowed and departed, though he could\r\nnot have understood the Grandmother’s compliment. “Pardon me, Madame,” the General continued with a sneer, “but are duels\r\nreally feasible?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?

On either side of the wheeled chair walked\r\nPolina and Mlle. Blanche—the latter smiling, modestly jesting, and, in\r\nshort, making herself so agreeable to the Grandmother that in the end\r\nthe old lady relented towards her. On the other side of the chair\r\nPolina had to answer an endless flow of petty questions—such as “Who\r\nwas it passed just now?” “Who is that coming along?” “Is the town a\r\nlarge one?” “Are the public gardens extensive?” “What sort of trees are\r\nthose?” “What is the name of those hills?” “Do I see eagles flying\r\nyonder?” “What is that absurd-looking building?” and so forth. Meanwhile Astley whispered to me, as he walked by my side, that he\r\nlooked for much to happen that morning. Behind the old lady’s chair\r\nmarched Potapitch and Martha—Potapitch in his frockcoat and white\r\nwaistcoat, with a cloak over all, and the forty-year-old and rosy, but\r\nslightly grey-headed, Martha in a mobcap, cotton dress, and squeaking\r\nshoes.

But, alas, the Grandmother had\r\nuttered the fatal words, “I am not going to give you any of my money;”\r\nand though De Griers might regard these words lightly, the General knew\r\nhis mother better. Also, I noticed that De Griers and Mlle. Blanche\r\nwere still exchanging looks; while of the Prince and the German savant\r\nI lost sight at the end of the Avenue, where they had turned back and\r\nleft us.

At once, both in the person of\r\nthe commissionaire and in the persons of the footmen, there sprang to\r\nlife the same reverence as had arisen in the lacqueys of the hotel.

Without loss of time, the Grandmother gave orders that she should be\r\nwheeled through every room in the establishment; of which apartments\r\nshe praised a few, while to others she remained indifferent. Concerning\r\neverything, however, she asked questions. Finally we reached the\r\ngaming-salons, where a lacquey who was, acting as guard over the doors,\r\nflung them open as though he were a man possessed. The Grandmother’s entry into the roulette-salon produced a profound\r\nimpression upon the public. Around the tables, and at the further end\r\nof the room where the trente-et-quarante table was set out, there may\r\nhave been gathered from 150 to 200 gamblers, ranged in several rows. Those who had succeeded in pushing their way to the tables were\r\nstanding with their feet firmly planted, in order to avoid having to\r\ngive up their places until they should have finished their game (since\r\nmerely to stand looking on—thus occupying a gambler’s place for\r\nnothing—was not permitted). True, chairs were provided around the\r\ntables, but few players made use of them—more especially if there was a\r\nlarge attendance of the general public; since to stand allowed of a\r\ncloser approach; and, therefore, of greater facilities for calculation\r\nand staking.

Policemen were stationed\r\nabout the Casino in ordinary costume, and mingled with the spectators\r\nso as to make it impossible to recognise them. In particular they kept\r\na lookout for pickpockets and swindlers, who simply swanned in the\r\nroulette salons, and reaped a rich harvest. Indeed, in every direction\r\nmoney was being filched from pockets or purses—though, of course, if\r\nthe attempt miscarried, a great uproar ensued.

Upon\r\nthis a number of visitors who were not playing, but only looking on\r\n(particularly some Englishmen with their families), pressed closer\r\nforward towards the table, in order to watch the old lady from among\r\nthe ranks of the gamblers. Many a lorgnette I saw turned in her\r\ndirection, and the croupiers’ hopes rose high that such an eccentric\r\nplayer was about to provide them with something out of the common.

Blanche, also remained\r\nhidden among the spectators. At first the old lady did no more than watch the gamblers, and ply me,\r\nin a half-whisper, with sharp-broken questions as to who was so-and-so.

Around him lacqueys fussed—placing chairs just behind where he\r\nwas standing—and clearing the spectators from his vicinity, so that he\r\nshould have more room, and not be crowded—the whole done, of course, in\r\nexpectation of a generous largesse.", "sentences": ["On the other hand, the police of the Casino were an able body of men;\r\nand though to escape the crush was an impossibility, however much one\r\nmight wish it, the eight croupiers apportioned to each table kept an\r\neye upon the stakes, performed the necessary reckoning, and decided\r\ndisputes as they arose.", "In the last resort they always called in the Casino police, and the\r\ndisputes would immediately come to an end.", "Policemen were stationed\r\nabout the Casino in ordinary costume, and mingled with the spectators\r\nso as to make it impossible to recognise them.", "In particular they kept\r\na lookout for pickpockets and swindlers, who simply swanned in the\r\nroulette salons, and reaped a rich harvest.", "Indeed, in every direction\r\nmoney was being filched from pockets or purses—though, of course, if\r\nthe attempt miscarried, a great uproar ensued.", "One had only to approach\r\na roulette table, begin to play, and then openly grab some one else’s\r\nwinnings, for a din to be raised, and the thief to start vociferating\r\nthat the stake was _his;_ and, if the coup had been carried out with\r\nsufficient skill, and the witnesses wavered at all in their testimony,\r\nthe thief would as likely as not succeed in getting away with the\r\nmoney, provided that the sum was not a large one—not large enough to\r\nhave attracted the attention of the croupiers or some fellow-player.", "Moreover, if it were a stake of insignificant size, its true owner\r\nwould sometimes decline to continue the dispute, rather than become\r\ninvolved in a scandal.", "Conversely, if the thief was detected, he was\r\nignominiously expelled the building.", "Upon all this the Grandmother gazed with open-eyed curiosity;

after which they wheeled her chair thither.", "Upon\r\nthis a number of visitors who were not playing, but only looking on\r\n(particularly some Englishmen with their families), pressed closer\r\nforward towards the table, in order to watch the old lady from among\r\nthe ranks of the gamblers.", "Many a lorgnette I saw turned in her\r\ndirection, and the croupiers’ hopes rose high that such an eccentric\r\nplayer was about to provide them with something out of the common.", "An\r\nold lady of seventy-five years who, though unable to walk, desired to\r\nplay was not an everyday phenomenon.", "I too pressed forward towards the\r\ntable, and ranged myself by the Grandmother’s side;

Yet\r\nnever once did the player throw him a glance as he staked and staked,\r\nand raked in his winnings. Evidently, the player in question was dead\r\nto all besides. For a few minutes the Grandmother watched him. “Go and tell him,” suddenly she exclaimed with a nudge at my elbow,\r\n“—go and tell him to stop, and to take his money with him, and go home. Presently he will be losing—yes, losing everything that he has now\r\nwon.” She seemed almost breathless with excitement. “Where is Potapitch?” she continued. “Send Potapitch to speak to him. No, _you_ must tell him, _you_ must tell him,”—here she nudged me\r\nagain—“for I have not the least notion where Potapitch is. Sortez,\r\nsortez,” she shouted to the young man, until I leant over in her\r\ndirection and whispered in her ear that no shouting was allowed, nor\r\neven loud speaking, since to do so disturbed the calculations of the\r\nplayers, and might lead to our being ejected. “How provoking!” she retorted. “Then the young man is done for! I\r\nsuppose he _wishes_ to be ruined. Yet I could not bear to see him have\r\nto return it all. What a fool the fellow is!” and the old lady turned\r\nsharply away. On the left, among the players at the other half of the table, a young\r\nlady was playing, with, beside her, a dwarf. Who the dwarf may have\r\nbeen—whether a relative or a person whom she took with her to act as a\r\nfoil—I do not know; but I had noticed her there on previous occasions,\r\nsince, everyday, she entered the Casino at one o’clock precisely, and\r\ndeparted at two—thus playing for exactly one hour. Being well-known to\r\nthe attendants, she always had a seat provided for her; and, taking\r\nsome gold and a few thousand-franc notes out of her pocket—would begin\r\nquietly, coldly, and after much calculation, to stake, and mark down\r\nthe figures in pencil on a paper, as though striving to work out a\r\nsystem according to which, at given moments, the odds might group\r\nthemselves. Always she staked large coins, and either lost or won one,\r\ntwo, or three thousand francs a day, but not more; after which she\r\nwould depart. The Grandmother took a long look at her. “_That_ woman is not losing,” she said. “To whom does she belong? Do\r\nyou know her? Who is she?”\r\n\r\n“She is, I believe, a Frenchwoman,” I replied. “Ah! A bird of passage, evidently. Besides, I can see that she has her\r\nshoes polished. Now, explain to me the meaning of each round in the\r\ngame, and the way in which one ought to stake.”\r\n\r\nUpon this I set myself to explain the meaning of all the\r\ncombinations—of “rouge et noir,” of “pair et impair,” of “manque et\r\npasse,” with, lastly, the different values in the system of numbers. The Grandmother listened attentively, took notes, put questions in\r\nvarious forms, and laid the whole thing to heart. Indeed, since an\r\nexample of each system of stakes kept constantly occurring, a great\r\ndeal of information could be assimilated with ease and celerity. The\r\nGrandmother was vastly pleased. “But what is zero?” she inquired. “Just now I heard the flaxen-haired\r\ncroupier call out ‘zero!’ And why does he keep raking in all the money\r\nthat is on the table? To think that he should grab the whole pile for\r\nhimself! What does zero mean?”\r\n\r\n“Zero is what the bank takes for itself.

And if so, why do\r\nnot more of these fools stake upon it?”\r\n\r\n“Because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirty-six.”\r\n\r\n“Rubbish! Potapitch, Potapitch! Come here, and I will give you some\r\nmoney.” The old lady took out of her pocket a tightly-clasped purse,\r\nand extracted from its depths a ten-gülden piece. “Go at once, and\r\nstake that upon zero.”\r\n\r\n“But, Madame, zero has only this moment turned up,” I remonstrated;\r\n“wherefore, it may not do so again for ever so long.

Who fears the wolf should never enter the forest. What? We have lost? Then stake again.”\r\n\r\nA second ten-gülden piece did we lose, and then I put down a third. The\r\nGrandmother could scarcely remain seated in her chair, so intent was\r\nshe upon the little ball as it leapt through the notches of the\r\never-revolving wheel. However, the third ten-gülden piece followed the\r\nfirst two. Upon this the Grandmother went perfectly crazy. She could no\r\nlonger sit still, and actually struck the table with her fist when the\r\ncroupier cried out, “Trente-six,” instead of the desiderated zero. “To listen to him!” fumed the old lady. “When will that accursed zero\r\never turn up? I cannot breathe until I see it. I believe that that\r\ninfernal croupier is _purposely_ keeping it from turning up. Alexis\r\nIvanovitch, stake TWO golden pieces this time. The moment we cease to\r\nstake, that cursed zero will come turning up, and we shall get\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“My good Madame—”\r\n\r\n“Stake, stake! It is not _your_ money.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly I staked two ten-gülden pieces. The ball went hopping round\r\nthe wheel until it began to settle through the notches. Meanwhile the\r\nGrandmother sat as though petrified, with my hand convulsively clutched\r\nin hers. “Zero!” called the croupier. “There! You see, you see!” cried the old lady, as she turned and faced\r\nme, wreathed in smiles. “I told you so! It was the Lord God himself who\r\nsuggested to me to stake those two coins. Now, how much ought I to\r\nreceive? Why do they not pay it out to me? Potapitch! Martha! Where are\r\nthey? What has become of our party? Potapitch, Potapitch!”\r\n\r\n“Presently, Madame,” I whispered. “Potapitch is outside, and they would\r\ndecline to admit him to these rooms. See! You are being paid out your\r\nmoney. Pray take it.” The croupiers were making up a heavy packet of\r\ncoins, sealed in blue paper, and containing fifty ten gülden pieces,\r\ntogether with an unsealed packet containing another twenty. I handed\r\nthe whole to the old lady in a money-shovel. “Faites le jeu, messieurs! Faites le jeu, messieurs! Rien ne va plus,”\r\nproclaimed the croupier as once more he invited the company to stake,\r\nand prepared to turn the wheel. “We shall be too late! He is going to spin again! Stake, stake!” The\r\nGrandmother was in a perfect fever. “Do not hang back! Be quick!” She\r\nseemed almost beside herself, and nudged me as hard as she could. “Upon what shall I stake, Madame?”\r\n\r\n“Upon zero, upon zero! Again upon zero! Stake as much as ever you can. How much have we got? Seventy ten-gülden pieces? We shall not miss\r\nthem, so stake twenty pieces at a time.”\r\n\r\n“Think a moment, Madame. Sometimes zero does not turn up for two\r\nhundred rounds in succession. I assure you that you may lose all your\r\ncapital.”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong—utterly wrong. Stake, I tell you! What a chattering\r\ntongue you have!

Surely you are wrong? Monsieur, monsieur—” here\r\nshe nudged the croupier who was sitting on her left, and preparing to\r\nspin—“combien zero? Douze? Douze?”\r\n\r\nI hastened to translate. “Oui, Madame,” was the croupier’s polite reply. “No single stake must\r\nexceed four thousand florins. That is the regulation.”\r\n\r\n“Then there is nothing else for it. We must risk in gülden.”\r\n\r\n“Le jeu est fait!” the croupier called. The wheel revolved, and stopped\r\nat thirty. We had lost! “Again, again, again! Stake again!” shouted the old lady. Without\r\nattempting to oppose her further, but merely shrugging my shoulders, I\r\nplaced twelve more ten-gülden pieces upon the table. The wheel whirled\r\naround and around, with the Grandmother simply quaking as she watched\r\nits revolutions. “Does she again think that zero is going to be the winning coup?”\r\nthought I, as I stared at her in astonishment. Yet an absolute\r\nassurance of winning was shining on her face; she looked perfectly\r\nconvinced that zero was about to be called again. At length the ball\r\ndropped off into one of the notches. “Zero!” cried the croupier. “Ah!!!” screamed the old lady as she turned to me in a whirl of\r\ntriumph. I myself was at heart a gambler. At that moment I became acutely\r\nconscious both of that fact and of the fact that my hands and knees\r\nwere shaking, and that the blood was beating in my brain. Of course\r\nthis was a rare occasion—an occasion on which zero had turned up no\r\nless than three times within a dozen rounds; yet in such an event there\r\nwas nothing so very surprising, seeing that, only three days ago, I\r\nmyself had been a witness to zero turning up _three times in\r\nsuccession_, so that one of the players who was recording the coups on\r\npaper was moved to remark that for several days past zero had never\r\nturned up at all! With the Grandmother, as with any one who has won a very large sum, the\r\nmanagement settled up with great attention and respect, since she was\r\nfortunate to have to receive no less than 4200 gülden. Of these gülden\r\nthe odd 200 were paid her in gold, and the remainder in bank notes. This time the old lady did not call for Potapitch; for that she was too\r\npreoccupied. Though not outwardly shaken by the event (indeed, she\r\nseemed perfectly calm), she was trembling inwardly from head to foot. At length, completely absorbed in the game, she burst out:\r\n\r\n“Alexis Ivanovitch, did not the croupier just say that 4000 florins\r\nwere the most that could be staked at any one time? Well, take these\r\n4000, and stake them upon the red.”\r\n\r\nTo oppose her was useless. Once more the wheel revolved. “Rouge!” proclaimed the croupier. Again 4000 florins—in all 8000! “Give me them,” commanded the Grandmother, “and stake the other 4000\r\nupon the red again.”\r\n\r\nI did so. “Rouge!” proclaimed the croupier. “Twelve thousand!” cried the old lady. “Hand me the whole lot. Put the\r\ngold into this purse here, and count the bank notes. Enough! Let us go\r\nhome. Wheel my chair away.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chair, with the old lady beaming in it, was wheeled away towards\r\nthe doors at the further end of the salon, while our party hastened to\r\ncrowd around her, and to offer her their congratulations.

But in the\r\nmeanwhile, good-bye. Do not forget to call a doctor, for I must take\r\nthe waters. Now go and get rested a little.”\r\n\r\nI left the Grandmother’s presence in a state of bewilderment. Vainly I endeavoured to imagine what would become of our party, or what\r\nturn the affair would next take. I could perceive that none of the\r\nparty had yet recovered their presence of mind—least of all the\r\nGeneral. The factor of the Grandmother’s appearance in place of the\r\nhourly expected telegram to announce her death (with, of course,\r\nresultant legacies) had so upset the whole scheme of intentions and\r\nprojects that it was with a decided feeling of apprehension and growing\r\nparalysis that the conspirators viewed any future performances of the\r\nold lady at roulette. Yet this second factor was not quite so important\r\nas the first, since, though the Grandmother had twice declared that she\r\ndid not intend to give the General any money, that declaration was not\r\na complete ground for the abandonment of hope. Certainly De Griers,\r\nwho, with the General, was up to the neck in the affair, had not wholly\r\nlost courage; and I felt sure that Mlle. Blanche also—Mlle. Blanche who\r\nwas not only as deeply involved as the other two, but also expectant of\r\nbecoming Madame General and an important legatee—would not lightly\r\nsurrender the position, but would use her every resource of coquetry\r\nupon the old lady, in order to afford a contrast to the impetuous\r\nPolina, who was difficult to understand, and lacked the art of\r\npleasing.

Yes, danger loomed ahead. All these thoughts passed through my mind during the few moments that,\r\nhaving left the old lady’s rooms, I was ascending to my own room on the\r\ntop storey. What most struck me was the fact that, though I had divined\r\nthe chief, the stoutest, threads which united the various actors in the\r\ndrama, I had, until now, been ignorant of the methods and secrets of\r\nthe game. For Polina had never been completely open with me. Although,\r\non occasions, it had happened that involuntarily, as it were, she had\r\nrevealed to me something of her heart, I had noticed that in most\r\ncases—in fact, nearly always—she had either laughed away these\r\nrevelations, or grown confused, or purposely imparted to them a false\r\nguise. Yes, she must have concealed a great deal from me. But, I had a\r\npresentiment that now the end of this strained and mysterious situation\r\nwas approaching. Another stroke, and all would be finished and exposed. Of my own fortunes, interested though I was in the affair, I took no\r\naccount. I was in the strange position of possessing but two hundred\r\ngülden, of being at a loose end, of lacking both a post, the means of\r\nsubsistence, a shred of hope, and any plans for the future, yet of\r\ncaring nothing for these things. Had not my mind been so full of\r\nPolina, I should have given myself up to the comical piquancy of the\r\nimpending denouement, and laughed my fill at it. But the thought of\r\nPolina was torture to me. That her fate was settled I already had an\r\ninkling; yet _that_ was not the thought which was giving me so much\r\nuneasiness. What I really wished for was to penetrate her secrets. I\r\nwanted her to come to me and say, “I love you,” and, if she would not\r\nso come, or if to hope that she would ever do so was an unthinkable\r\nabsurdity—why, then there was nothing else for me to want. Even now I\r\ndo not know what I am wanting. I feel like a man who has lost his way. I yearn but to be in her presence, and within the circle of her light\r\nand splendour—to be there now, and forever, and for the whole of my\r\nlife. More I do not know. How can I ever bring myself to leave her? On reaching the third storey of the hotel I experienced a shock. I was\r\njust passing the General’s suite when something caused me to look\r\nround. Out of a door about twenty paces away there was coming Polina! She hesitated for a moment on seeing me, and then beckoned me to her. “Polina Alexandrovna!”\r\n\r\n“Hush! Not so loud.”\r\n\r\n“Something startled me just now,” I whispered, “and I looked round, and\r\nsaw you. Some electrical influence seems to emanate from your form.”\r\n\r\n“Take this letter,” she went on with a frown (probably she had not even\r\nheard my words, she was so preoccupied), “and hand it personally to Mr. Astley.

Without\r\ndoubt the roulette had turned her head, for she appeared to be\r\nindifferent to everything else, and, in general, seemed much\r\ndistraught. For instance, she asked me no questions about objects _en\r\nroute_, except that, when a sumptuous barouche passed us and raised a\r\ncloud of dust, she lifted her hand for a moment, and inquired, “What\r\nwas that?” Yet even then she did not appear to hear my reply, although\r\nat times her abstraction was interrupted by sallies and fits of sharp,\r\nimpatient fidgeting. Again, when I pointed out to her the Baron and\r\nBaroness Burmergelm walking to the Casino, she merely looked at them in\r\nan absent-minded sort of way, and said with complete indifference,\r\n“Ah!” Then, turning sharply to Potapitch and Martha, who were walking\r\nbehind us, she rapped out:\r\n\r\n“Why have _you_ attached yourselves to the party? We are not going to\r\ntake you with us every time. Go home at once.” Then, when the servants\r\nhad pulled hasty bows and departed, she added to me: “You are all the\r\nescort I need.”\r\n\r\nAt the Casino the Grandmother seemed to be expected, for no time was\r\nlost in procuring her former place beside the croupier.", "sentences": ["“Alexis Ivanovitch, I beg of you to save\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, General, how am I to do so?", "On what footing do I stand here?”\r\n\r\n“Refuse to take her about.", "Simply leave her alone.”\r\n\r\n“But she would soon find some one else to take my place?”\r\n\r\n“Ce n’est pas ça, ce n’est pas ça,” again interrupted De Griers.", "“Que\r\ndiable!", "Do not leave her alone so much as advise her, persuade her,\r\ndraw her away.", "In any case do not let her gamble;

as also, that for such services, these officials are awarded\r\nprizes and premiums. At all events, the croupiers of Roulettenberg\r\nseemed to look upon the Grandmother as their lawful prey—whereafter\r\nthere befell what our party had foretold. It happened thus:\r\n\r\nAs soon as ever we arrived the Grandmother ordered me to stake twelve\r\nten-gülden pieces in succession upon zero. Once, twice, and thrice I\r\ndid so, yet zero never turned up. “Stake again,” said the old lady with an impatient nudge of my elbow,\r\nand I obeyed. “How many times have we lost?” she inquired—actually grinding her teeth\r\nin her excitement. “We have lost 144 ten-gülden pieces,” I replied. “I tell you, Madame,\r\nthat zero may not turn up until nightfall.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” she interrupted. “Keep on staking upon zero, and also\r\nstake a thousand gülden upon rouge. Here is a banknote with which to do\r\nso.”\r\n\r\nThe red turned up, but zero missed again, and we only got our thousand\r\ngülden back. “But you see, you see,” whispered the old lady. “We have now recovered\r\nalmost all that we staked. Try zero again. Let us do so another ten\r\ntimes, and then leave off.”\r\n\r\nBy the fifth round, however, the Grandmother was weary of the scheme. “To the devil with that zero!” she exclaimed. “Stake four thousand\r\ngülden upon the red.”\r\n\r\n“But, Madame, that will be so much to venture!” I remonstrated. “Suppose the red should not turn up?” The Grandmother almost struck me\r\nin her excitement. Her agitation was rapidly making her quarrelsome. Consequently, there was nothing for it but to stake the whole four\r\nthousand gülden as she had directed. The wheel revolved while the Grandmother sat as bolt upright, and with\r\nas proud and quiet a mien, as though she had not the least doubt of\r\nwinning. “Zero!” cried the croupier. At first the old lady failed to understand the situation; but, as soon\r\nas she saw the croupier raking in her four thousand gülden, together\r\nwith everything else that happened to be lying on the table, and\r\nrecognised that the zero which had been so long turning up, and on\r\nwhich we had lost nearly two hundred ten-gülden pieces, had at length,\r\nas though of set purpose, made a sudden reappearance—why, the poor old\r\nlady fell to cursing it, and to throwing herself about, and wailing and\r\ngesticulating at the company at large. Indeed, some people in our\r\nvicinity actually burst out laughing. “To think that that accursed zero should have turned up _now!_” she\r\nsobbed. “The accursed, accursed thing! And, it is all _your_ fault,”\r\nshe added, rounding upon me in a frenzy. “It was _you_ who persuaded me\r\nto cease staking upon it.”\r\n\r\n“But, Madame, I only explained the game to you. How am _I_ to answer\r\nfor every mischance which may occur in it?”\r\n\r\n“You and your mischances!” she whispered threateningly. “Go! Away at\r\nonce!”\r\n\r\n“Farewell, then, Madame.” And I turned to depart. “No—stay,” she put in hastily. “Where are you going to? Why should you\r\nleave me? You fool! No, no... stay here. It is _I_ who was the fool. Tell me what I ought to do.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot take it upon myself to advise you, for you will only blame me\r\nif I do so. Play at your own discretion.

I can’t talk to you here.”\r\n\r\nI dropped behind a little, and immediately was pounced upon by De\r\nGriers. “She has lost this morning’s winnings,” I whispered, “and also twelve\r\nthousand gülden of her original money. At the present moment we are\r\ngoing to get some bonds changed.”\r\n\r\nDe Griers stamped his foot with vexation, and hastened to communicate\r\nthe tidings to the General. Meanwhile we continued to wheel the old\r\nlady along. “Stop her, stop her,” whispered the General in consternation. “You had better try and stop her yourself,” I returned—also in a\r\nwhisper. “My good mother,” he said as he approached her, “—my good mother, pray\r\nlet, let—” (his voice was beginning to tremble and sink) “—let us hire\r\na carriage, and go for a drive. Near here there is an enchanting view\r\nto be obtained.

What are you stopping for? I have nothing to say to you.”\r\n\r\n“Here we are, Madame,” I announced. “Here is the moneychanger’s\r\noffice.”\r\n\r\nI entered to get the securities changed, while the Grandmother remained\r\noutside in the porch, and the rest waited at a little distance, in\r\ndoubt as to their best course of action. At length the old lady turned\r\nsuch an angry stare upon them that they departed along the road towards\r\nthe Casino. The process of changing involved complicated calculations which soon\r\nnecessitated my return to the Grandmother for instructions. “The thieves!” she exclaimed as she clapped her hands together. “Never\r\nmind, though.

after which the\r\nGrandmother began to upbraid him at length, and with great vehemence,\r\nfor his alleged usuriousness, and to bargain with him in a mixture of\r\nRussian, French, and German—I acting as interpreter. Meanwhile, the\r\ngrave-faced official eyed us both, and silently nodded his head. At the\r\nGrandmother, in particular, he gazed with a curiosity which almost\r\nbordered upon rudeness. At length, too, he smiled. “Pray recollect yourself!” cried the old lady. “And may my money choke\r\nyou! Alexis Ivanovitch, tell him that we can easily repair to someone\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“The clerk says that others will give you even less than he.”\r\n\r\nOf what the ultimate calculations consisted I do not exactly remember,\r\nbut at all events they were alarming. Receiving twelve thousand florins\r\nin gold, I took also the statement of accounts, and carried it out to\r\nthe Grandmother. “Well, well,” she said, “I am no accountant. Let us hurry away, hurry\r\naway.” And she waved the paper aside. “Neither upon that accursed zero, however, nor upon that equally\r\naccursed red do I mean to stake a cent,” I muttered to myself as I\r\nentered the Casino. This time I did all I could to persuade the old lady to stake as little\r\nas possible—saying that a turn would come in the chances when she would\r\nbe at liberty to stake more. But she was so impatient that, though at\r\nfirst she agreed to do as I suggested, nothing could stop her when once\r\nshe had begun. By way of prelude she won stakes of a hundred and two\r\nhundred gülden. “There you are!” she said as she nudged me. “See what we have won! Surely it would be worth our while to stake four thousand instead of a\r\nhundred, for we might win another four thousand, and then—! Oh, it was\r\nYOUR fault before—all your fault!”\r\n\r\nI felt greatly put out as I watched her play, but I decided to hold my\r\ntongue, and to give her no more advice. Suddenly De Griers appeared on the scene. It seemed that all this while\r\nhe and his companions had been standing beside us—though I noticed that\r\nMlle. Blanche had withdrawn a little from the rest, and was engaged in\r\nflirting with the Prince. Clearly the General was greatly put out at\r\nthis. Indeed, he was in a perfect agony of vexation. But Mlle. was\r\ncareful never to look his way, though he did his best to attract her\r\nnotice. Poor General! By turns his face blanched and reddened, and he\r\nwas trembling to such an extent that he could scarcely follow the old\r\nlady’s play. At length Mlle. and the Prince took their departure, and\r\nthe General followed them. “Madame, Madame,” sounded the honeyed accents of De Griers as he leant\r\nover to whisper in the Grandmother’s ear. “That stake will never win. No, no, it is impossible,” he added in Russian with a writhe. “No, no!”\r\n\r\n“But why not?” asked the Grandmother, turning round. “Show me what I\r\nought to do.”\r\n\r\nInstantly De Griers burst into a babble of French as he advised, jumped\r\nabout, declared that such and such chances ought to be waited for, and\r\nstarted to make calculations of figures. All this he addressed to me in\r\nmy capacity as translator—tapping the table the while with his finger,\r\nand pointing hither and thither. At length he seized a pencil, and\r\nbegan to reckon sums on paper until he had exhausted the Grandmother’s\r\npatience. “Away with you!” she interrupted. “You talk sheer nonsense, for, though\r\nyou keep on saying ‘Madame, Madame,’ you haven’t the least notion what\r\nought to be done. Away with you, I say!”\r\n\r\n“Mais, Madame,” cooed De Griers—and straightway started afresh with his\r\nfussy instructions. “Stake just _once_, as he advises,” the Grandmother said to me, “and\r\nthen we shall see what we _shall_ see.", "sentences": ["The thieves!”\r\n\r\nThe clerk consented to come out when he perceived that he was being\r\nasked for by an old lady who was too infirm to walk; after which the\r\nGrandmother began to upbraid him at length, and with great vehemence,\r\nfor his alleged usuriousness, and to bargain with him in a mixture of\r\nRussian, French, and German—I acting as interpreter.", "Meanwhile, the\r\ngrave-faced official eyed us both, and silently nodded his head.", "At the\r\nGrandmother, in particular, he gazed with a curiosity which almost\r\nbordered upon rudeness.", "At length, too, he smiled.", "“Pray recollect yourself!” cried the old lady.", "“And may my money choke\r\nyou!", "Alexis Ivanovitch, tell him that we can easily repair to someone\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“The clerk says that others will give you even less than he.”\r\n\r\nOf what the ultimate calculations consisted I do not exactly remember,\r\nbut at all events they were alarming.", "Receiving twelve thousand florins\r\nin gold, I took also the statement of accounts, and carried it out to\r\nthe Grandmother.", "“Well, well,” she said, “I am no accountant.", "Let us hurry away, hurry\r\naway.” And she waved the paper aside.", "“Neither upon that accursed zero, however, nor upon that equally\r\naccursed red do I mean to stake a cent,” I muttered to myself as I\r\nentered the Casino.", "This time I did all I could to persuade the old lady to stake as little\r\nas possible—saying that a turn would come in the chances when she would\r\nbe at liberty to stake more.", "But she was so impatient that, though at\r\nfirst she agreed to do as I suggested, nothing could stop her when once\r\nshe had begun.", "By way of prelude she won stakes of a hundred and two\r\nhundred gülden.", "“There you are!” she said as she nudged me.", "“See what we have won!", "Surely it would be worth our while to stake four thousand instead of a\r\nhundred, for we might win another four thousand, and then—!", "Oh, it was\r\nYOUR fault before—all your fault!”\r\n\r\nI felt greatly put out as I watched her play, but I decided to hold my\r\ntongue, and to give her no more advice.", "Suddenly De Griers appeared on the scene.", "It seemed that all this while\r\nhe and his companions had been standing beside us—though I noticed that\r\nMlle.", "Blanche had withdrawn a little from the rest, and was engaged in\r\nflirting with the Prince.", "Clearly the General was greatly put out at\r\nthis.", "Indeed, he was in a perfect agony of vexation.", "But Mlle.", "was\r\ncareful never to look his way, though he did his best to attract her\r\nnotice.", "Poor General!", "By turns his face blanched and reddened, and he\r\nwas trembling to such an extent that he could scarcely follow the old\r\nlady’s play.", "At length Mlle.", "and the Prince took their departure, and\r\nthe General followed them.", "“Madame, Madame,” sounded the honeyed accents of De Griers as he leant\r\nover to whisper in the Grandmother’s ear.", "“That stake will never win.", "No, no, it is impossible,” he added in Russian with a writhe.", "“No, no!”\r\n\r\n“But why not?” asked the Grandmother, turning round.", "“Show me what I\r\nought to do.”\r\n\r\nInstantly De Griers burst into a babble of French as he advised, jumped\r\nabout, declared that such and such chances ought to be waited for, and\r\nstarted to make calculations of figures.", "All this he addressed to me in\r\nmy capacity as translator—tapping the table the while with his finger,\r\nand pointing hither and thither.", "At length he seized a pencil, and\r\nbegan to reckon sums on paper until he had exhausted the Grandmother’s\r\npatience.", "“Away with you!” she interrupted.", "“You talk sheer nonsense, for, though\r\nyou keep on saying ‘Madame, Madame,’ you haven’t the least notion what\r\nought to be done.", "Away with you, I say!”\r\n\r\n“Mais, Madame,” cooed De Griers—and straightway started afresh with his\r\nfussy instructions.", "“Stake just _once_, as he advises,” the Grandmother said to me, “and\r\nthen we shall see what we _shall_ see."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_54", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 54)", "language": "de", "content": "Of course, his stake _might_\r\nwin.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, De Grier’s one object was to distract the old lady\r\nfrom staking large sums; wherefore, he now suggested to her that she\r\nshould stake upon certain numbers, singly and in groups. Consequently,\r\nin accordance with his instructions, I staked a ten-gülden piece upon\r\nseveral odd numbers in the first twenty, and five ten-gülden pieces\r\nupon certain groups of numbers-groups of from twelve to eighteen, and\r\nfrom eighteen to twenty-four. The total staked amounted to 160 gülden. The wheel revolved. “Zero!” cried the croupier. We had lost it all! “The fool!” cried the old lady as she turned upon De Griers. “You\r\ninfernal Frenchman, to think that _you_ should advise! Away with you! Though you fuss and fuss, you don’t even know what you’re talking\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\nDeeply offended, De Griers shrugged his shoulders, favoured the\r\nGrandmother with a look of contempt, and departed. For some time past\r\nhe had been feeling ashamed of being seen in such company, and this had\r\nproved the last straw. An hour later we had lost everything in hand. “Home!” cried the Grandmother. Not until we had turned into the Avenue did she utter a word; but from\r\nthat point onwards, until we arrived at the hotel, she kept venting\r\nexclamations of “What a fool I am! What a silly old fool I am, to be\r\nsure!”\r\n\r\nArrived at the hotel, she called for tea, and then gave orders for her\r\nluggage to be packed. “We are off again,” she announced. “But whither, Madame?” inquired Martha. “What business is that of _yours?_ Let the cricket stick to its\r\nhearth.[2] Potapitch, have everything packed, for we are returning to\r\nMoscow at once. I have fooled away fifteen thousand roubles.”\r\n\r\n [2] The Russian form of “Mind your own business.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen thousand roubles, good mistress? My God!” And Potapitch spat\r\nupon his hands—probably to show that he was ready to serve her in any\r\nway he could. “Now then, you fool! At once you begin with your weeping and wailing! Be quiet, and pack. Also, run downstairs, and get my hotel bill.”\r\n\r\n“The next train leaves at 9:30, Madame,” I interposed, with a view to\r\nchecking her agitation. “And what is the time now?”\r\n\r\n“Half-past eight.”\r\n\r\n“How vexing! But, never mind. Alexis Ivanovitch, I have not a kopeck\r\nleft; I have but these two bank notes. Please run to the office and get\r\nthem changed. Otherwise I shall have nothing to travel with.”\r\n\r\nDeparting on her errand, I returned half an hour later to find the\r\nwhole party gathered in her rooms. It appeared that the news of her\r\nimpending departure for Moscow had thrown the conspirators into\r\nconsternation even greater than her losses had done. For, said they,\r\neven if her departure should save her fortune, what will become of the\r\nGeneral later? And who is to repay De Griers? Clearly Mlle. Blanche\r\nwould never consent to wait until the Grandmother was dead, but would\r\nat once elope with the Prince or someone else. So they had all gathered\r\ntogether—endeavouring to calm and dissuade the Grandmother. Only Polina\r\nwas absent. For her part the Grandmother had nothing for the party but\r\nabuse. “Away with you, you rascals!” she was shouting. “What have my affairs\r\nto do with you? Why, in particular, do _you_”—here she indicated De\r\nGriers—“come sneaking here with your goat’s beard? And what do\r\n_you_”—here she turned to Mlle. Blanche “want of me? What are _you_\r\nfinicking for?”\r\n\r\n“Diantre!” muttered Mlle. under her breath, but her eyes were flashing.

Now,\r\nPotapitch, get things ready.”\r\n\r\nI ascended to my room, and lay down upon the bed. A whole hour I must\r\nhave lain thus, with my head resting upon my hand. So the crisis had\r\ncome! I needed time for its consideration. To-morrow I would have a\r\ntalk with Polina. Ah! The Frenchman! So, it was true? But how could it\r\nbe so? Polina and De Griers! What a combination! No, it was too improbable. Suddenly I leapt up with the idea of seeking\r\nAstley and forcing him to speak. There could be no doubt that he knew\r\nmore than I did. Astley? Well, he was another problem for me to solve. Suddenly there came a knock at the door, and I opened it to find\r\nPotapitch awaiting me. “Sir,” he said, “my mistress is asking for you.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? But she is just departing, is she not? The train leaves in ten\r\nminutes’ time.”\r\n\r\n“She is uneasy, sir; she cannot rest. Come quickly, sir; do not delay.”\r\n\r\nI ran downstairs at once. The Grandmother was just being carried out of\r\nher rooms into the corridor. In her hands she held a roll of\r\nbank-notes. “Alexis Ivanovitch,” she cried, “walk on ahead, and we will set out\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“But whither, Madame?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot rest until I have retrieved my losses. March on ahead, and\r\nask me no questions. Play continues until midnight, does it not?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment I stood stupefied—stood deep in thought; but it was not\r\nlong before I had made up my mind. “With your leave, Madame,” I said, “I will not go with you.”\r\n\r\n“And why not? What do you mean? Is every one here a stupid\r\ngood-for-nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, but I have nothing to reproach myself with. I merely will\r\nnot go. I merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play. I\r\nalso beg to return you your five hundred gülden. Farewell.”\r\n\r\nLaying the money upon a little table which the Grandmother’s chair\r\nhappened to be passing, I bowed and withdrew. “What folly!” the Grandmother shouted after me. “Very well, then. Do\r\nnot come, and I will find my way alone. Potapitch, you must come with\r\nme.

She had lost all the money which,\r\nearlier in the day, I had got for her paper securities—a sum amounting\r\nto about ten thousand roubles. This she did under the direction of the\r\nPole whom, that afternoon, she had dowered with two ten-gülden pieces. But before his arrival on the scene, she had commanded Potapitch to\r\nstake for her; until at length she had told him also to go about his\r\nbusiness. Upon that the Pole had leapt into the breach. Not only did it\r\nhappen that he knew the Russian language, but also he could speak a\r\nmixture of three different dialects, so that the pair were able to\r\nunderstand one another. Yet the old lady never ceased to abuse him,\r\ndespite his deferential manner, and to compare him unfavourably with\r\nmyself (so, at all events, Potapitch declared). “_You_,” the old\r\nchamberlain said to me, “treated her as a gentleman should, but he—he\r\nrobbed her right and left, as I could see with my own eyes. Twice she\r\ncaught him at it, and rated him soundly. On one occasion she even\r\npulled his hair, so that the bystanders burst out laughing. Yet she\r\nlost everything, sir—that is to say, she lost all that you had changed\r\nfor her. Then we brought her home, and, after asking for some water and\r\nsaying her prayers, she went to bed. So worn out was she that she fell\r\nasleep at once. May God send her dreams of angels! And _this_ is all\r\nthat foreign travel has done for us! Oh, my own Moscow! For what have\r\nwe not at home there, in Moscow? Such a garden and flowers as you could\r\nnever see here, and fresh air and apple-trees coming into blossom,—and\r\na beautiful view to look upon. Ah, but what must she do but go\r\ntravelling abroad? Alack, alack!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost a month has passed since I last touched these notes—notes which\r\nI began under the influence of impressions at once poignant and\r\ndisordered. The crisis which I then felt to be approaching has now\r\narrived, but in a form a hundred times more extensive and unexpected\r\nthan I had looked for. To me it all seems strange, uncouth, and tragic. Certain occurrences have befallen me which border upon the marvellous. At all events, that is how I view them. I view them so in one regard at\r\nleast. I refer to the whirlpool of events in which, at the time, I was\r\nrevolving. But the most curious feature of all is my relation to those\r\nevents, for hitherto I had never clearly understood myself. Yet now the\r\nactual crisis has passed away like a dream. Even my passion for Polina\r\nis dead. _Was_ it ever so strong and genuine as I thought? If so, what\r\nhas become of it now? At times I fancy that I must be mad; that\r\nsomewhere I am sitting in a madhouse; that these events have merely\r\n_seemed_ to happen; that still they merely _seem_ to be happening. I have been arranging and re-perusing my notes (perhaps for the purpose\r\nof convincing myself that I am not in a madhouse). At present I am\r\nlonely and alone. Autumn is coming—already it is mellowing the leaves;\r\nand, as I sit brooding in this melancholy little town (and how\r\nmelancholy the little towns of Germany can be!), I find myself taking\r\nno thought for the future, but living under the influence of passing\r\nmoods, and of my recollections of the tempest which recently drew me\r\ninto its vortex, and then cast me out again. At times I seem still to\r\nbe caught within that vortex.

Though polite\r\nenough to the old lady, he took a high hand with the bystanders. In\r\nshort, he offered himself less as a servant than as an _entertainer_. After each round he would turn to the old lady, and swear terrible\r\noaths to the effect that he was a “Polish gentleman of honour” who\r\nwould scorn to take a kopeck of her money; and, though he repeated\r\nthese oaths so often that at length she grew alarmed, he had her play\r\nin hand, and began to win on her behalf; wherefore, she felt that she\r\ncould not well get rid of him. An hour later the two Poles who, earlier\r\nin the day, had been expelled from the Casino, made a reappearance\r\nbehind the old lady’s chair, and renewed their offers of service—even\r\nif it were only to be sent on messages; but from Potapitch I\r\nsubsequently had it that between these rascals and the said “gentleman\r\nof honour” there passed a wink, as well as that the latter put\r\nsomething into their hands. Next, since the Grandmother had not yet\r\nlunched—she had scarcely for a moment left her chair—one of the two\r\nPoles ran to the restaurant of the Casino, and brought her thence a cup\r\nof soup, and afterwards some tea. In fact, _both_ the Poles hastened to\r\nperform this office. Finally, towards the close of the day, when it was\r\nclear that the Grandmother was about to play her last bank-note, there\r\ncould be seen standing behind her chair no fewer than six natives of\r\nPoland—persons who, as yet, had been neither audible nor visible; and\r\nas soon as ever the old lady played the note in question, they took no\r\nfurther notice of her, but pushed their way past her chair to the\r\ntable; seized the money, and staked it—shouting and disputing the\r\nwhile, and arguing with the “gentleman of honour” (who also had\r\nforgotten the Grandmother’s existence), as though he were their equal. Even when the Grandmother had lost her all, and was returning (about\r\neight o’clock) to the hotel, some three or four Poles could not bring\r\nthemselves to leave her, but went on running beside her chair and\r\nvolubly protesting that the Grandmother had cheated them, and that she\r\nought to be made to surrender what was not her own. Thus the party\r\narrived at the hotel; whence, presently, the gang of rascals was\r\nejected neck and crop. According to Potapitch’s calculations, the Grandmother lost, that day,\r\na total of ninety thousand roubles, in addition to the money which she\r\nhad lost the day before. Every paper security which she had brought\r\nwith her—five percent bonds, internal loan scrip, and what not—she had\r\nchanged into cash.

But the General, quaking and greatly apprehensive as\r\nto his possible future, overdid things. After half an hour’s prayers\r\nand entreaties, coupled with a full confession of his debts, and even\r\nof his passion for Mlle. Blanche (yes, he had quite lost his head), he\r\nsuddenly adopted a tone of menace, and started to rage at the old\r\nlady—exclaiming that she was sullying the family honour, that she was\r\nmaking a public scandal of herself, and that she was smirching the fair\r\nname of Russia. The upshot was that the Grandmother turned him out of\r\nthe room with her stick (it was a real stick, too!). Later in the\r\nmorning he held several consultations with De Griers—the question which\r\noccupied him being: Is it in any way possible to make use of the\r\npolice—to tell them that “this respected, but unfortunate, old lady has\r\ngone out of her mind, and is squandering her last kopeck,” or something\r\nof the kind? In short, is it in any way possible to engineer a species\r\nof supervision over, or of restraint upon, the old lady? De Griers,\r\nhowever, shrugged his shoulders at this, and laughed in the General’s\r\nface, while the old warrior went on chattering volubly, and running up\r\nand down his study. Finally De Griers waved his hand, and disappeared\r\nfrom view; and by evening it became known that he had left the hotel,\r\nafter holding a very secret and important conference with Mlle. Blanche. As for the latter, from early morning she had taken decisive\r\nmeasures, by completely excluding the General from her presence, and\r\nbestowing upon him not a glance. Indeed, even when the General pursued\r\nher to the Casino, and met her walking arm in arm with the Prince, he\r\n(the General) received from her and her mother not the slightest\r\nrecognition. Nor did the Prince himself bow. The rest of the day Mlle. spent in probing the Prince, and trying to make him declare himself;\r\nbut in this she made a woeful mistake. The little incident occurred in\r\nthe evening. Suddenly Mlle. Blanche realised that the Prince had not\r\neven a copper to his name, but, on the contrary, was minded to borrow\r\nof her money wherewith to play at roulette. In high displeasure she\r\ndrove him from her presence, and shut herself up in her room. The same morning I went to see—or, rather, to look for—Mr. Astley, but\r\nwas unsuccessful in my quest. Neither in his rooms nor in the Casino\r\nnor in the Park was he to be found; nor did he, that day, lunch at his\r\nhotel as usual. However, at about five o’clock I caught sight of him\r\nwalking from the railway station to the Hôtel d’Angleterre. He seemed\r\nto be in a great hurry and much preoccupied, though in his face I could\r\ndiscern no actual traces of worry or perturbation. He held out to me a\r\nfriendly hand, with his usual ejaculation of “Ah!” but did not check\r\nhis stride. I turned and walked beside him, but found, somehow, that\r\nhis answers forbade any putting of definite questions. Moreover, I felt\r\nreluctant to speak to him of Polina; nor, for his part, did he ask me\r\nany questions concerning her, although, on my telling him of the\r\nGrandmother’s exploits, he listened attentively and gravely, and then\r\nshrugged his shoulders. “She is gambling away everything that she has,” I remarked. “Indeed? She arrived at the Casino even before I had taken my departure\r\nby train, so I knew she had been playing. If I should have time I will\r\ngo to the Casino to-night, and take a look at her. The thing interests\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you been today?” I asked—surprised at myself for having, as\r\nyet, omitted to put to him that question. “To Frankfort.”\r\n\r\n“On business?”\r\n\r\n“On business.”\r\n\r\nWhat more was there to be asked after that?", "sentences": ["In other words, on learning that the old lady\r\nhad changed her mind about departing, and was bent on setting out for\r\nthe Casino again, the whole of our gang (Polina only excepted)\r\nproceeded en masse to her rooms, for the purpose of finally and frankly\r\ntreating with her.", "But the General, quaking and greatly apprehensive as\r\nto his possible future, overdid things.", "After half an hour’s prayers\r\nand entreaties, coupled with a full confession of his debts, and even\r\nof his passion for Mlle.", "Blanche (yes, he had quite lost his head), he\r\nsuddenly adopted a tone of menace, and started to rage at the old\r\nlady—exclaiming that she was sullying the family honour, that she was\r\nmaking a public scandal of herself, and that she was smirching the fair\r\nname of Russia.", "The upshot was that the Grandmother turned him out of\r\nthe room with her stick (it was a real stick, too!).", "Later in the\r\nmorning he held several consultations with De Griers—the question which\r\noccupied him being: Is it in any way possible to make use of the\r\npolice—to tell them that “this respected, but unfortunate, old lady has\r\ngone out of her mind, and is squandering her last kopeck,” or something\r\nof the kind?", "In short, is it in any way possible to engineer a species\r\nof supervision over, or of restraint upon, the old lady?", "De Griers,\r\nhowever, shrugged his shoulders at this, and laughed in the General’s\r\nface, while the old warrior went on chattering volubly, and running up\r\nand down his study.", "Finally De Griers waved his hand, and disappeared\r\nfrom view; and by evening it became known that he had left the hotel,\r\nafter holding a very secret and important conference with Mlle.", "Blanche.", "As for the latter, from early morning she had taken decisive\r\nmeasures, by completely excluding the General from her presence, and\r\nbestowing upon him not a glance.", "Indeed, even when the General pursued\r\nher to the Casino, and met her walking arm in arm with the Prince, he\r\n(the General) received from her and her mother not the slightest\r\nrecognition.", "Nor did the Prince himself bow.", "The rest of the day Mlle.", "spent in probing the Prince, and trying to make him declare himself;\r\nbut in this she made a woeful mistake.", "The little incident occurred in\r\nthe evening.", "Suddenly Mlle.", "Blanche realised that the Prince had not\r\neven a copper to his name, but, on the contrary, was minded to borrow\r\nof her money wherewith to play at roulette.", "In high displeasure she\r\ndrove him from her presence, and shut herself up in her room.", "The same morning I went to see—or, rather, to look for—Mr.", "Astley, but\r\nwas unsuccessful in my quest.", "Neither in his rooms nor in the Casino\r\nnor in the Park was he to be found; nor did he, that day, lunch at his\r\nhotel as usual.", "However, at about five o’clock I caught sight of him\r\nwalking from the railway station to the Hôtel d’Angleterre.", "He seemed\r\nto be in a great hurry and much preoccupied, though in his face I could\r\ndiscern no actual traces of worry or perturbation.", "He held out to me a\r\nfriendly hand, with his usual ejaculation of “Ah!” but did not check\r\nhis stride.", "I turned and walked beside him, but found, somehow, that\r\nhis answers forbade any putting of definite questions.", "Moreover, I felt\r\nreluctant to speak to him of Polina; nor, for his part, did he ask me\r\nany questions concerning her, although, on my telling him of the\r\nGrandmother’s exploits, he listened attentively and gravely, and then\r\nshrugged his shoulders.", "“She is gambling away everything that she has,” I remarked.", "“Indeed?", "She arrived at the Casino even before I had taken my departure\r\nby train, so I knew she had been playing.", "If I should have time I will\r\ngo to the Casino to-night, and take a look at her.", "The thing interests\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you been today?” I asked—surprised at myself for having, as\r\nyet, omitted to put to him that question.", "“To Frankfort.”\r\n\r\n“On business?”\r\n\r\n“On business.”\r\n\r\nWhat more was there to be asked after that?"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_61", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 61)", "language": "de", "content": "I accompanied him until, as\r\nwe drew level with the Hotel des Quatre Saisons, he suddenly nodded to\r\nme and disappeared. For myself, I returned home, and came to the\r\nconclusion that, even had I met him at two o’clock in the afternoon, I\r\nshould have learnt no more from him than I had done at five o’clock,\r\nfor the reason that I had no definite question to ask. It was bound to\r\nhave been so. For me to formulate the query which I really wished to\r\nput was a simple impossibility. Polina spent the whole of that day either in walking about the park\r\nwith the nurse and children or in sitting in her own room. For a long\r\nwhile past she had avoided the General and had scarcely had a word to\r\nsay to him (scarcely a word, I mean, on any _serious_ topic). Yes, that\r\nI had noticed. Still, even though I was aware of the position in which\r\nthe General was placed, it had never occurred to me that he would have\r\nany reason to avoid _her_, or to trouble her with family explanations. Indeed, when I was returning to the hotel after my conversation with\r\nAstley, and chanced to meet Polina and the children, I could see that\r\nher face was as calm as though the family disturbances had never\r\ntouched her. To my salute she responded with a slight bow, and I\r\nretired to my room in a very bad humour. Of course, since the affair with the Burmergelms I had exchanged not a\r\nword with Polina, nor had with her any kind of intercourse. Yet I had\r\nbeen at my wits’ end, for, as time went on, there was arising in me an\r\never-seething dissatisfaction. Even if she did not love me she ought\r\nnot to have trampled upon my feelings, nor to have accepted my\r\nconfessions with such contempt, seeing that she must have been aware\r\nthat I loved her (of her own accord she had allowed me to tell her as\r\nmuch). Of course the situation between us had arisen in a curious\r\nmanner. About two months ago, I had noticed that she had a desire to\r\nmake me her friend, her confidant—that she was making trial of me for\r\nthe purpose; but, for some reason or another, the desired result had\r\nnever come about, and we had fallen into the present strange relations,\r\nwhich had led me to address her as I had done. At the same time, if my\r\nlove was distasteful to her, why had she not _forbidden_ me to speak of\r\nit to her? But she had not so forbidden me. On the contrary, there had been\r\noccasions when she had even _invited_ me to speak. Of course, this\r\nmight have been done out of sheer wantonness, for I well knew—I had\r\nremarked it only too often—that, after listening to what I had to say,\r\nand angering me almost beyond endurance, she loved suddenly to torture\r\nme with some fresh outburst of contempt and aloofness! Yet she must\r\nhave known that I could not live without her. Three days had elapsed\r\nsince the affair with the Baron, and I could bear the severance no\r\nlonger. When, that afternoon, I met her near the Casino, my heart\r\nalmost made me faint, it beat so violently. She too could not live\r\nwithout me, for had she not said that she had _need_ of me? Or had that\r\ntoo been spoken in jest? That she had a secret of some kind there could be no doubt. What she\r\nhad said to the Grandmother had stabbed me to the heart. On a thousand\r\noccasions I had challenged her to be open with me, nor could she have\r\nbeen ignorant that I was ready to give my very life for her. Yet always\r\nshe had kept me at a distance with that contemptuous air of hers; or\r\nelse she had demanded of me, in lieu of the life which I offered to lay\r\nat her feet, such escapades as I had perpetrated with the Baron. Ah,\r\nwas it not torture to me, all this? For could it be that her whole\r\nworld was bound up with the Frenchman? What, too, about Mr. Astley? The\r\naffair was inexplicable throughout. My God, what distress it caused me! Arrived home, I, in a fit of frenzy, indited the following:\r\n\r\n“Polina Alexandrovna, I can see that there is approaching us an\r\nexposure which will involve you too.", "sentences": ["I accompanied him until, as\r\nwe drew level with the Hotel des Quatre Saisons, he suddenly nodded to\r\nme and disappeared.", "For myself, I returned home, and came to the\r\nconclusion that, even had I met him at two o’clock in the afternoon, I\r\nshould have learnt no more from him than I had done at five o’clock,\r\nfor the reason that I had no definite question to ask.", "It was bound to\r\nhave been so.", "For me to formulate the query which I really wished to\r\nput was a simple impossibility.", "Polina spent the whole of that day either in walking about the park\r\nwith the nurse and children or in sitting in her own room.", "For a long\r\nwhile past she had avoided the General and had scarcely had a word to\r\nsay to him (scarcely a word, I mean, on any _serious_ topic).", "Yes, that\r\nI had noticed.", "Still, even though I was aware of the position in which\r\nthe General was placed, it had never occurred to me that he would have\r\nany reason to avoid _her_, or to trouble her with family explanations.", "Indeed, when I was returning to the hotel after my conversation with\r\nAstley, and chanced to meet Polina and the children, I could see that\r\nher face was as calm as though the family disturbances had never\r\ntouched her.", "To my salute she responded with a slight bow, and I\r\nretired to my room in a very bad humour.", "Of course, since the affair with the Burmergelms I had exchanged not a\r\nword with Polina, nor had with her any kind of intercourse.", "Yet I had\r\nbeen at my wits’ end, for, as time went on, there was arising in me an\r\never-seething dissatisfaction.", "Even if she did not love me she ought\r\nnot to have trampled upon my feelings, nor to have accepted my\r\nconfessions with such contempt, seeing that she must have been aware\r\nthat I loved her (of her own accord she had allowed me to tell her as\r\nmuch).", "Of course the situation between us had arisen in a curious\r\nmanner.", "About two months ago, I had noticed that she had a desire to\r\nmake me her friend, her confidant—that she was making trial of me for\r\nthe purpose; but, for some reason or another, the desired result had\r\nnever come about, and we had fallen into the present strange relations,\r\nwhich had led me to address her as I had done.", "At the same time, if my\r\nlove was distasteful to her, why had she not _forbidden_ me to speak of\r\nit to her?", "But she had not so forbidden me.", "On the contrary, there had been\r\noccasions when she had even _invited_ me to speak.", "Of course, this\r\nmight have been done out of sheer wantonness, for I well knew—I had\r\nremarked it only too often—that, after listening to what I had to say,\r\nand angering me almost beyond endurance, she loved suddenly to torture\r\nme with some fresh outburst of contempt and aloofness!", "Yet she must\r\nhave known that I could not live without her.", "Three days had elapsed\r\nsince the affair with the Baron, and I could bear the severance no\r\nlonger.", "When, that afternoon, I met her near the Casino, my heart\r\nalmost made me faint, it beat so violently.", "She too could not live\r\nwithout me, for had she not said that she had _need_ of me?", "Or had that\r\ntoo been spoken in jest?", "That she had a secret of some kind there could be no doubt.", "What she\r\nhad said to the Grandmother had stabbed me to the heart.", "On a thousand\r\noccasions I had challenged her to be open with me, nor could she have\r\nbeen ignorant that I was ready to give my very life for her.", "Yet always\r\nshe had kept me at a distance with that contemptuous air of hers; or\r\nelse she had demanded of me, in lieu of the life which I offered to lay\r\nat her feet, such escapades as I had perpetrated with the Baron.", "Ah,\r\nwas it not torture to me, all this?", "For could it be that her whole\r\nworld was bound up with the Frenchman?", "What, too, about Mr.", "Astley?", "The\r\naffair was inexplicable throughout.", "My God, what distress it caused me!", "Arrived home, I, in a fit of frenzy, indited the following:\r\n\r\n“Polina Alexandrovna, I can see that there is approaching us an\r\nexposure which will involve you too."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_62", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 62)", "language": "de", "content": "For the last time I ask of\r\nyou—have you, or have you not, any need of my life? If you have, then\r\nmake such dispositions as you wish, and I shall always be discoverable\r\nin my room if required. If you have need of my life, write or send for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nI sealed the letter, and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor\r\nlacquey, with orders to hand it to the addressee in person. Though I\r\nexpected no answer, scarcely three minutes had elapsed before the\r\nlacquey returned with “the compliments of a certain person.”\r\n\r\nNext, about seven o’clock, I was sent for by the General. I found him\r\nin his study, apparently preparing to go out again, for his hat and\r\nstick were lying on the sofa. When I entered he was standing in the\r\nmiddle of the room—his feet wide apart, and his head bent down. Also,\r\nhe appeared to be talking to himself. But as soon as ever he saw me at\r\nthe door he came towards me in such a curious manner that involuntarily\r\nI retreated a step, and was for leaving the room; whereupon he seized\r\nme by both hands, and, drawing me towards the sofa, and seating himself\r\nthereon, he forced me to sit down on a chair opposite him. Then,\r\nwithout letting go of my hands, he exclaimed with quivering lips and a\r\nsparkle of tears on his eyelashes:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Alexis Ivanovitch! Save me, save me! Have some mercy upon me!”\r\n\r\nFor a long time I could not make out what he meant, although he kept\r\ntalking and talking, and constantly repeating to himself, “Have mercy,\r\nmercy!” At length, however, I divined that he was expecting me to give\r\nhim something in the nature of advice—or, rather, that, deserted by\r\nevery one, and overwhelmed with grief and apprehension, he had\r\nbethought himself of my existence, and sent for me to relieve his\r\nfeelings by talking and talking and talking. In fact, he was in such a confused and despondent state of mind that,\r\nclasping his hands together, he actually went down upon his knees and\r\nbegged me to go to Mlle. Blanche, and beseech and advise her to return\r\nto him, and to accept him in marriage. “But, General,” I exclaimed, “possibly Mlle. Blanche has scarcely even\r\nremarked my existence? What could _I_ do with her?”\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that I protested, for he could understand nothing that\r\nwas said to him, Next he started talking about the Grandmother, but\r\nalways in a disconnected sort of fashion—his one thought being to send\r\nfor the police. “In Russia,” said he, suddenly boiling over with indignation, “or in\r\nany well-ordered State where there exists a government, old women like\r\nmy mother are placed under proper guardianship. Yes, my good sir,” he\r\nwent on, relapsing into a scolding tone as he leapt to his feet and\r\nstarted to pace the room, “do you not know this” (he seemed to be\r\naddressing some imaginary auditor in the corner) “—do you not know\r\nthis, that in Russia old women like her are subjected to restraint, the\r\ndevil take them?” Again he threw himself down upon the sofa. A minute later, though sobbing and almost breathless, he managed to\r\ngasp out that Mlle. Blanche had refused to marry him, for the reason\r\nthat the Grandmother had turned up in place of a telegram, and it was\r\ntherefore clear that he had no inheritance to look for. Evidently, he\r\nsupposed that I had hitherto been in entire ignorance of all this. Again, when I referred to De Griers, the General made a gesture of\r\ndespair. “He has gone away,” he said, “and everything which I possess\r\nis mortgaged to him. I stand stripped to my skin. Even of the money\r\nwhich you brought me from Paris, I know not if seven hundred francs be\r\nleft. Of course that sum will do to go on with, but, as regards the\r\nfuture, I know nothing, I know nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then how will you pay your hotel bill?” I cried in consternation. “And\r\nwhat shall you do afterwards?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me vaguely, but it was clear that he had not\r\nunderstood—perhaps had not even heard—my questions.", "sentences": ["For the last time I ask of\r\nyou—have you, or have you not, any need of my life?", "If you have, then\r\nmake such dispositions as you wish, and I shall always be discoverable\r\nin my room if required.", "If you have need of my life, write or send for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nI sealed the letter, and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor\r\nlacquey, with orders to hand it to the addressee in person.", "Though I\r\nexpected no answer, scarcely three minutes had elapsed before the\r\nlacquey returned with “the compliments of a certain person.”\r\n\r\nNext, about seven o’clock, I was sent for by the General.", "I found him\r\nin his study, apparently preparing to go out again, for his hat and\r\nstick were lying on the sofa.", "When I entered he was standing in the\r\nmiddle of the room—his feet wide apart, and his head bent down.", "Also,\r\nhe appeared to be talking to himself.", "But as soon as ever he saw me at\r\nthe door he came towards me in such a curious manner that involuntarily\r\nI retreated a step, and was for leaving the room;

Blanche. “What on earth\r\nam I to do?” he concluded. “What on earth am I to do? Is this not\r\ningratitude? Is it not sheer ingratitude?” And he burst into tears. Nothing could be done with such a man. Yet to leave him alone was\r\ndangerous, for something might happen to him. I withdrew from his rooms\r\nfor a little while, but warned the nursemaid to keep an eye upon him,\r\nas well as exchanged a word with the corridor lacquey (a very talkative\r\nfellow), who likewise promised to remain on the look-out. Hardly had I left the General, when Potapitch approached me with a\r\nsummons from the Grandmother. It was now eight o’clock, and she had\r\nreturned from the Casino after finally losing all that she possessed. I\r\nfound her sitting in her chair—much distressed and evidently fatigued. Presently Martha brought her up a cup of tea and forced her to drink\r\nit; yet, even then I could detect in the old lady’s tone and manner a\r\ngreat change. “Good evening, Alexis Ivanovitch,” she said slowly, with her head\r\ndrooping. “Pardon me for disturbing you again. Yes, you must pardon an\r\nold, old woman like myself, for I have left behind me all that I\r\npossess—nearly a hundred thousand roubles! You did quite right in\r\ndeclining to come with me this evening. Now I am without money—without\r\na single groat. But I must not delay a moment; I must leave by the 9:30\r\ntrain. I have sent for that English friend of yours, and am going to\r\nbeg of him three thousand francs for a week. Please try and persuade\r\nhim to think nothing of it, nor yet to refuse me, for I am still a rich\r\nwoman who possesses three villages and a couple of mansions. Yes, the\r\nmoney shall be found, for I have not yet squandered _everything_. I\r\ntell you this in order that he may have no doubts about—Ah, but here he\r\nis! Clearly he is a good fellow.”\r\n\r\nTrue enough, Astley had come hot-foot on receiving the Grandmother’s\r\nappeal. Scarcely stopping even to reflect, and with scarcely a word, he\r\ncounted out the three thousand francs under a note of hand which she\r\nduly signed. Then, his business done, he bowed, and lost no time in\r\ntaking his departure. “You too leave me, Alexis Ivanovitch,” said the Grandmother. “All my\r\nbones are aching, and I still have an hour in which to rest. Do not be\r\nhard upon me, old fool that I am. Never again shall I blame young\r\npeople for being frivolous. I should think it wrong even to blame that\r\nunhappy General of yours. Nevertheless, I do not mean to let him have\r\nany of my money (which is all that he desires), for the reason that I\r\nlook upon him as a perfect blockhead, and consider myself, simpleton\r\nthough I be, at least wiser than _he_ is. How surely does God visit old\r\nage, and punish it for its presumption! Well, good-bye. Martha, come\r\nand lift me up.”\r\n\r\nHowever, I had a mind to see the old lady off; and, moreover, I was in\r\nan expectant frame of mind—somehow I kept thinking that _something_ was\r\ngoing to happen; wherefore, I could not rest quietly in my room, but\r\nstepped out into the corridor, and then into the Chestnut Avenue for a\r\nfew minutes’ stroll. My letter to Polina had been clear and firm, and\r\nin the present crisis, I felt sure, would prove final. I had heard of\r\nDe Griers’ departure, and, however much Polina might reject me as a\r\n_friend_, she might not reject me altogether as a _servant_. She would\r\nneed me to fetch and carry for her, and I was ready to do so. How could\r\nit have been otherwise? Towards the hour of the train’s departure I hastened to the station,\r\nand put the Grandmother into her compartment—she and her party\r\noccupying a reserved family saloon. “Thanks for your disinterested assistance,” she said at parting. “Oh,\r\nand please remind Prascovia of what I said to her last night.", "sentences": ["Then I tried to get\r\nhim to speak of Polina and the children, but he only returned brief\r\nanswers of “Yes, yes,” and again started to maunder about the Prince,\r\nand the likelihood of the latter marrying Mlle.", "Blanche.", "“What on earth\r\nam I to do?” he concluded.", "“What on earth am I to do?", "Is this not\r\ningratitude?", "Is it not sheer ingratitude?” And he burst into tears.", "Nothing could be done with such a man.", "Yet to leave him alone was\r\ndangerous, for something might happen to him.", "I withdrew from his rooms\r\nfor a little while, but warned the nursemaid to keep an eye upon him,\r\nas well as exchanged a word with the corridor lacquey (a very talkative\r\nfellow), who likewise promised to remain on the look-out.", "Hardly had I left the General, when Potapitch approached me with a\r\nsummons from the Grandmother.", "It was now eight o’clock, and she had\r\nreturned from the Casino after finally losing all that she possessed.", "I\r\nfound her sitting in her chair—much distressed and evidently fatigued.", "Presently Martha brought her up a cup of tea and forced her to drink\r\nit; yet, even then I could detect in the old lady’s tone and manner a\r\ngreat change.", "“Good evening, Alexis Ivanovitch,” she said slowly, with her head\r\ndrooping.", "“Pardon me for disturbing you again.", "Yes, you must pardon an\r\nold, old woman like myself, for I have left behind me all that I\r\npossess—nearly a hundred thousand roubles!", "You did quite right in\r\ndeclining to come with me this evening.", "Now I am without money—without\r\na single groat.", "But I must not delay a moment; I must leave by the 9:30\r\ntrain.", "I have sent for that English friend of yours, and am going to\r\nbeg of him three thousand francs for a week.", "Please try and persuade\r\nhim to think nothing of it, nor yet to refuse me, for I am still a rich\r\nwoman who possesses three villages and a couple of mansions.", "Yes, the\r\nmoney shall be found, for I have not yet squandered _everything_.", "I\r\ntell you this in order that he may have no doubts about—Ah, but here he\r\nis!", "Clearly he is a good fellow.”\r\n\r\nTrue enough, Astley had come hot-foot on receiving the Grandmother’s\r\nappeal.", "Scarcely stopping even to reflect, and with scarcely a word, he\r\ncounted out the three thousand francs under a note of hand which she\r\nduly signed.", "Then, his business done, he bowed, and lost no time in\r\ntaking his departure.", "“You too leave me, Alexis Ivanovitch,” said the Grandmother.", "“All my\r\nbones are aching, and I still have an hour in which to rest.", "Do not be\r\nhard upon me, old fool that I am.", "Never again shall I blame young\r\npeople for being frivolous.", "I should think it wrong even to blame that\r\nunhappy General of yours.", "Nevertheless, I do not mean to let him have\r\nany of my money (which is all that he desires), for the reason that I\r\nlook upon him as a perfect blockhead, and consider myself, simpleton\r\nthough I be, at least wiser than _he_ is.", "How surely does God visit old\r\nage, and punish it for its presumption!", "Well, good-bye.", "Martha, come\r\nand lift me up.”\r\n\r\nHowever, I had a mind to see the old lady off; and, moreover, I was in\r\nan expectant frame of mind—somehow I kept thinking that _something_ was\r\ngoing to happen; wherefore, I could not rest quietly in my room, but\r\nstepped out into the corridor, and then into the Chestnut Avenue for a\r\nfew minutes’ stroll.", "My letter to Polina had been clear and firm, and\r\nin the present crisis, I felt sure, would prove final.", "I had heard of\r\nDe Griers’ departure, and, however much Polina might reject me as a\r\n_friend_, she might not reject me altogether as a _servant_.", "She would\r\nneed me to fetch and carry for her, and I was ready to do so.", "How could\r\nit have been otherwise?", "Towards the hour of the train’s departure I hastened to the station,\r\nand put the Grandmother into her compartment—she and her party\r\noccupying a reserved family saloon.", "“Thanks for your disinterested assistance,” she said at parting.", "“Oh,\r\nand please remind Prascovia of what I said to her last night."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_64", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 64)", "language": "de", "content": "I expect\r\nsoon to see her.”\r\n\r\nThen I returned home. As I was passing the door of the General’s suite,\r\nI met the nursemaid, and inquired after her master. “There is nothing\r\nnew to report, sir,” she replied quietly. Nevertheless I decided to\r\nenter, and was just doing so when I halted thunderstruck on the\r\nthreshold. For before me I beheld the General and Mlle. Blanche—laughing gaily at one another!—while beside them, on the sofa,\r\nthere was seated her mother. Clearly the General was almost out of his\r\nmind with joy, for he was talking all sorts of nonsense, and bubbling\r\nover with a long-drawn, nervous laugh—a laugh which twisted his face\r\ninto innumerable wrinkles, and caused his eyes almost to disappear. Afterwards I learnt from Mlle. Blanche herself that, after dismissing\r\nthe Prince and hearing of the General’s tears, she bethought her of\r\ngoing to comfort the old man, and had just arrived for the purpose when\r\nI entered. Fortunately, the poor General did not know that his fate had\r\nbeen decided—that Mlle. had long ago packed her trunks in readiness for\r\nthe first morning train to Paris! Hesitating a moment on the threshold I changed my mind as to entering,\r\nand departed unnoticed. Ascending to my own room, and opening the door,\r\nI perceived in the semi-darkness a figure seated on a chair in the\r\ncorner by the window. The figure did not rise when I entered, so I\r\napproached it swiftly, peered at it closely, and felt my heart almost\r\nstop beating. The figure was Polina! XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shock made me utter an exclamation. “What is the matter? What is the matter?” she asked in a strange voice. She was looking pale, and her eyes were dim. “What is the matter?” I re-echoed. “Why, the fact that you are _here!_”\r\n\r\n“If I am here, I have come with all that I have to bring,” she said. “Such has always been my way, as you shall presently see. Please light\r\na candle.”\r\n\r\nI did so; whereupon she rose, approached the table, and laid upon it an\r\nopen letter. “Read it,” she added. “It is De Griers’ handwriting!” I cried as I seized the document. My\r\nhands were so tremulous that the lines on the pages danced before my\r\neyes. Although, at this distance of time, I have forgotten the exact\r\nphraseology of the missive, I append, if not the precise words, at all\r\nevents the general sense. “Mademoiselle,” the document ran, “certain untoward circumstances\r\ncompel me to depart in haste. Of course, you have of yourself remarked\r\nthat hitherto I have always refrained from having any final explanation\r\nwith you, for the reason that I could not well state the whole\r\ncircumstances; and now to my difficulties the advent of the aged\r\nGrandmother, coupled with her subsequent proceedings, has put the final\r\ntouch.

He thought that possibly I should sue\r\nhim—that one day I might become a nuisance.” Here Polina halted for a\r\nmoment, and stood biting her lips. “So of set purpose I redoubled my\r\ncontemptuous treatment of him, and waited to see what he would do.

Well, what is the General going to do?” Then an\r\nidea suddenly occurred to me. “What about the Grandmother?” I asked. Polina looked at me with impatience and bewilderment. “What makes you speak of _her?_” was her irritable inquiry. “I cannot\r\ngo and live with her. Nor,” she added hotly, “will I go down upon my\r\nknees to _any one_.”\r\n\r\n“Why should you?” I cried. “Yet to think that you should have loved De\r\nGriers! The villain, the villain! But I will kill him in a duel. Where\r\nis he now?”\r\n\r\n“In Frankfort, where he will be staying for the next three days.”\r\n\r\n“Well, bid me do so, and I will go to him by the first train tomorrow,”\r\nI exclaimed with enthusiasm. She smiled. “If you were to do that,” she said, “he would merely tell you to be so\r\ngood as first to return him the fifty thousand francs. What, then,\r\nwould be the use of having a quarrel with him? You talk sheer\r\nnonsense.”\r\n\r\nI ground my teeth. “The question,” I went on, “is how to raise the fifty thousand francs. We cannot expect to find them lying about on the floor. Listen. What of\r\nMr. Astley?” Even as I spoke a new and strange idea formed itself in my\r\nbrain. Her eyes flashed fire. “What? _you yourself_ wish me to leave you for him?” she cried with a\r\nscornful look and a proud smile. Never before had she addressed me\r\nthus. Then her head must have turned dizzy with emotion, for suddenly she\r\nseated herself upon the sofa, as though she were powerless any longer\r\nto stand. A flash of lightning seemed to strike me as I stood there. I could\r\nscarcely believe my eyes or my ears. She _did_ love me, then! It _was_\r\nto me, and not to Mr. Astley, that she had turned! Although she, an\r\nunprotected girl, had come to me in my room—in an hotel room—and had\r\nprobably compromised herself thereby, I had not understood! Then a second mad idea flashed into my brain. “Polina,” I said, “give me but an hour. Wait here just one hour until I\r\nreturn. Yes, you MUST do so. Do you not see what I mean? Just stay here\r\nfor that time.”\r\n\r\nAnd I rushed from the room without so much as answering her look of\r\ninquiry. She called something after me, but I did not return. Sometimes it happens that the most insane thought, the most impossible\r\nconception, will become so fixed in one’s head that at length one\r\nbelieves the thought or the conception to be reality.

Although the\r\noccurrence can easily be explained by arithmetic, I still believe it to\r\nhave been a miracle. Yet why did this conviction take such a hold upon\r\nme at the time, and remain with me ever since? Previously, I had\r\nthought of the idea, not as an occurrence which was ever likely to come\r\nabout, but as something which _never_ could come about. The time was a quarter past eleven o’clock when I entered the Casino in\r\nsuch a state of hope (though, at the same time, of agitation) as I had\r\nnever before experienced. In the gaming-rooms there were still a large\r\nnumber of people, but not half as many as had been present in the\r\nmorning. At eleven o’clock there usually remained behind only the real, the\r\ndesperate gamblers—persons for whom, at spas, there existed nothing\r\nbeyond roulette, and who went thither for that alone. These gamesters\r\ntook little note of what was going on around them, and were interested\r\nin none of the appurtenances of the season, but played from morning\r\ntill night, and would have been ready to play through the night until\r\ndawn had that been possible. As it was, they used to disperse\r\nunwillingly when, at midnight, roulette came to an end. Likewise, as\r\nsoon as ever roulette was drawing to a close and the head croupier had\r\ncalled “Les trois derniers coups,” most of them were ready to stake on\r\nthe last three rounds all that they had in their pockets—and, for the\r\nmost part, lost it. For my own part I proceeded towards the table at\r\nwhich the Grandmother had lately sat; and, since the crowd around it\r\nwas not very large, I soon obtained standing room among the ring of\r\ngamblers, while directly in front of me, on the green cloth, I saw\r\nmarked the word “Passe.”\r\n\r\n“Passe” was a row of numbers from 19 to 36 inclusive; while a row of\r\nnumbers from 1 to 18 inclusive was known as “Manque.” But what had that\r\nto do with me? I had not noticed—I had not so much as heard the numbers\r\nupon which the previous coup had fallen, and so took no bearings when I\r\nbegan to play, as, in my place, any _systematic_ gambler would have\r\ndone. No, I merely extended my stock of twenty ten-gülden pieces, and\r\nthrew them down upon the space “Passe” which happened to be confronting\r\nme. “Vingt-deux!” called the croupier. I had won! I staked upon the same again—both my original stake and my\r\nwinnings. “Trente-et-un!” called the croupier. Again I had won, and was now in possession of eighty ten-gülden pieces. Next, I moved the whole eighty on to twelve middle numbers (a stake\r\nwhich, if successful, would bring me in a triple profit, but also\r\ninvolved a risk of two chances to one). The wheel revolved, and stopped\r\nat twenty-four. Upon this I was paid out notes and gold until I had by\r\nmy side a total sum of two thousand gülden. It was as in a fever that I moved the pile, en bloc, on to the red. Then suddenly I came to myself (though that was the only time during\r\nthe evening’s play when fear cast its cold spell over me, and showed\r\nitself in a trembling of the hands and knees). For with horror I had\r\nrealised that I _must_ win, and that upon that stake there depended all\r\nmy life. “Rouge!” called the croupier. I drew a long breath, and hot shivers\r\nwent coursing over my body.

Seizing up my last note for five hundred gülden, I contrived to\r\ninsinuate it, unperceived, into the hand of the pale lady. An\r\noverpowering impulse had made me do so, and I remember how her thin\r\nlittle fingers pressed mine in token of her lively gratitude. The whole\r\naffair was the work of a moment. Then, collecting my belongings, I crossed to where trente et quarante\r\nwas being played—a game which could boast of a more aristocratic\r\npublic, and was played with cards instead of with a wheel. At this\r\ndiversion the bank made itself responsible for a hundred thousand\r\nthalers as the limit, but the highest stake allowable was, as in\r\nroulette, four thousand florins. Although I knew nothing of the\r\ngame—and I scarcely knew the stakes, except those on black and red—I\r\njoined the ring of players, while the rest of the crowd massed itself\r\naround me. At this distance of time I cannot remember whether I ever\r\ngave a thought to Polina; I seemed only to be conscious of a vague\r\npleasure in seizing and raking in the bank-notes which kept massing\r\nthemselves in a pile before me. But, as ever, fortune seemed to be at my back. As though of set\r\npurpose, there came to my aid a circumstance which not infrequently\r\nrepeats itself in gaming. The circumstance is that not infrequently\r\nluck attaches itself to, say, the red, and does not leave it for a\r\nspace of say, ten, or even fifteen, rounds in succession. Three days\r\nago I had heard that, during the previous week there had been a run of\r\ntwenty-two coups on the red—an occurrence never before known at\r\nroulette—so that men spoke of it with astonishment. Naturally enough,\r\nmany deserted the red after a dozen rounds, and practically no one\r\ncould now be found to stake upon it. Yet upon the black also—the\r\nantithesis of the red—no experienced gambler would stake anything, for\r\nthe reason that every practised player knows the meaning of “capricious\r\nfortune.” That is to say, after the sixteenth (or so) success of the\r\nred, one would think that the seventeenth coup would inevitably fall\r\nupon the black; wherefore, novices would be apt to back the latter in\r\nthe seventeenth round, and even to double or treble their stakes upon\r\nit—only, in the end, to lose. Yet some whim or other led me, on remarking that the red had come up\r\nconsecutively for seven times, to attach myself to that colour. Probably this was mostly due to self-conceit, for I wanted to astonish\r\nthe bystanders with the riskiness of my play. Also, I remember that—oh,\r\nstrange sensation!—I suddenly, and without any challenge from my own\r\npresumption, became obsessed with a _desire_ to take risks. If the\r\nspirit has passed through a great many sensations, possibly it can no\r\nlonger be sated with them, but grows more excited, and demands more\r\nsensations, and stronger and stronger ones, until at length it falls\r\nexhausted. Certainly, if the rules of the game had permitted even of my\r\nstaking fifty thousand florins at a time, I should have staked them. All of a sudden I heard exclamations arising that the whole thing was a\r\nmarvel, since the red was turning up for the fourteenth time! “Monsieur a gagné cent mille florins,” a voice exclaimed beside me. I awoke to my senses. What? I had won a hundred thousand florins? If\r\nso, what more did I need to win? I grasped the banknotes, stuffed them\r\ninto my pockets, raked in the gold without counting it, and started to\r\nleave the Casino. As I passed through the salons people smiled to see\r\nmy bulging pockets and unsteady gait, for the weight which I was\r\ncarrying must have amounted to half a pood!

The Avenue was so dark that it was barely\r\npossible to distinguish one’s hand before one’s face, while the\r\ndistance to the hotel was half a verst or so; but I feared neither\r\npickpockets nor highwaymen. Indeed, never since my boyhood have I done\r\nthat. Also, I cannot remember what I thought about on the way. I only\r\nfelt a sort of fearful pleasure—the pleasure of success, of conquest,\r\nof power (how can I best express it?). Likewise, before me there\r\nflitted the image of Polina; and I kept remembering, and reminding\r\nmyself, that it was to _her_ I was going, that it was in _her_ presence\r\nI should soon be standing, that it was _she_ to whom I should soon be\r\nable to relate and show everything. Scarcely once did I recall what she\r\nhad lately said to me, or the reason why I had left her, or all those\r\nvaried sensations which I had been experiencing a bare hour and a half\r\nago. No, those sensations seemed to be things of the past, to be things\r\nwhich had righted themselves and grown old, to be things concerning\r\nwhich we needed to trouble ourselves no longer, since, for us, life was\r\nabout to begin anew. Yet I had just reached the end of the Avenue when\r\nthere _did_ come upon me a fear of being robbed or murdered. With each\r\nstep the fear increased until, in my terror, I almost started to run. Suddenly, as I issued from the Avenue, there burst upon me the lights\r\nof the hotel, sparkling with a myriad lamps! Yes, thanks be to God, I\r\nhad reached home! Running up to my room, I flung open the door of it. Polina was still on\r\nthe sofa, with a lighted candle in front of her, and her hands clasped. As I entered she stared at me in astonishment (for, at the moment, I\r\nmust have presented a strange spectacle). All I did, however, was to\r\nhalt before her, and fling upon the table my burden of wealth. XV\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember, too, how, without moving from her place, or changing her\r\nattitude, she gazed into my face. “I have won two hundred thousand francs!” cried I as I pulled out my\r\nlast sheaf of bank-notes. The pile of paper currency occupied the whole\r\ntable. I could not withdraw my eyes from it. Consequently, for a moment\r\nor two Polina escaped my mind. Then I set myself to arrange the pile in\r\norder, and to sort the notes, and to mass the gold in a separate heap. That done, I left everything where it lay, and proceeded to pace the\r\nroom with rapid strides as I lost myself in thought. Then I darted to\r\nthe table once more, and began to recount the money; until all of a\r\nsudden, as though I had remembered something, I rushed to the door, and\r\nclosed and double-locked it. Finally I came to a meditative halt before\r\nmy little trunk. “Shall I put the money there until tomorrow?” I asked, turning sharply\r\nround to Polina as the recollection of her returned to me. She was still in her old place—still making not a sound. Yet her eyes\r\nhad followed every one of my movements. Somehow in her face there was a\r\nstrange expression—an expression which I did not like. I think that I\r\nshall not be wrong if I say that it indicated sheer hatred. Impulsively I approached her. “Polina,” I said, “here are twenty-five thousand florins—fifty thousand\r\nfrancs, or more. Take them, and tomorrow throw them in De Griers’\r\nface.”\r\n\r\nShe returned no answer. “Or, if you should prefer,” I continued, “let me take them to him\r\nmyself tomorrow—yes, early tomorrow morning.

Somehow I had an intuition of something having\r\nhappened to her which had nothing to do with myself. She was like a\r\nperson temporarily insane. “Buy me, would you, would you? Would you buy me for fifty thousand\r\nfrancs as De Griers did?” she gasped between her convulsive sobs. I clasped her in my arms, kissed her hands and feet, and fell upon my\r\nknees before her. Presently the hysterical fit passed away, and, laying her hands upon my\r\nshoulders, she gazed for a while into my face, as though trying to read\r\nit—something I said to her, but it was clear that she did not hear it. Her face looked so dark and despondent that I began to fear for her\r\nreason. At length she drew me towards herself—a trustful smile playing\r\nover her features; and then, as suddenly, she pushed me away again as\r\nshe eyed me dimly.

Yes, she laughed and wept at the same time. What was I to do? I was like a man in a fever. I remember that she\r\nbegan to say something to me—though _what_ I do not know, since she\r\nspoke with a feverish lisp, as though she were trying to tell me\r\nsomething very quickly. At intervals, too, she would break off into the\r\nsmile which I was beginning to dread. “No, no!” she kept repeating. “_You_ are my dear one; _you_ are the man I trust.” Again she laid her\r\nhands upon my shoulders, and again she gazed at me as she reiterated:\r\n“You love me, you love me? Will you _always_ love me?” I could not take\r\nmy eyes off her. Never before had I seen her in this mood of humility\r\nand affection. True, the mood was the outcome of hysteria; but—! All of\r\na sudden she noticed my ardent gaze, and smiled slightly. The next\r\nmoment, for no apparent reason, she began to talk of Astley. She continued talking and talking about him, but I could not make out\r\nall she said—more particularly when she was endeavouring to tell me of\r\nsomething or other which had happened recently. On the whole, she\r\nappeared to be laughing at Astley, for she kept repeating that he was\r\nwaiting for her, and did I know whether, even at that moment, he was\r\nnot standing beneath the window? “Yes, yes, he is there,” she said. “Open the window, and see if he is not.” She pushed me in that\r\ndirection; yet, no sooner did I make a movement to obey her behest than\r\nshe burst into laughter, and I remained beside her, and she embraced\r\nme. “Shall we go away tomorrow?” presently she asked, as though some\r\ndisturbing thought had recurred to her recollection. “How would it be\r\nif we were to try and overtake Grandmamma? I think we should do so at\r\nBerlin. And what think you she would have to say to us when we caught\r\nher up, and her eyes first lit upon us? What, too, about Mr. Astley? _He_ would not leap from the Shlangenberg for my sake! No! Of that I am\r\nvery sure!”—and she laughed. “Do you know where he is going next year?

How sorry I am for them, and for\r\nGrandmamma! But when are you going to kill De Griers? Surely you do not\r\nintend actually to murder him? You fool! Do you suppose that I should\r\n_allow_ you to fight De Griers? Nor shall you kill the Baron.” Here she\r\nburst out laughing. “How absurd you looked when you were talking to the\r\nBurmergelms! I was watching you all the time—watching you from where I\r\nwas sitting. And how unwilling you were to go when I sent you! Oh, how\r\nI laughed and laughed!”\r\n\r\nThen she kissed and embraced me again; again she pressed her face to\r\nmine with tender passion. Yet I neither saw nor heard her, for my head\r\nwas in a whirl.... It must have been about seven o’clock in the morning when I awoke. Daylight had come, and Polina was sitting by my side—a strange\r\nexpression on her face, as though she had seen a vision and was unable\r\nto collect her thoughts. She too had just awoken, and was now staring\r\nat the money on the table. My head ached; it felt heavy. I attempted to\r\ntake Polina’s hand, but she pushed me from her, and leapt from the\r\nsofa. The dawn was full of mist, for rain had fallen, yet she moved to\r\nthe window, opened it, and, leaning her elbows upon the window-sill,\r\nthrust out her head and shoulders to take the air. In this position did\r\nshe remain for several minutes, without ever looking round at me, or\r\nlistening to what I was saying. Into my head there came the uneasy\r\nthought: What is to happen now? How is it all to end? Suddenly Polina\r\nrose from the window, approached the table, and, looking at me with an\r\nexpression of infinite aversion, said with lips which quivered with\r\nanger:\r\n\r\n“Well? Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs?”\r\n\r\n“Polina, you say that _again, again?_” I exclaimed. “You have changed your mind, then? Ha, ha, ha! You are sorry you ever\r\npromised them?”\r\n\r\nOn the table where, the previous night, I had counted the money there\r\nstill was lying the packet of twenty five thousand florins. I handed it\r\nto her. “The francs are mine, then, are they? They are mine?” she inquired\r\nviciously as she balanced the money in her hands. “Yes; they have _always_ been yours,” I said. “Then _take_ your fifty thousand francs!” and she hurled them full in\r\nmy face. The packet burst as she did so, and the floor became strewed\r\nwith bank-notes. The instant that the deed was done she rushed from the\r\nroom. At that moment she cannot have been in her right mind; yet, what was\r\nthe cause of her temporary aberration I cannot say. For a month past\r\nshe had been unwell. Yet what had brought about this _present_\r\ncondition of mind, above all things, this outburst? Had it come of\r\nwounded pride? Had it come of despair over her decision to come to me? Had it come of the fact that, presuming too much on my good fortune, I\r\nhad seemed to be intending to desert her (even as De Griers had done)\r\nwhen once I had given her the fifty thousand francs? But, on my honour,\r\nI had never cherished any such intention. What was at fault, I think,\r\nwas her own pride, which kept urging her not to trust me, but, rather,\r\nto insult me—even though she had not realised the fact. In her eyes I\r\ncorresponded to De Griers, and therefore had been condemned for a fault\r\nnot wholly my own. Her mood of late had been a sort of delirium, a sort\r\nof light-headedness—that I knew full well; yet, never had I\r\nsufficiently taken it into consideration. Perhaps she would not pardon\r\nme now? Ah, but this was _the present_. What about the future?", "sentences": ["Ha, ha, ha!", "He also\r\nsays that we Russians know nothing, can do nothing, without European\r\nhelp.", "But he is a good fellow all the same.", "For instance, he does not\r\nblame the General in the matter, but declares that Mlle.", "Blanche—that\r\nlove—But no; I do not know, I do not know.” She stopped suddenly, as\r\nthough she had said her say, and was feeling bewildered.", "“What poor\r\ncreatures these people are.", "How sorry I am for them, and for\r\nGrandmamma!", "But when are you going to kill De Griers?", "Surely you do not\r\nintend actually to murder him?", "You fool!", "Do you suppose that I should\r\n_allow_ you to fight De Griers?", "Nor shall you kill the Baron.” Here she\r\nburst out laughing.", "“How absurd you looked when you were talking to the\r\nBurmergelms!", "I was watching you all the time—watching you from where I\r\nwas sitting.", "And how unwilling you were to go when I sent you!", "Oh, how\r\nI laughed and laughed!”\r\n\r\nThen she kissed and embraced me again; again she pressed her face to\r\nmine with tender passion.", "Yet I neither saw nor heard her, for my head\r\nwas in a whirl....", "It must have been about seven o’clock in the morning when I awoke.", "Daylight had come, and Polina was sitting by my side—a strange\r\nexpression on her face, as though she had seen a vision and was unable\r\nto collect her thoughts.", "She too had just awoken, and was now staring\r\nat the money on the table.", "My head ached; it felt heavy.", "I attempted to\r\ntake Polina’s hand, but she pushed me from her, and leapt from the\r\nsofa.", "The dawn was full of mist, for rain had fallen, yet she moved to\r\nthe window, opened it, and, leaning her elbows upon the window-sill,\r\nthrust out her head and shoulders to take the air.", "In this position did\r\nshe remain for several minutes, without ever looking round at me, or\r\nlistening to what I was saying.", "Into my head there came the uneasy\r\nthought: What is to happen now?", "How is it all to end?", "Suddenly Polina\r\nrose from the window, approached the table, and, looking at me with an\r\nexpression of infinite aversion, said with lips which quivered with\r\nanger:\r\n\r\n“Well?", "Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs?”\r\n\r\n“Polina, you say that _again, again?_” I exclaimed.", "“You have changed your mind, then?", "Ha, ha, ha!", "You are sorry you ever\r\npromised them?”\r\n\r\nOn the table where, the previous night, I had counted the money there\r\nstill was lying the packet of twenty five thousand florins.", "I handed it\r\nto her.", "“The francs are mine, then, are they?", "They are mine?” she inquired\r\nviciously as she balanced the money in her hands.", "“Yes; they have _always_ been yours,” I said.", "“Then _take_ your fifty thousand francs!” and she hurled them full in\r\nmy face.", "The packet burst as she did so, and the floor became strewed\r\nwith bank-notes.", "The instant that the deed was done she rushed from the\r\nroom.", "At that moment she cannot have been in her right mind; yet, what was\r\nthe cause of her temporary aberration I cannot say.", "For a month past\r\nshe had been unwell.", "Yet what had brought about this _present_\r\ncondition of mind, above all things, this outburst?", "Had it come of\r\nwounded pride?", "Had it come of despair over her decision to come to me?", "Had it come of the fact that, presuming too much on my good fortune, I\r\nhad seemed to be intending to desert her (even as De Griers had done)\r\nwhen once I had given her the fifty thousand francs?", "But, on my honour,\r\nI had never cherished any such intention.", "What was at fault, I think,\r\nwas her own pride, which kept urging her not to trust me, but, rather,\r\nto insult me—even though she had not realised the fact.", "In her eyes I\r\ncorresponded to De Griers, and therefore had been condemned for a fault\r\nnot wholly my own.", "Her mood of late had been a sort of delirium, a sort\r\nof light-headedness—that I knew full well; yet, never had I\r\nsufficiently taken it into consideration.", "Perhaps she would not pardon\r\nme now?", "Ah, but this was _the present_.", "What about the future?"], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_72", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 72)", "language": "de", "content": "Her\r\ndelirium and sickness were not likely to make her forget what she had\r\ndone in bringing me De Griers’ letter. No, she must have known what she\r\nwas doing when she brought it. Somehow I contrived to stuff the pile of notes and gold under the bed,\r\nto cover them over, and then to leave the room some ten minutes after\r\nPolina. I felt sure that she had returned to her own room; wherefore, I\r\nintended quietly to follow her, and to ask the nursemaid aid who opened\r\nthe door how her mistress was. Judge, therefore, of my surprise when,\r\nmeeting the domestic on the stairs, she informed me that Polina had not\r\nyet returned, and that she (the domestic) was at that moment on her way\r\nto my room in quest of her! “Mlle. left me but ten minutes ago,” I said. “What can have become of\r\nher?” The nursemaid looked at me reproachfully. Already sundry rumours were flying about the hotel. Both in the office\r\nof the commissionaire and in that of the landlord it was whispered\r\nthat, at seven o’clock that morning, the Fräulein had left the hotel,\r\nand set off, despite the rain, in the direction of the Hôtel\r\nd’Angleterre. From words and hints let fall I could see that the fact\r\nof Polina having spent the night in my room was now public property. Also, sundry rumours were circulating concerning the General’s family\r\naffairs. It was known that last night he had gone out of his mind, and\r\nparaded the hotel in tears; also, that the old lady who had arrived was\r\nhis mother, and that she had come from Russia on purpose to forbid her\r\nson’s marriage with Mlle. de Cominges, as well as to cut him out of her\r\nwill if he should disobey her; also that, because he had disobeyed her,\r\nshe had squandered all her money at roulette, in order to have nothing\r\nmore to leave to him. “Oh, these Russians!” exclaimed the landlord,\r\nwith an angry toss of the head, while the bystanders laughed and the\r\nclerk betook himself to his accounts. Also, every one had learnt about\r\nmy winnings; Karl, the corridor lacquey, was the first to congratulate\r\nme. But with these folk I had nothing to do. My business was to set off\r\nat full speed to the Hôtel d’Angleterre. As yet it was early for Mr. Astley to receive visitors; but, as soon as\r\nhe learnt that it was _I_ who had arrived, he came out into the\r\ncorridor to meet me, and stood looking at me in silence with his\r\nsteel-grey eyes as he waited to hear what I had to say. I inquired\r\nafter Polina. “She is ill,” he replied, still looking at me with his direct,\r\nunwavering glance. “And she is in your rooms.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she is in my rooms.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are minded to keep her there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am minded to keep her there.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Astley, that will raise a scandal. It ought not to be\r\nallowed. Besides, she is very ill. Perhaps you had not remarked that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have. It was I who told you about it. Had she not been ill, she\r\nwould not have gone and spent the night with you.”\r\n\r\n“Then you know all about it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a\r\nrelative of mine. Unfortunately, being ill, she made a mistake, and\r\nwent to your rooms instead.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? Then I wish you joy, Mr. Astley. Apropos, you have reminded me\r\nof something. Were you beneath my window last night? Every moment Mlle. Polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there;\r\nafter which she always smiled.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?

Yes, that is what he intends\r\nto do.” Now, although I was honestly sorry for Polina, it is a fact\r\nthat, from the moment when, the previous night, I had approached the\r\ngaming-table, and begun to rake in the packets of bank-notes, my love\r\nfor her had entered upon a new plane. Yes, I can say that now;\r\nalthough, at the time, I was barely conscious of it. Was I, then, at\r\nheart a gambler? Did I, after all, love Polina not so _very_ much? No,\r\nno! As God is my witness, I loved her! Even when I was returning home\r\nfrom Mr. Astley’s my suffering was genuine, and my self-reproach\r\nsincere. But presently I was to go through an exceedingly strange and\r\nugly experience. I was proceeding to the General’s rooms when I heard a door near me\r\nopen, and a voice call me by name. It was Mlle.’s mother, the Widow de\r\nCominges who was inviting me, in her daughter’s name, to enter. I did so; whereupon, I heard a laugh and a little cry proceed from the\r\nbedroom (the pair occupied a suite of two apartments), where Mlle. Blanche was just arising. “Ah, c’est lui! Viens, donc, bête! Is it true that you have won a\r\nmountain of gold and silver? J’aimerais mieux l’or.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied with a smile. “How much?”\r\n\r\n“A hundred thousand florins.”\r\n\r\n“Bibi, comme tu es bête! Come in here, for I can’t hear you where you\r\nare now. Nous ferons bombance, n’est-ce pas?”\r\n\r\nEntering her room, I found her lolling under a pink satin coverlet, and\r\nrevealing a pair of swarthy, wonderfully healthy shoulders—shoulders\r\nsuch as one sees in dreams—shoulders covered over with a white cambric\r\nnightgown which, trimmed with lace, stood out, in striking relief,\r\nagainst the darkness of her skin. “Mon fils, as-tu du cœur?” she cried when she saw me, and then giggled. Her laugh had always been a very cheerful one, and at times it even\r\nsounded sincere. “Tout autre—” I began, paraphrasing Corneille. “See here,” she prattled on. “Please search for my stockings, and help\r\nme to dress. Aussi, si tu n’es pas trop bête je te prends à Paris. I am\r\njust off, let me tell you.”\r\n\r\n“This moment?”\r\n\r\n“In half an hour.”\r\n\r\nTrue enough, everything stood ready-packed—trunks, portmanteaux, and\r\nall. Coffee had long been served. “Eh bien, tu verras Paris. Dis donc, qu’est-ce que c’est qu’un\r\n‘utchitel’? Tu étais bien bête quand tu étais ‘utchitel.’ Where are my\r\nstockings? Please help me to dress.”\r\n\r\nAnd she lifted up a really ravishing foot—small, swarthy, and not\r\nmisshapen like the majority of feet which look dainty only in bottines. I laughed, and started to draw on to the foot a silk stocking, while\r\nMlle. Blanche sat on the edge of the bed and chattered. “Eh bien, que feras-tu si je te prends avec moi?

You are not worth it.—Ah, que fais-tu?”\r\n\r\nFor, while drawing on the other stocking, I had felt constrained to\r\nkiss her. Immediately she shrunk back, kicked me in the face with her\r\ntoes, and turned me neck and crop out of the room. “Eh bien, mon ‘utchitel’,” she called after me, “je t’attends, si tu\r\nveux. I start in a quarter of an hour’s time.”\r\n\r\nI returned to my own room with my head in a whirl. It was not my fault\r\nthat Polina had thrown a packet in my face, and preferred Mr. Astley to\r\nmyself. A few bank-notes were still fluttering about the floor, and I\r\npicked them up. At that moment the door opened, and the landlord\r\nappeared—a person who, until now, had never bestowed upon me so much as\r\na glance. He had come to know if I would prefer to move to a lower\r\nfloor—to a suite which had just been tenanted by Count V. For a moment I reflected. “No!” I shouted. “My account, please, for in ten minutes I shall be\r\ngone.”\r\n\r\n“To Paris, to Paris!” I added to myself. “Every man of birth must make\r\nher acquaintance.”\r\n\r\nWithin a quarter of an hour all three of us were seated in a family\r\ncompartment—Mlle. Blanche, the Widow de Cominges, and myself. Mlle. kept laughing hysterically as she looked at me, and Madame re-echoed\r\nher; but _I_ did not feel so cheerful. My life had broken in two, and\r\nyesterday had infected me with a habit of staking my all upon a card. Although it might be that I had failed to win my stake, that I had lost\r\nmy senses, that I desired nothing better, I felt that the scene was to\r\nbe changed only _for a time_. “Within a month from now,” I kept\r\nthinking to myself, “I shall be back again in Roulettenberg; and _then_\r\nI mean to have it out with you, Mr. Astley!” Yes, as now I look back at\r\nthings, I remember that I felt greatly depressed, despite the absurd\r\ngigglings of the egregious Blanche. “What is the matter with you? How dull you are!” she cried at length as\r\nshe interrupted her laughter to take me seriously to task. “Come, come! We are going to spend your two hundred thousand francs for\r\nyou, et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi. I myself will tie your tie\r\nfor you, and introduce you to Hortense. And when we have spent your\r\nmoney you shall return here, and break the bank again. What did those\r\ntwo Jews tell you?—that the thing most needed is daring, and that you\r\npossess it? Consequently, this is not the first time that you will be\r\nhurrying to Paris with money in your pocket. Quant à moi, je veux\r\ncinquante mille francs de rente, et alors——”\r\n\r\n“But what about the General?” I interrupted. “The General? You know well enough that at about this hour every day he\r\ngoes to buy me a bouquet. On this occasion, I took care to tell him\r\nthat he must hunt for the choicest of flowers; and when he returns\r\nhome, the poor fellow will find the bird flown. Possibly he may take\r\nwing in pursuit—ha, ha, ha! And if so, I shall not be sorry, for he\r\ncould be useful to me in Paris, and Mr. Astley will pay his debts\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nIn this manner did I depart for the Gay City.

I spent a little over three weeks there, and, during that\r\ntime, saw my hundred thousand francs come to an end. I speak only of\r\nthe _one_ hundred thousand francs, for the other hundred thousand I\r\ngave to Mlle. Blanche in pure cash. That is to say, I handed her fifty\r\nthousand francs at Frankfurt, and, three days later (in Paris),\r\nadvanced her another fifty thousand on note of hand. Nevertheless, a\r\nweek had not elapsed ere she came to me for more money. “Et les cent\r\nmille francs qui nous restent,” she added, “tu les mangeras avec moi,\r\nmon utchitel.” Yes, she always called me her “utchitel.” A person more\r\neconomical, grasping, and mean than Mlle. Blanche one could not\r\nimagine. But this was only as regards _her own_ money. _My_ hundred\r\nthousand francs (as she explained to me later) she needed to set up her\r\nestablishment in Paris, “so that once and for all I may be on a decent\r\nfooting, and proof against any stones which may be thrown at me—at all\r\nevents for a long time to come.” Nevertheless, I saw nothing of those\r\nhundred thousand francs, for my own purse (which she inspected daily)\r\nnever managed to amass in it more than a hundred francs at a time; and,\r\ngenerally the sum did not reach even that figure. “What do _you_ want with money?” she would say to me with air of\r\nabsolute simplicity; and I never disputed the point. Nevertheless,\r\nthough she fitted out her flat very badly with the money, the fact did\r\nnot prevent her from saying when, later, she was showing me over the\r\nrooms of her new abode: “See what care and taste can do with the most\r\nwretched of means!” However, her “wretchedness” had cost fifty thousand\r\nfrancs, while with the remaining fifty thousand she purchased a\r\ncarriage and horses. Also, we gave a couple of balls—evening parties attended by Hortense\r\nand Lisette and Cléopatre, who were women remarkable both for the\r\nnumber of their liaisons and (though only in some cases) for their good\r\nlooks. At these reunions I had to play the part of host—to meet and\r\nentertain fat mercantile parvenus who were impossible by reason of\r\ntheir rudeness and braggadocio, colonels of various kinds, hungry\r\nauthors, and journalistic hacks—all of whom disported themselves in\r\nfashionable tailcoats and pale yellow gloves, and displayed such an\r\naggregate of conceit and gasconade as would be unthinkable even in St. Petersburg—which is saying a great deal! They used to try to make fun\r\nof me, but I would console myself by drinking champagne and then\r\nlolling in a retiring-room. Nevertheless, I found it deadly work. “C’est un utchitel,” Blanche would say of me, “qui a gagné deux cent\r\nmille francs, and but for me, would have had not a notion how to spend\r\nthem. Presently he will have to return to his tutoring. Does any one\r\nknow of a vacant post? You know, one must do something for him.”\r\n\r\nI had the more frequent recourse to champagne in that I constantly felt\r\ndepressed and bored, owing to the fact that I was living in the most\r\nbourgeois commercial milieu imaginable—a milieu wherein every sou was\r\ncounted and grudged. Indeed, two weeks had not elapsed before I\r\nperceived that Blanche had no real affection for me, even though she\r\ndressed me in elegant clothes, and herself tied my tie each day. In\r\nshort, she utterly despised me. But that caused me no concern.

But I need not enlarge further, for to do so would require a story to\r\nitself, and entail a colouring which I am loth to impart to the present\r\nnarrative. The point is that with all my faculties I desired the\r\nepisode to come to an end as speedily as possible. Unfortunately, our\r\nhundred thousand francs lasted us, as I have said, for very nearly a\r\nmonth—which greatly surprised me. At all events, Blanche bought herself\r\narticles to the tune of eighty thousand francs, and the rest sufficed\r\njust to meet our expenses of living. Towards the close of the affair,\r\nBlanche grew almost frank with me (at least, she scarcely lied to me at\r\nall)—declaring, amongst other things, that none of the debts which she\r\nhad been obliged to incur were going to fall upon my head. “I have\r\npurposely refrained from making you responsible for my bills or\r\nborrowings,” she said, “for the reason that I am sorry for you.

Think, too, what this accursed marriage with the General is going to\r\ncost me!”\r\n\r\nTrue enough, the marriage took place. It did so at the close of our\r\nmonth together, and I am bound to suppose that it was upon the ceremony\r\nthat the last remnants of my money were spent. With it the episode—that\r\nis to say, my sojourn with the Frenchwoman—came to an end, and I\r\nformally retired from the scene. It happened thus: A week after we had taken up our abode in Paris there\r\narrived thither the General. He came straight to see us, and\r\nthenceforward lived with us practically as our guest, though he had a\r\nflat of his own as well. Blanche met him with merry badinage and\r\nlaughter, and even threw her arms around him. In fact, she managed it\r\nso that he had to follow everywhere in her train—whether when\r\npromenading on the Boulevards, or when driving, or when going to the\r\ntheatre, or when paying calls; and this use which she made of him quite\r\nsatisfied the General. Still of imposing appearance and presence, as\r\nwell as of fair height, he had a dyed moustache and whiskers (he had\r\nformerly been in the cuirassiers), and a handsome, though a somewhat\r\nwrinkled, face. Also, his manners were excellent, and he could carry a\r\nfrockcoat well—the more so since, in Paris, he took to wearing his\r\norders. To promenade the Boulevards with such a man was not only a\r\nthing possible, but also, so to speak, a thing advisable, and with this\r\nprogramme the good but foolish General had not a fault to find. The\r\ntruth is that he had never counted upon this programme when he came to\r\nParis to seek us out. On that occasion he had made his appearance\r\nnearly shaking with terror, for he had supposed that Blanche would at\r\nonce raise an outcry, and have him put from the door; wherefore, he was\r\nthe more enraptured at the turn that things had taken, and spent the\r\nmonth in a state of senseless ecstasy. Already I had learnt that, after\r\nour unexpected departure from Roulettenberg, he had had a sort of a\r\nfit—that he had fallen into a swoon, and spent a week in a species of\r\ngarrulous delirium. Doctors had been summoned to him, but he had broken\r\naway from them, and suddenly taken a train to Paris. Of course\r\nBlanche’s reception of him had acted as the best of all possible cures,\r\nbut for long enough he carried the marks of his affliction, despite his\r\npresent condition of rapture and delight. To think clearly, or even to\r\nengage in any serious conversation, had now become impossible for him;\r\nhe could only ejaculate after each word “Hm!” and then nod his head in\r\nconfirmation. Sometimes, also, he would laugh, but only in a nervous,\r\nhysterical sort of a fashion; while at other times he would sit for\r\nhours looking as black as night, with his heavy eyebrows knitted.", "sentences": ["Moreover, she introduced me to Hortense,\r\nwho was a remarkable woman in her way, and known among us as Thérèse\r\nPhilosophe.", "But I need not enlarge further, for to do so would require a story to\r\nitself, and entail a colouring which I am loth to impart to the present\r\nnarrative.", "The point is that with all my faculties I desired the\r\nepisode to come to an end as speedily as possible.", "Unfortunately, our\r\nhundred thousand francs lasted us, as I have said, for very nearly a\r\nmonth—which greatly surprised me.", "At all events, Blanche bought herself\r\narticles to the tune of eighty thousand francs, and the rest sufficed\r\njust to meet our expenses of living.", "Towards the close of the affair,\r\nBlanche grew almost frank with me (at least, she scarcely lied to me at\r\nall)—declaring, amongst other things, that none of the debts which she\r\nhad been obliged to incur were going to fall upon my head.", "“I have\r\npurposely refrained from making you responsible for my bills or\r\nborrowings,” she said, “for the reason that I am sorry for you.", "Any\r\nother woman in my place would have done so, and have let you go to\r\nprison.", "See, then, how much I love you, and how good-hearted I am!", "Think, too, what this accursed marriage with the General is going to\r\ncost me!”\r\n\r\nTrue enough, the marriage took place.", "It did so at the close of our\r\nmonth together, and I am bound to suppose that it was upon the ceremony\r\nthat the last remnants of my money were spent.", "With it the episode—that\r\nis to say, my sojourn with the Frenchwoman—came to an end, and I\r\nformally retired from the scene.", "It happened thus: A week after we had taken up our abode in Paris there\r\narrived thither the General.", "He came straight to see us, and\r\nthenceforward lived with us practically as our guest, though he had a\r\nflat of his own as well.", "Blanche met him with merry badinage and\r\nlaughter, and even threw her arms around him.", "In fact, she managed it\r\nso that he had to follow everywhere in her train—whether when\r\npromenading on the Boulevards, or when driving, or when going to the\r\ntheatre, or when paying calls; and this use which she made of him quite\r\nsatisfied the General.", "Still of imposing appearance and presence, as\r\nwell as of fair height, he had a dyed moustache and whiskers (he had\r\nformerly been in the cuirassiers), and a handsome, though a somewhat\r\nwrinkled, face.", "Also, his manners were excellent, and he could carry a\r\nfrockcoat well—the more so since, in Paris, he took to wearing his\r\norders.", "To promenade the Boulevards with such a man was not only a\r\nthing possible, but also, so to speak, a thing advisable, and with this\r\nprogramme the good but foolish General had not a fault to find.", "The\r\ntruth is that he had never counted upon this programme when he came to\r\nParis to seek us out.", "On that occasion he had made his appearance\r\nnearly shaking with terror, for he had supposed that Blanche would at\r\nonce raise an outcry, and have him put from the door; wherefore, he was\r\nthe more enraptured at the turn that things had taken, and spent the\r\nmonth in a state of senseless ecstasy.", "Already I had learnt that, after\r\nour unexpected departure from Roulettenberg, he had had a sort of a\r\nfit—that he had fallen into a swoon, and spent a week in a species of\r\ngarrulous delirium.", "Doctors had been summoned to him, but he had broken\r\naway from them, and suddenly taken a train to Paris.", "Of course\r\nBlanche’s reception of him had acted as the best of all possible cures,\r\nbut for long enough he carried the marks of his affliction, despite his\r\npresent condition of rapture and delight.", "To think clearly, or even to\r\nengage in any serious conversation, had now become impossible for him;\r\nhe could only ejaculate after each word “Hm!” and then nod his head in\r\nconfirmation.", "Sometimes, also, he would laugh, but only in a nervous,\r\nhysterical sort of a fashion; while at other times he would sit for\r\nhours looking as black as night, with his heavy eyebrows knitted."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "beginner", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "txt_de_2197_78", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Gambler (Part 78)", "language": "de", "content": "Of\r\nmuch that went on he remained wholly oblivious, for he grew extremely\r\nabsent-minded, and took to talking to himself. Only Blanche could awake\r\nhim to any semblance of life. His fits of depression and moodiness in\r\ncorners always meant either that he had not seen her for some while, or\r\nthat she had gone out without taking him with her, or that she had\r\nomitted to caress him before departing. When in this condition, he\r\nwould refuse to say what he wanted—nor had he the least idea that he\r\nwas thus sulking and moping. Next, after remaining in this condition\r\nfor an hour or two (this I remarked on two occasions when Blanche had\r\ngone out for the day—probably to see Albert), he would begin to look\r\nabout him, and to grow uneasy, and to hurry about with an air as though\r\nhe had suddenly remembered something, and must try and find it; after\r\nwhich, not perceiving the object of his search, nor succeeding in\r\nrecalling what that object had been, he would as suddenly relapse into\r\noblivion, and continue so until the reappearance of Blanche—merry,\r\nwanton, half-dressed, and laughing her strident laugh as she approached\r\nto pet him, and even to kiss him (though the latter reward he seldom\r\nreceived). Once, he was so overjoyed at her doing so that he burst into\r\ntears. Even I myself was surprised. From the first moment of his arrival in Paris, Blanche set herself to\r\nplead with me on his behalf; and at such times she even rose to heights\r\nof eloquence—saying that it was for _me_ she had abandoned him, though\r\nshe had almost become his betrothed and promised to become so; that it\r\nwas for _her_ sake he had deserted his family; that, having been in his\r\nservice, I ought to remember the fact, and to feel ashamed. To all this\r\nI would say nothing, however much she chattered on; until at length I\r\nwould burst out laughing, and the incident would come to an end (at\r\nfirst, as I have said, she had thought me a fool, but since she had\r\ncome to deem me a man of sense and sensibility). In short, I had the\r\nhappiness of calling her better nature into play; for though, at first,\r\nI had not deemed her so, she was, in reality, a kind-hearted woman\r\nafter her own fashion. “You are good and clever,” she said to me\r\ntowards the finish, “and my one regret is that you are also so\r\nwrong-headed. You will _her_ be a rich man!”\r\n\r\n“Un vrai Russe—un Kalmuk” she usually called me. Several times she sent me to give the General an airing in the streets,\r\neven as she might have done with a lacquey and her spaniel; but, I\r\npreferred to take him to the theatre, to the Bal Mabille, and to\r\nrestaurants. For this purpose she usually allowed me some money, though\r\nthe General had a little of his own, and enjoyed taking out his purse\r\nbefore strangers. Once I had to use actual force to prevent him from\r\nbuying a phaeton at a price of seven hundred francs, after a vehicle\r\nhad caught his fancy in the Palais Royal as seeming to be a desirable\r\npresent for Blanche. What could _she_ have done with a\r\nseven-hundred-franc phaeton?—and the General possessed in the world but\r\na thousand francs! The origin even of those francs I could never\r\ndetermine, but imagined them to have emanated from Mr. Astley—the more\r\nso since the latter had paid the family’s hotel bill. As for what view\r\nthe General took of myself, I think that he never divined the footing\r\non which I stood with Blanche. True, he had heard, in a dim sort of\r\nway, that I had won a good deal of money; but more probably he supposed\r\nme to be acting as secretary—or even as a kind of servant—to his\r\ninamorata. At all events, he continued to address me, in his old\r\nhaughty style, as my superior. At times he even took it upon himself to\r\nscold me.

Blanche du Placet! Mlle. Blanche du Placet, du Placet!” He beamed with satisfaction as he did\r\nso. Both in the church and at the wedding breakfast he remained not\r\nonly pleased and contented, but even proud. She too underwent a change,\r\nfor now she assumed an air of added dignity. “I must behave altogether differently,” she confided to me with a\r\nserious air. “Yet, mark you, there is a tiresome circumstance of which\r\nI had never before thought—which is, how best to pronounce my new\r\nfamily name.

The _last_ of them would be the best to use, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\nAt length the time had come for us to part, and Blanche, the egregious\r\nBlanche, shed real tears as she took her leave of me. “Tu étais bon\r\nenfant” she said with a sob. “Je te croyais bête et tu en avais l’air,\r\nbut it suited you.” Then, having given me a final handshake, she\r\nexclaimed, “Attends!”; whereafter, running into her boudoir, she\r\nbrought me thence two thousand-franc notes. I could scarcely believe my\r\neyes! “They may come in handy for you,” she explained, “for, though you\r\nare a very learned tutor, you are a very stupid man. More than two\r\nthousand francs, however, I am not going to give you, for the reason\r\nthat, if I did so, you would gamble them all away. Now good-bye. Nous\r\nserons toujours bons amis, and if you win again, do not fail to come to\r\nme, et tu seras heureux.”\r\n\r\nI myself had still five hundred francs left, as well as a watch worth a\r\nthousand francs, a few diamond studs, and so on. Consequently, I could\r\nsubsist for quite a length of time without particularly bestirring\r\nmyself. Purposely I have taken up my abode where I am now partly to\r\npull myself together, and partly to wait for Mr. Astley, who, I have\r\nlearnt, will soon be here for a day or so on business. Yes, I know\r\nthat, and then—and then I shall go to Homburg. But to Roulettenberg I\r\nshall not go until next year, for they say it is bad to try one’s luck\r\ntwice in succession at a table. Moreover, Homburg is where the best\r\nplay is carried on. XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a year and eight months since I last looked at these notes of\r\nmine. I do so now only because, being overwhelmed with depression, I\r\nwish to distract my mind by reading them through at random. I left them\r\noff at the point where I was just going to Homburg. My God, with what a\r\nlight heart (comparatively speaking) did I write the concluding\r\nlines!—though it may be not so much with a light heart, as with a\r\nmeasure of self-confidence and unquenchable hope. At that time had I\r\nany doubts of myself? Yet behold me now. Scarcely a year and a half\r\nhave passed, yet I am in a worse position than the meanest beggar. But\r\nwhat is a beggar? A fig for beggary! I have ruined myself—that is all. Nor is there anything with which I can compare myself; there is no\r\nmoral which it would be of any use for you to read to me.

Oh,\r\nyou self-satisfied persons who, in your unctuous pride, are forever\r\nready to mouth your maxims—if only you knew how fully I myself\r\ncomprehend the sordidness of my present state, you would not trouble to\r\nwag your tongues at me!

It lies in the fact that by a\r\nsingle turn of a roulette wheel everything for me, has become changed. Yet, had things befallen otherwise, these moralists would have been\r\namong the first (yes, I feel persuaded of it) to approach me with\r\nfriendly jests and congratulations. Yes, they would never have turned\r\nfrom me as they are doing now! A fig for all of them! What am I? I am\r\nzero—nothing. What shall I be tomorrow? I may be risen from the dead,\r\nand have begun life anew. For still, I may discover the man in myself,\r\nif only my manhood has not become utterly shattered. I went, I say, to Homburg, but afterwards went also to Roulettenberg,\r\nas well as to Spa and Baden; in which latter place, for a time, I acted\r\nas valet to a certain rascal of a Privy Councillor, by name Heintze,\r\nwho until lately was also my master here. Yes, for five months I lived\r\nmy life with lacqueys! That was just after I had come out of\r\nRoulettenberg prison, where I had lain for a small debt which I owed. Out of that prison I was bailed by—by whom? By Mr. Astley? By Polina? I\r\ndo not know. At all events, the debt was paid to the tune of two\r\nhundred thalers, and I sallied forth a free man. But what was I to do\r\nwith myself? In my dilemma I had recourse to this Heintze, who was a\r\nyoung scapegrace, and the sort of man who could speak and write three\r\nlanguages. At first I acted as his secretary, at a salary of thirty\r\ngülden a month, but afterwards I became his lacquey, for the reason\r\nthat he could not afford to keep a secretary—only an unpaid servant. I\r\nhad nothing else to turn to, so I remained with him, and allowed myself\r\nto become his flunkey. But by stinting myself in meat and drink I\r\nsaved, during my five months of service, some seventy gülden; and one\r\nevening, when we were at Baden, I told him that I wished to resign my\r\npost, and then hastened to betake myself to roulette. Oh, how my heart beat as I did so! No, it was not the money that I\r\nvalued—what I wanted was to make all this mob of Heintzes, hotel\r\nproprietors, and fine ladies of Baden talk about me, recount my story,\r\nwonder at me, extol my doings, and worship my winnings. True, these\r\nwere childish fancies and aspirations, but who knows but that I might\r\nmeet Polina, and be able to tell her everything, and see her look of\r\nsurprise at the fact that I had overcome so many adverse strokes of\r\nfortune. No, I had no desire for money for its own sake, for I was\r\nperfectly well aware that I should only squander it upon some new\r\nBlanche, and spend another three weeks in Paris after buying a pair of\r\nhorses which had cost sixteen thousand francs. No, I never believed\r\nmyself to be a hoarder; in fact, I knew only too well that I was a\r\nspendthrift. And already, with a sort of fear, a sort of sinking in my\r\nheart, I could hear the cries of the croupiers—“Trente et un, rouge,\r\nimpair et passe,” “Quarte, noir, pair et manque.” How greedily I gazed\r\nupon the gaming-table, with its scattered louis d’or, ten-gülden\r\npieces, and thalers; upon the streams of gold as they issued from the\r\ncroupier’s hands, and piled themselves up into heaps of gold\r\nscintillating as fire; upon the ell—long rolls of silver lying around\r\nthe croupier. Even at a distance of two rooms I could hear the chink of\r\nthat money—so much so that I nearly fell into convulsions. Ah, the evening when I took those seventy gülden to the gaming table\r\nwas a memorable one for me. I began by staking ten gülden upon passe. For passe I had always had a sort of predilection, yet I lost my stake\r\nupon it. This left me with sixty gülden in silver.

Ah, at such moments one forgets both oneself\r\nand one’s former failures! This I had gained by risking my very life. I\r\nhad dared so to risk, and behold, again I was a member of mankind! I went and hired a room, I shut myself up in it, and sat counting my\r\nmoney until three o’clock in the morning. To think that when I awoke on\r\nthe morrow, I was no lacquey! I decided to leave at once for Homburg. There I should neither have to serve as a footman nor to lie in prison. Half an hour before starting, I went and ventured a couple of stakes—no\r\nmore; with the result that, in all, I lost fifteen hundred florins. Nevertheless, I proceeded to Homburg, and have now been there for a\r\nmonth. Of course, I am living in constant trepidation, playing for the\r\nsmallest of stakes, and always looking out for something—calculating,\r\nstanding whole days by the gaming-tables to watch the play—even seeing\r\nthat play in my dreams—yet seeming, the while, to be in some way\r\nstiffening, to be growing caked, as it were, in mire.

I had not seen him since we parted at\r\nRoulettenberg, and now we met quite by accident. At the time I was\r\nwalking in the public gardens, and meditating upon the fact that not\r\nonly had I still some fifty gülden in my possession, but also I had\r\nfully paid up my hotel bill three days ago. Consequently, I was in a\r\nposition to try my luck again at roulette; and if I won anything I\r\nshould be able to continue my play, whereas, if I lost what I now\r\npossessed, I should once more have to accept a lacquey’s place,\r\nprovided that, in the alternative, I failed to discover a Russian\r\nfamily which stood in need of a tutor. Plunged in these reflections, I\r\nstarted on my daily walk through the Park and forest towards a\r\nneighbouring principality. Sometimes, on such occasions, I spent four\r\nhours on the way, and would return to Homburg tired and hungry; but, on\r\nthis particular occasion, I had scarcely left the gardens for the Park\r\nwhen I caught sight of Astley seated on a bench. As soon as he\r\nperceived me, he called me by name, and I went and sat down beside him;\r\nbut, on noticing that he seemed a little stiff in his manner, I\r\nhastened to moderate the expression of joy which the sight of him had\r\ncalled forth. “_You_ here?” he said. “Well, I had an idea that I should meet you. Do\r\nnot trouble to tell me anything, for I know all—yes, all. In fact, your\r\nwhole life during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“How closely you watch the doings of your old friends!” I replied. “That does you infinite credit. But stop a moment. You have reminded me\r\nof something. Was it you who bailed me out of Roulettenberg prison when\r\nI was lying there for a debt of two hundred gülden? _someone_ did so.”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear no!—though I knew all the time that you were lying there.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you could tell me who _did_ bail me out?”\r\n\r\n“No; I am afraid I could not.”\r\n\r\n“What a strange thing! For I know no Russians at all here, so it cannot\r\nhave been a Russian who befriended me. In Russia we Orthodox folk _do_\r\ngo bail for one another, but in this case I thought it must have been\r\ndone by some English stranger who was not conversant with the ways of\r\nthe country.”\r\n\r\nMr. Astley seemed to listen to me with a sort of surprise.

Astley was not quick to understand this, but presently did so and\r\nlaughed. “Your remarks please me as they always did,” he continued. “In those\r\nwords I see the clever, triumphant, and, above all things, cynical\r\nfriend of former days.

At that time it was ages since I had\r\nlast looked at a paper or turned the pages of a book. “You are growing blasé,” he said. “You have not only renounced life,\r\nwith its interests and social ties, but the duties of a citizen and a\r\nman; you have not only renounced the friends whom I know you to have\r\nhad, and every aim in life but that of winning money; but you have also\r\nrenounced your memory.

Only for a time have I put them out of my head. Only\r\nuntil I shall have rehabilitated myself, am I keeping my memory dulled. When that hour shall come, you will see me arise from the dead.”\r\n\r\n“Then you will have to be here another ten years,” he replied. “Should\r\nI then be alive, I will remind you—here, on this very bench—of what I\r\nhave just said. In fact, I will bet you a wager that I shall do so.”\r\n\r\n“Say no more,” I interrupted impatiently. “And to show you that I have\r\nnot wholly forgotten the past, may I enquire where Mlle.

That, I think, concludes all that I have to\r\ntell.”\r\n\r\n“And De Griers? Is he too travelling in Switzerland?”\r\n\r\n“No; nor do I know where he is.

In spite of our old friendship?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in spite of our old friendship.”\r\n\r\n“Then I beg your pardon a thousand times, Mr. Astley. I meant nothing\r\noffensive to Mlle. Polina, for I have nothing of which to accuse her. Moreover, the question of there being anything between this Frenchman\r\nand this Russian lady is not one which you and I need discuss, nor even\r\nattempt to understand.”\r\n\r\n“If,” replied Astley, “you do not care to hear their names coupled\r\ntogether, may I ask you what you mean by the expressions ‘this\r\nFrenchman,’ ‘this Russian lady,’ and ‘there being anything between\r\nthem’? Why do you call them so particularly a ‘Frenchman’ and a\r\n‘Russian lady’?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see you are interested, Mr. Astley. But it is a long, long\r\nstory, and calls for a lengthy preface. At the same time, the question\r\nis an important one, however ridiculous it may seem at the first\r\nglance. A Frenchman, Mr. Astley, is merely a fine figure of a man. With\r\nthis you, as a Britisher, may not agree. With it I also, as a Russian,\r\nmay not agree—out of envy. Yet possibly our good ladies are of another\r\nopinion. For instance, one may look upon Racine as a broken-down,\r\nhobbledehoy, perfumed individual—one may even be unable to read him;\r\nand I too may think him the same, as well as, in some respects, a\r\nsubject for ridicule. Yet about him, Mr. Astley, there is a certain\r\ncharm, and, above all things, he is a great poet—though one might like\r\nto deny it. Yes, the Frenchman, the Parisian, as a national figure, was\r\nin process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians\r\nhad even ceased to be bears. The Revolution bequeathed to the French\r\nnobility its heritage, and now every whipper-snapper of a Parisian may\r\npossess manners, methods of expression, and even thoughts that are\r\nabove reproach in form, while all the time he himself may share in that\r\nform neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul—his manners,\r\nand the rest, having come to him through inheritance. Yes, taken by\r\nhimself, the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of\r\nvillains. Per contra, there is no one in the world more worthy of\r\nconfidence and respect than this young Russian lady. De Griers might so\r\nmask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart, for he\r\nhas an imposing figure, Mr. Astley, and this young lady might easily\r\ntake that figure for his real self—for the natural form of his heart\r\nand soul—instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him. And even though it may offend you, I feel bound to say that the\r\nmajority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined, whereas we\r\nRussian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it, and are always\r\neager to cultivate the same.

THE WIT AND HUMOR OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARRIAGE OF SIR JOHN SMITH\r\n\r\nBY PHOEBE CARY\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not a sigh was heard, nor a funeral tone,\r\n      As the man to his bridal we hurried;\r\n    Not a woman discharged her farewell groan,\r\n      On the spot where the fellow was married. We married him just about eight at night,\r\n      Our faces paler turning,\r\n    By the struggling moonbeam's misty light,\r\n      And the gas-lamp's steady burning. No useless watch-chain covered his vest,\r\n      Nor over-dressed we found him;\r\n    But he looked like a gentleman wearing his best,\r\n      With a few of his friends around him. Few and short were the things we said,\r\n      And we spoke not a word of sorrow,\r\n    But we silently gazed on the man that was wed,\r\n      And we bitterly thought of the morrow. We thought, as we silently stood about,\r\n      With spite and anger dying,\r\n    How the merest stranger had cut us out,\r\n      With only half our trying. Lightly we'll talk of the fellow that's gone,\r\n      And oft for the past upbraid him;\r\n    But little he'll reck if we let him live on,\r\n      In the house where his wife conveyed him. But our hearty task at length was done,\r\n      When the clock struck the hour for retiring;\r\n    And we heard the spiteful squib and pun\r\n      The girls were sullenly firing. Slowly and sadly we turned to go,--\r\n      We had struggled, and we were human;\r\n    We shed not a tear, and we spoke not our woe,\r\n      But we left him alone with his woman. THE SPRING BEAUTIES\r\n\r\nBY HELEN AVERY CONE\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Puritan Spring Beauties stood freshly clad for church;\r\n    A thrush, white-breasted, o'er them sat singing on his perch. \"Happy be! for fair are ye!\" the gentle singer told them;\r\n    But presently a buff-coat Bee came booming up to scold them. \"Vanity, oh, vanity! Young maids, beware of vanity!\"\r\n          Grumbled out the buff-coat Bee,\r\n          Half parson-like, half soldierly. The sweet-faced maidens trembled, with pretty, pinky blushes,\r\n    Convinced that it was wicked to listen to the thrushes;\r\n    And when that shady afternoon, I chanced that way to pass,\r\n    They hung their little bonnets down and looked into the grass. All because the buff-coat Bee\r\n          Lectured them so solemnly--\r\n          \"Vanity, oh, vanity! Young maids, beware of vanity!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOING UP AND COMING DOWN\r\n\r\nBY MARY F.

THE SET OF CHINA\r\n\r\nBY ELIZA LESLIE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gummage,\" said Mrs. Atmore, as she entered a certain\r\ndrawing-school, at that time the most fashionable in Philadelphia, \"I\r\nhave brought you a new pupil, my daughter, Miss Marianne Atmore. Have\r\nyou a vacancy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I can't say that I have,\" replied Mr. Gummage; \"I never have\r\nvacancies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry to hear it,\" said Mrs. Atmore; and Miss Marianne, a\r\ntall, handsome girl of fifteen, looked disappointed. \"But perhaps I could strain a point, and find a place for her,\" resumed\r\nMr. Gummage, who knew very well that he never had the smallest idea of\r\nlimiting the number of his pupils, and that if twenty more were to\r\napply, he would take them every one, however full his school might be. \"Do pray, Mr. Gummage,\" said Mrs. Atmore; \"do try and make an exertion\r\nto admit my daughter; I shall regard it as a particular favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe she may come,\" replied Gummage: \"I suppose I can take\r\nher. Has she any turn for drawing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Mrs. Atmore, \"she has never tried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, madam,\" said Mr. Gummage, \"what do you wish your daughter to\r\nlearn? figures, flowers, or landscape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! all three,\" replied Mrs. Atmore. \"We have been furnishing our new\r\nhouse, and I told Mr. Atmore that he need not get any pictures for the\r\nfront parlor, as I would much prefer having them all painted by\r\nMarianne. She has been four quarters with Miss Julia, and has worked\r\nFriendship and Innocence, which cost, altogether, upwards of a hundred\r\ndollars. Do you know the piece, Mr. Gummage? There is a tomb with a\r\nweeping willow, and two ladies with long hair, one dressed in pink, the\r\nother in blue, holding a wreath between them over the top of the urn. The ladies are Friendship. Then on the right hand of the piece is a\r\ncottage, and an oak, and a little girl dressed in yellow, sitting on a\r\ngreen bank, and putting a wreath round the neck of a lamb. Nothing can\r\nbe more natural than the lamb's wool. It is done entirely in French\r\nknots. The child and the lamb are Innocence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Gummage, \"I know the piece well enough--I've drawn them\r\nby dozens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Mrs. Atmore, \"this satin piece hangs over the front\r\nparlor mantel. It is much prettier and better done than the one Miss\r\nLongstitch worked of Charlotte at the tomb of Werter, though she did sew\r\nsilver spangles all over Charlotte's lilac gown, and used chenille, at a\r\nfi'-penny-bit a needleful, for all the banks and the large tree. Now, as\r\nthe mantel-piece is provided for, I wish a landscape for each of the\r\nrecesses, and a figure-piece to hang on each side of the large\r\nlooking-glass, with flower-pieces under them, all by Marianne.

You can have a good cipher in the center, and the colors may be\r\nas bright as you please. India ware is generally painted with one color\r\nonly; but the Chinese are submissive animals, and will do just as they\r\nare bid.

A wreath was selected from the portfolio that contained the engravings\r\nand drawings of flowers. It was decided that Marianne should first\r\nexecute it the full size of the model (which was as large as nature),\r\nthat she might immediately have a piece to frame; and that she was\r\nafterwards to make a smaller copy of it, as a border for all the\r\narticles of the china set; the middle to be ornamented with the letter\r\nA, in gold, surrounded by the rays of a golden star. Sprigs and tendrils\r\nof the flowers were to branch down from the border, so as nearly to\r\nreach the gilding in the middle. The large wreath that was intended to\r\nframe was to bear in its center the initials of Marianne Atmore, being\r\nthe letters M.A. painted in shell gold. \"And so,\" said Mr. Gummage, \"having a piece to frame, and a pattern for\r\nyour china, you'll kill two birds with one stone.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday, the young lady came to take her first lesson,\r\nfollowed by a mulatto boy, carrying a little black morocco trunk, that\r\ncontained a four-row box of Reeves's colors, with an assortment of\r\ncamel's-hair pencils, half a dozen white saucers, a water cup, a\r\nlead-pencil and a piece of India rubber. Mr. Gummage immediately\r\nsupplied her with two bristle brushes, and sundry little shallow earthen\r\ncups, each containing a modicum of some sort of body color, massicot,\r\nflake-white, etc., prepared by himself and charged at a quarter of a\r\ndollar apiece, and which he told her she would want when she came to do\r\nlandscapes and figures. Mr. Gummage's style was to put in the sky, water and distances with\r\nopaque paints, and the most prominent objects with transparent colors. This was probably the reason that his foregrounds seemed always to be\r\nsunk in his backgrounds. The model was scarcely considered as a guide,\r\nfor he continually told his pupils that they must try to excel it; and\r\nhe helped them to do so by making all his skies deep red fire at the\r\nbottom, and dark blue smoke at the top; and exactly reversing the colors\r\non the water, by putting red at the top and the blue at the bottom. The\r\ndistant mountains were lilac and white, and the near rocks buff color,\r\nshaded with purple. The castles and abbeys were usually gamboge.

When Marianne had covered all her saucers with colors, and wasted ten\r\ntimes as much as was necessary, she was eager to commence painting, as\r\nshe called it; and in trying to wash the rose with lake, she daubed it\r\non of crimson thickness. When Mr. Gummage saw it, he gave her a severe\r\nreprimand for meddling with her own piece. It was with great difficulty\r\nthat the superabundant color was removed; and he charged her to let the\r\nflowers alone till he was ready to wash them for her. He worked a little\r\nat the piece every day, forbidding Marianne to touch it; and she\r\nremained idle while he was putting in skies, mountains, etc., for the\r\nother young ladies.

During the year that followed the departure of the ship _Voltaire_ great\r\nimpatience for her return was manifested by the ladies of the Atmore\r\nfamily,--anxious to see how the china would look, and frequently hoping\r\nthat the colors would be bright enough, and none of the flowers\r\nomitted--that the gilding would be rich, and everything inserted in its\r\nproper place, exactly according to the pattern. Mrs. Atmore's only\r\nregret was, that she had not sent for a tea-set also; not that she was\r\nin want of one, but then it would be so much better to have a dinner-set\r\nand a tea-set precisely alike, and Marianne's beautiful wreath on all. \"Why, my dear,\" said Mr. Atmore, \"how often have I heard you say that\r\nyou would never have another _tea_-set from Canton, because the Chinese\r\npersist in making the principal articles of such old-fashioned, awkward\r\nshapes. For my part, I always disliked the tall coffee-pots, with their\r\nstraight spouts, looking like light-houses with bowsprits to them; and\r\nthe short, clumsy teapots, with their twisted handles, and lids that\r\nalways fall off.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said Mrs. Atmore, \"I have been looking forward to the\r\ntime when we can get a French tea-set upon tolerable terms. But in the\r\nmeanwhile I should be very glad to have cups and saucers with Marianne's\r\nbeautiful wreath, and of course when we use them on the table we should\r\nalways bring forward our silver pots.\"\r\n\r\nSpring returned, and there was much watching of the vanes, and great joy\r\nwhen they pointed easterly, and the ship-news now became the most\r\ninteresting column of the papers. A vessel that had sailed from New York\r\nto Canton on the same day the _Voltaire_ departed from Philadelphia had\r\nalready got in; therefore, the _Voltaire_ might be hourly expected. At\r\nlength she was reported below; and at this period the river Delaware\r\nsuffered much, in comparison with the river Hudson, owing to the\r\ntediousness of its navigation from the capes to the city. At last the _Voltaire_ cast anchor at the foot of Market Street, and our\r\nladies could scarcely refrain from walking down to the wharf to see the\r\nship that held the box that held the china. But invitations were\r\nimmediately sent out for a long projected dinner-party, which Mrs. Atmore had persuaded her husband to defer till they could exhibit the\r\nbeautiful new porcelain. The box was landed, and conveyed to the house. The whole family were\r\npresent at the opening, which was performed in the dining-room by Mr. Atmore himself--all the servants peeping in at the door. As soon as a\r\npart of the lid was split off, and a handful of the straw removed, a\r\npile of plates appeared, all separately wrapped in India paper. Each of\r\nthe family snatched up a plate and hastily tore off the covering. There\r\nwere the flowers glowing in beautiful colors, and the gold star and the\r\ngold A, admirably executed. But under the gold star, on every plate,\r\ndish and tureen were the words, \"THIS IN THE MIDDLE!\"--being the\r\ndirection which the literal and exact Chinese had minutely copied from a\r\ncrooked line that Mr. Atmore had hastily scrawled on the pattern with a\r\nvery bad pen, and of course without the slightest fear of its being\r\ninserted _verbatim_ beneath the central ornament.

His heart was open as the day,\r\n      His feelings all were true;\r\n    His hair was some inclined to gray--\r\n      He wore it in a queue. Whene'er he heard the voice of pain,\r\n      His breast with pity burn'd;\r\n    The large, round head upon his cane\r\n      From ivory was turn'd. Kind words he ever had for all;\r\n      He knew no base design:\r\n    His eyes were dark and rather small,\r\n      His nose was aquiline. He lived at peace with all mankind,\r\n      In friendship he was true;\r\n    His coat had pocket-holes behind,\r\n      His pantaloons were blue. Unharm'd, the sin which earth pollutes\r\n      He pass'd securely o'er,\r\n    And never wore a pair of boots\r\n      For thirty years or more. But good old Grimes is now at rest,\r\n      Nor fears misfortune's frown:\r\n    He wore a double-breasted vest--\r\n      The stripes ran up and down. He modest merit sought to find,\r\n      And pay it its desert:\r\n    He had no malice in his mind,\r\n      No ruffles on his shirt. His neighbors he did not abuse--\r\n      Was sociable and gay:\r\n    He wore large buckles on his shoes,\r\n      And changed them every day. His knowledge hid from public gaze,\r\n      He did not bring to view,\r\n    Nor made a noise town-meeting days,\r\n      As many people do. His worldly goods he never threw\r\n      In trust to fortune's chances,\r\n    But lived (as all his brothers do)\r\n      In easy circumstances. Thus undisturb'd by anxious cares,\r\n      His peaceful moments ran;\r\n    And everybody said he was\r\n      A fine old gentleman.

The fact is,\r\n     Miss Pelican is a very ordinary actress; indeed, one of the most\r\n     indifferent ones we have ever happened to see. She came here from\r\n     the Museum at Fort Laramie, and we praised her so injudiciously\r\n     that she became completely spoiled. She has performed a round of\r\n     characters during the last week, very miserably, though we are\r\n     bound to confess that her performance of King Lear last evening was\r\n     superior to anything of the kind we ever saw. Miss Pelican is about\r\n     forty-three years of age, singularly plain in her personal\r\n     appearance, awkward and embarrassed, with a cracked and squeaking\r\n     voice, and really dresses quite outrageously. _She has much to\r\n     learn--poor thing!_\r\n\r\nI take it the above notices are rather ingenious. The fact is, I'm no\r\njudge of acting, and don't know how Miss Pelican will turn out. If well,\r\nwhy there's my notice of June the 1st; if ill, then June 31st comes in\r\nplay, and, as there is but one copy of the Sentinel printed, it's an\r\neasy matter to destroy the incorrect one; _both can't be wrong_; so I've\r\nmade a sure thing of it in any event. Here follows my musical critique,\r\nwhich I flatter myself is of rather superior order:\r\n\r\nTHE PLAINS. ODE SYMPHONIE PAR JABEZ TARBOX.--This glorious composition\r\nwas produced at the San Diego Odeon on the 31st of June, ult., for the\r\nfirst time in this or any other country, by a very full orchestra (the\r\nperformance taking place immediately after supper), and a chorus\r\ncomposed of the entire \"Sauer Kraut-Verein,\" the \"Wee Gates\r\nAssociation,\" and choice selections from the \"Gyascutus\" and\r\n\"Pike-harmonic\" societies. The solos were rendered by Herr Tuden Links,\r\nthe recitations by Herr Von Hyden Schnapps, both performers being\r\nassisted by Messrs. John Smith and Joseph Brown, who held their coats,\r\nfanned them, and furnished water during the more overpowering passages. \"The Plains\" we consider the greatest musical achievement that has been\r\npresented to an enraptured public.", "sentences": ["Coming among us unheralded, almost\r\n     unknown, without claptrap, in a wagon drawn by oxen across the\r\n     plains, with no agent to get up a counterfeit enthusiasm in her\r\n     favor, she appeared before us for the first time at the San Diego\r\n     Lyceum last evening, in the trying and difficult character of\r\n     Ingomar, or the Tame Savage.", "We are at a loss to describe our\r\n     sensations, our admiration, at her magnificent, her super-human\r\n     efforts.", "We do not hesitate to say that she is by far the superior\r\n     to any living actress; and, as we believe that to be the perfection\r\n     of acting, we cannot be wrong in the belief that no one hereafter\r\n     will ever be found to approach her.", "Her conception of the character\r\n     of Ingomar was perfection itself; her playful and ingenuous manner,\r\n     her light girlish laughter, in the scene with Sir Peter, showed an\r\n     appreciation of the savage character which nothing but the most\r\n     arduous study, the most elaborate training could produce; while her\r\n     awful change to the stern, unyielding, uncompromising father in the\r\n     tragic scene of Duncan's murder, was indeed nature itself.", "Miss\r\n     Pelican is about seventeen years of age, of miraculous beauty, and\r\n     most thrilling voice.", "It is needless to say she dresses admirably,\r\n     as in fact we have said all we can say when we called her, most\r\n     truthfully, perfection.", "Mr.", "John Boots took the part of Parthenia\r\n     very creditably, etc., etc.", "_From the Vallecetos Sentinel, June 31st_\r\n\r\n     MISS PELICAN.--As this lady is about to leave us to commence an\r\n     engagement on the San Francisco stage, we should regret exceedingly\r\n     if anything we have said about her should send with her a\r\n     _prestige_ which might be found undeserved on trial.", "The fact is,\r\n     Miss Pelican is a very ordinary actress; indeed, one of the most\r\n     indifferent ones we have ever happened to see.", "She came here from\r\n     the Museum at Fort Laramie, and we praised her so injudiciously\r\n     that she became completely spoiled.", "She has performed a round of\r\n     characters during the last week, very miserably, though we are\r\n     bound to confess that her performance of King Lear last evening was\r\n     superior to anything of the kind we ever saw.", "Miss Pelican is about\r\n     forty-three years of age, singularly plain in her personal\r\n     appearance, awkward and embarrassed, with a cracked and squeaking\r\n     voice, and really dresses quite outrageously.", "_She has much to\r\n     learn--poor thing!_\r\n\r\nI take it the above notices are rather ingenious.", "The fact is, I'm no\r\njudge of acting, and don't know how Miss Pelican will turn out.", "If well,\r\nwhy there's my notice of June the 1st; if ill, then June 31st comes in\r\nplay, and, as there is but one copy of the Sentinel printed, it's an\r\neasy matter to destroy the incorrect one; _both can't be wrong_; so I've\r\nmade a sure thing of it in any event.", "Here follows my musical critique,\r\nwhich I flatter myself is of rather superior order:\r\n\r\nTHE PLAINS.", "ODE SYMPHONIE PAR JABEZ TARBOX.--This glorious composition\r\nwas produced at the San Diego Odeon on the 31st of June, ult., for the\r\nfirst time in this or any other country, by a very full orchestra (the\r\nperformance taking place immediately after supper), and a chorus\r\ncomposed of the entire \"Sauer Kraut-Verein,\" the \"Wee Gates\r\nAssociation,\" and choice selections from the \"Gyascutus\" and\r\n\"Pike-harmonic\" societies.", "The solos were rendered by Herr Tuden Links,\r\nthe recitations by Herr Von Hyden Schnapps, both performers being\r\nassisted by Messrs.", "John Smith and Joseph Brown, who held their coats,\r\nfanned them, and furnished water during the more overpowering passages.", "\"The Plains\" we consider the greatest musical achievement that has been\r\npresented to an enraptured public."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Unknown Author"}, {"id": "txt_de_19323_10", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Wit and Humor of America, Volume V.

Its strains at times remind us of\r\nthose of the old master of the steamer McKim, who never went to sea\r\nwithout being unpleasantly affected;--a straining after effect he used\r\nto term it. Blair in his lecture on beauty, and Mills in his treatise on\r\nlogic, (p. 31,) have alluded to the feeling which might be produced in\r\nthe human mind by something of this transcendentally sublime\r\ndescription, but it has remained for M. Tarbox, in the production of\r\n\"The Plains,\" to call this feeling forth. The symphonie opens upon the wide and boundless plains in longitude 115\r\ndegrees W., latitude 35 degrees 21 minutes 03 seconds N., and about\r\nsixty miles from the west bank of Pitt River. These data are beautifully\r\nand clearly expressed by a long (topographically) drawn note from an E\r\nflat clarionet. The sandy nature of the soil, sparsely dotted with\r\nbunches of cactus and artemisia, the extended view, flat and unbroken to\r\nthe horizon, save by the rising smoke in the extreme verge, denoting the\r\nvicinity of a Pi Utah village, are represented by the bass drum. A few\r\nnotes on the piccolo call attention to a solitary antelope picking up\r\nmescal beans in the foreground. The sun, having an altitude of 36\r\ndegrees 27 minutes, blazes down upon the scene in indescribable majesty. \"Gradually the sounds roll forth in a song\" of rejoicing to the God of\r\nDay:\r\n\r\n    \"Of thy intensity\r\n    And great immensity\r\n      Now then we sing;\r\n    Beholding in gratitude\r\n    Thee in this latitude,\r\n      Curious thing.\"\r\n\r\nWhich swells out into \"Hey Jim along, Jim along Josey,\" then\r\n_decrescendo_, _mas o menos_, _poco pocita_, dies away and dries up. Suddenly we hear approaching a train from Pike County, consisting of\r\nseven families, with forty-six wagons, each drawn by thirteen oxen; each\r\nfamily consists of a man in butternut-colored clothing driving the oxen;\r\na wife in butternut-colored clothing riding in the wagon, holding a\r\nbutternut baby, and seventeen butternut children running promiscuously\r\nabout the establishment; all are barefooted, dusty, and smell\r\nunpleasantly. (All these circumstances are expressed by pretty rapid\r\nfiddling for some minutes, winding up with a puff from the orpheclide\r\nplayed by an intoxicated Teuton with an atrocious breath--it is\r\nimpossible to misunderstand the description.)

The unpacking of the kettles and mess-pans, the\r\nunyoking of the oxen, the gathering about the various camp-fires, the\r\nfrizzling of the pork, are so clearly expressed by the music that the\r\nmost untutored savage could readily comprehend it. Indeed, so vivid and\r\nlifelike was the representation, that a lady sitting near us\r\ninvoluntarily exclaimed aloud, at a certain passage, \"_Thar, that pork's\r\nburning!_\" and it was truly interesting to watch the gratified\r\nexpression of her face when, by a few notes of the guitar, the pan was\r\nremoved from the fire, and the blazing pork extinguished.

JOHN PHOENIX. SAN DIEGO OBSERVATORY, September 1, 1854. *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLECTURES ON ASTRONOMY--PART I\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe term Astronomy is derived from two Latin words,--_Astra_, a star,\r\nand _onomy_, a science; and literally means the science of the stars. \"It is a science,\" to quote our friend Dick (who was no relation at all\r\nof Big Dick, though the latter occasionally caused individuals to see\r\nstars), \"which has, in all ages, engaged the attention of the poet, the\r\nphilosopher, and the divine, and been the subject of their study and\r\nadmiration.\"\r\n\r\nBy the wondrous discoveries of the improved telescopes of modern times,\r\nwe ascertain that upward of several hundred millions of stars exist,\r\nthat are invisible to the naked eye--the nearest of which is millions of\r\nmillions of miles from the Earth; and as we have every reason to suppose\r\nthat every one of this inconceivable number of worlds is peopled like\r\nour own, a consideration of this fact--and that we are undoubtedly as\r\nsuperior to these beings as we are to the rest of mankind--is calculated\r\nto fill the mind of the American with a due sense of his own importance\r\nin the scale of animated creation. It is supposed that each of the stars we see in the Heavens in a\r\ncloudless night is a sun shining upon its own curvilinear, with light of\r\nits own manufacture; and as it would be absurd to suppose its light and\r\nheat were made to be diffused for nothing, it is presumed farther, that\r\neach sun, like an old hen, is provided with a parcel of little chickens,\r\nin the way of planets, which, shining but feebly by its reflected light,\r\nare to us invisible. To this opinion we are led, also, by reasoning from\r\nanalogy, on considering our own Solar System. THE SOLAR SYSTEM is so called, not because we believe it to be the sole\r\nsystem of the kind in existence, but from its principal body, the Sun,\r\nthe Latin name of which is _Sol_.

This reminds us of the simplicity of a child we once saw in a\r\nrailroad-car, who fancied itself perfectly stationary, and thought the\r\nfences, houses and fields were tearing past it at the rate of thirty\r\nmiles an hour;--and poking out its head, to see where on earth they went\r\nto, had its hat--a very nice one with pink ribbons--knocked off and\r\nirrecoverably lost. But Copernicus (who was a son of Daniel Pernicus, of\r\nthe firm of Pernicus & Co., wool-dealers, and who was named Co. Pernicus, out of respect to his father's partners) soon set this matter\r\nto rights, and started the idea of the present Solar System, which,\r\ngreatly improved since his day, is occasionally called the Copernican\r\nsystem. By this system we learn that the Sun is stationed at one _focus_\r\n(not hocus, as it is rendered, without authority by the philosopher\r\nPartington) of an ellipse, where it slowly grinds on for ever about its\r\nown axis, while the planets, turning about their axes, revolve in\r\nelliptical orbits of various dimensions and different planes of\r\ninclination around it. The demonstration of this system in all its perfection was left to Isaac\r\nNewton, an English Philosopher, who, seeing an apple tumble down from a\r\ntree, was led to think thereon with such gravity, that he finally\r\ndiscovered the attraction of gravitation, which proved to be the great\r\nlaw of Nature that keeps everything in its place. Thus we see that as\r\nan apple originally brought sin and ignorance into the world, the same\r\nfruit proved thereafter the cause of vast knowledge and\r\nenlightenment;--and indeed we may doubt whether any other fruit but an\r\napple, and a sour one at that, would have produced these great\r\nresults;--for, had the fallen fruit been a pear, an orange, or a peach,\r\nthere is little doubt that Newton would have eaten it up and thought no\r\nmore on the subject. As in this world you will hardly ever find a man so small but that he\r\nhas someone else smaller than he, to look up to and revolve around him,\r\nso in the Solar System we find that the majority of the planets have one\r\nor more smaller planets revolving about them. These small bodies are\r\ntermed secondaries, moons or satellites--the planets themselves being\r\ncalled primaries. We know at present of eighteen primaries, viz.: Mercury, Venus, the\r\nEarth, Mars, Flora, Vesta, Iris, Metis, Hebe, Astrea, Juno, Ceres,\r\nPallas, Hygeia, Jupiter, Saturn, Herschel, Neptune, and another, yet\r\nunnamed. There are distributed among these, nineteen secondaries, all of\r\nwhich, except our Moon, are invisible to the naked eye. We shall now proceed to consider, separately, the different bodies\r\ncomposing the Solar System, and to make known what little information,\r\ncomparatively speaking, science has collected regarding them. And, first\r\nin order, as in place, we come to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN\r\n\r\nThis glorious orb may be seen almost any clear day, by looking intently\r\nin its direction, through a piece of smoked glass.

It is, however, somewhat larger, being in fact 887,000 miles in\r\ndiameter, and containing a volume of matter equal to fourteen hundred\r\nthousand globes of the size of the Earth, which is certainly a matter of\r\nno small importance.

A scientific friend of ours from New England (Mr. R.W. Emerson) while traveling through the northern part of Norway, with a\r\ncargo of tinware, on the 21st of June, 1836, distinctly saw the Sun in\r\nall its majesty, shining at midnight!--in fact, shining _all_ night! Emerson is not what you would call a superstitious man, by any\r\nmeans--but, he left! Since that time many persons have observed its\r\nnocturnal appearance in that part of the country, at the same time of\r\nthe year. This phenomenon has never been witnessed in the latitude of\r\nSan Diego, however, and it is very improbable that it ever will be. Sacred history informs us that a distinguished military man, named\r\nJoshua, once caused the Sun to \"stand still\"; how he did it, is not\r\nmentioned. There can, of course, be no doubt of the fact, that he\r\narrested its progress, and possibly caused it to \"stand _still_\";--but\r\ntranslators are not always perfectly accurate, and we are inclined to\r\nthe opinion that it might have wiggled a very little, when Joshua was\r\nnot looking directly at it. The statement, however, does not appear so\r\nvery incredible, when we reflect that seafaring men are in the habit of\r\nactually _bringing the Sun down_ to the horizon every day at 12\r\nMeridian. This they effect by means of a tool made of brass, glass, and\r\nsilver, called a sextant. The composition of the Sun has long been a\r\nmatter of dispute. By close and accurate observation with an excellent opera-glass we have\r\narrived at the conclusion that its entire surface is covered with water\r\nto a very great depth; which water, being composed by a process known at\r\npresent only to the Creator of the Universe and Mr. Paine, of Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts, generates carburetted hydrogen gas, which, being\r\ninflamed, surrounds the entire body with an ocean of fire, from which\r\nwe, and the other planets, receive our light and heat. The spots upon\r\nits surface are glimpses of water, obtained through the fire; and we\r\ncall the attention of our old friend and former schoolmate, Mr. Agassiz,\r\nto this fact; as by closely observing one of these spots with a strong\r\nrefracting telescope he may discover a new species of fish, with little\r\nfishes inside of them. It is possible that the Sun may burn out after a\r\nwhile, which would leave this world in a state of darkness quite\r\nuncomfortable to contemplate; but even under these circumstances it is\r\npleasant to reflect that courting and love-making would probably\r\nincrease to an indefinite extent, and that many persons would make large\r\nfortunes by the sudden rise in value of coal, wood, candles, and gas,\r\nwhich would go to illustrate the truth of the old proverb, \"It's an ill\r\nwind that blows nobody any good.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the Sun is a glorious creation; pleasing to gaze upon\r\n(through smoked glass), elevating to think upon, and exceedingly\r\ncomfortable to every created being on a cold day; it is the largest, the\r\nbrightest, and may be considered by far the most magnificent object in\r\nthe celestial sphere; though with all these attributes it must be\r\nconfessed that it is occasionally entirely eclipsed by the moon.

The difficulty of communication\r\nwith Mercury will probably prevent its ever being selected as a military\r\npost; though it possesses many advantages for that purpose, being\r\nextremely inaccessible, inconvenient, and, doubtless, singularly\r\nuncomfortable. It receives its name from the God, Mercury, in the\r\nHeathen Mythology, who is the patron and tutelary Divinity of San Diego\r\nCounty. VENUS\r\n\r\nThis beautiful planet may be seen either a little after sunset or\r\nshortly before sunrise, according as it becomes the morning or the\r\nevening star, but never departing quite forty-eight degrees from the\r\nSun.

Venus, in Mythology, was a Goddess of singular beauty, who became the\r\nwife of Vulcan, the blacksmith, and, we regret to add, behaved in the\r\nmost immoral manner after her marriage. The celebrated case of Vulcan\r\n_vs._ Mars, and the consequent scandal, is probably still fresh in the\r\nminds of our readers. By a large portion of society, however, she was\r\nconsidered an ill-used and persecuted lady, against whose high tone of\r\nmorals and strictly virtuous conduct not a shadow of suspicion could be\r\ncast; Vulcan, by the same parties, was considered a horrid brute, and\r\nthey all agreed that it served him right when he lost his case and had\r\nto pay the costs of court. Venus still remains the Goddess of Beauty,\r\nand not a few of her _proteges_ may be found in California. THE EARTH\r\n\r\nThe Earth, or as the Latins called it, Tellus (from which originated the\r\nexpression, \"Do tell us\"), is the third planet in the Solar System, and\r\nthe one on which we subsist, with all our important joys and sorrows. The San Diego Herald is published weekly on this planet, for five\r\ndollars per annum, payable invariably in advance. As the Earth is by no\r\nmeans the most important planet in the system, there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that it is particularly distinguished from the others by being\r\ninhabited. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that all the other\r\nplanets of the system are filled with living, moving and sentient\r\nbeings; and as some of them are superior to the Earth in size and\r\nposition, it is not improbable that their inhabitants may be superior to\r\nus in physical and mental organization. But if this were a demonstrable fact, instead of a mere hypothesis, it\r\nwould be found a very difficult matter to persuade us of its truth. To\r\nthe inhabitants of Venus the Earth appears like a brilliant star--very\r\nmuch, in fact, as Venus appears to us; and, reasoning from analogy, we\r\nare led to believe that the election of Mr. Pierce, the European war, or\r\nthe split in the great Democratic party produced but very little\r\nexcitement among them.

Gazing with\r\ncurious eye, his attention is suddenly attracted by the movements of a\r\ngrand celebration of Fourth of July in New York, or a mighty convention\r\nin Baltimore. \"God bless my soul,\" he exclaims, \"I declare they're\r\nalive, these little creatures; do see them wriggle!\" To an inhabitant of\r\nthe Sun, however, he of Jupiter is probably quite as insignificant, and\r\nthe Sun man is possibly a mere atom in the opinion of a dweller in\r\nSirius. A little reflection on these subjects leads to the opinion that\r\nthe death of an individual man on this Earth, though perhaps as\r\nimportant an event as can occur to himself, is calculated to cause no\r\ngreat convulsion of Nature or disturb particularly the great aggregate\r\nof created beings. The Earth moves round the Sun from west to east in a year, and turns on\r\nits axis in a day; thus moving at the rate of 68,000 miles an hour in\r\nits orbit, and rolling around at the tolerably rapid rate of 1,040\r\nmiles per hour. As our readers may have seen that when a man is\r\ngalloping a horse violently over a smooth road, if the horse from\r\nviciousness or other cause suddenly stops, the man keeps on at the same\r\nrate over the animal's head; so we, supposing the Earth to be suddenly\r\narrested on its axis, men, women, children, horses, cattle and sheep,\r\ndonkeys, editors and members of Congress, with all our goods and\r\nchattels, would be thrown off into the air at a speed of 173 miles a\r\nminute, every mother's son of us describing the arc of a parabola, which\r\nis probably the only description we should ever be able to give of the\r\naffair. This catastrophe, to one sufficiently collected to enjoy it, would,\r\ndoubtless, be exceedingly amusing; but as there would probably be no\r\ntime for laughing, we pray that it may not occur until after our demise;\r\nwhen, should it take place, our monument will probably accompany the\r\nmovement. It is a singular fact that if a man travel round the Earth in\r\nan eastwardly direction he will find, on returning to the place of\r\ndeparture, he has gained one whole day; the reverse of this proposition\r\nbeing true also, it follows that the Yankees who are constantly\r\ntraveling to the West do not live as long by a day or two as they would\r\nif they had stayed at home; and supposing each Yankee's time to be worth\r\n$1.50 per day, it may be easily shown that a considerable amount of\r\nmoney is annually lost by their roving dispositions. Science is yet but in its infancy; with its growth, new discoveries of\r\nan astounding nature will doubtless be made, among which, probably, will\r\nbe some method by which the course of the Earth may be altered and it\r\nbe steered with the same ease and regularity through space and among the\r\nstars as a steamboat is now directed through the water. It will be a\r\nvery interesting spectacle to see the Earth \"rounding to,\" with her head\r\nto the air, off Jupiter, while the Moon is sent off laden with mails and\r\npassengers for that planet, to bring back the return mails and a large\r\nparty of rowdy Jupiterians going to attend a grand prize fight in the\r\nring of Saturn. Well, Christopher Columbus would have been just as much astonished at a\r\nrevelation of the steamboat and the locomotive engine as we should be to\r\nwitness the above performance, which our intelligent posterity during\r\nthe ensuing year A.D. 2000 will possibly look upon as a very ordinary\r\nand common-place affair.

THE MOON\r\n\r\nThis resplendent luminary, like a youth on the Fourth of July, has its\r\nfirst quarter; like a ruined spendthrift its last quarter, and like an\r\nomnibus, is occasionally full and new. The evenings on which it appears\r\nbetween these last stages are beautifully illumined by its clear, mellow\r\nlight. The Moon revolves in an elliptical orbit about the Earth in twenty-nine\r\ndays twelve hours forty-four minutes and three seconds, the time which\r\nelapses between one new Moon and another. It was supposed by the ancient\r\nphilosophers that the Moon was made of green cheese, an opinion still\r\nentertained by the credulous and ignorant. Kepler and Tyco Brahe,\r\nhowever, held to the opinion that it was composed of Charlotte Russe,\r\nthe dark portions of its surface being sponge cake, the light _blanc\r\nmange_. Modern advances in science and the use of Lord Rosse's famous\r\ntelescope have demonstrated the absurdity of all these speculations by\r\nproving conclusively that the Moon is mainly composed of the\r\n_Ferro_--_sesqui_--_cyanuret, of the cyanide of potassium_! Up to the\r\nlatest dates from the Atlantic States, no one has succeeded in reaching\r\nthe Moon. Should anyone do so hereafter, it will probably be a woman, as\r\nthe sex will never cease making an exertion for that purpose as long as\r\nthere is a man in it. Upon the whole, we may consider the Moon an excellent institution, among\r\nthe many we enjoy under a free, republican form of government, and it is\r\na blessed thing to reflect that the President of the United States can\r\nnot _veto_ it, no matter how strong an inclination he may feel, from\r\nprinciple or habit, to do so. It has been ascertained beyond a doubt that the Moon has no air. Consequently, the common expressions, \"the Moon was gazing down with an\r\nair of benevolence,\" or with \"an air of complacency,\" or with \"an air of\r\ncalm superiority,\" are incorrect and objectionable, the fact being that\r\nthe Moon has no air at all. The existence of the celebrated \"Man in the Moon\" has been frequently\r\nquestioned by modern philosophers. The whole subject is involved in\r\ndoubt and obscurity. The only authority we have for believing that such\r\nan individual exists, and has been seen and spoken with, is a fragment\r\nof an old poem composed by an ancient Astronomer of the name of Goose,\r\nwhich has been handed down to us as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The man in the Moon came down too soon\r\n      To inquire the way to Norwich;\r\n    The man in the South, he burned his mouth,\r\n      Eating cold, hot porridge.\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence conveyed in this distich is, however, rejected by the\r\nskeptical, among modern Astronomers, who consider the passage an\r\nallegory. \"The man in the South,\" being supposed typical of the late\r\nJohn C.

As they came nearer, Dickey saw that it\r\nwas an old man carrying on his back, at each side and in front of him,\r\nsome part or piece of almost every imaginable thing. Umbrellas, chair\r\nbottoms, panes of glass, knives, forks, pans, dusters, tubs, spoons and\r\nstove-lids, graters and grind-stones, saws and samovars,--\"Almost\r\neverything one could possibly think of,\" said Dickey to himself. The moment that the Fantasm caught sight of the strange figure he\r\nstopped, and Dickey noticed that his face, which was tucked securely\r\nunder his left arm, turned quite pale. \"Gracious me!\" he exclaimed in a thoroughly frightened way. \"There's the\r\nItinerant Tinker again! Now,\" he added hastily and dolefully, \"I shall\r\nhave to leave you and run for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you're surely not afraid of _him_!\" Dickey exclaimed\r\nincredulously. Dickey was really surprised, for the old man, so far as\r\nhe could judge from that distance, wore an extremely mild and kindly\r\nlook. \"Why do you have to run?\" he asked. \"Why? _Why?_\" the Fantasm fairly shouted. \"I told you a moment ago that\r\nhe was the _Itinerant Tinker_! He tries to mend every broken and\r\nunbroken thing in Fantasma Land! Every time he catches me,\" went on the\r\nFantasm, as he edged cautiously away, \"he tries to glue on my head. It's\r\nvery annoying--and, besides, it hurts! Good-by, Dickey!\" he called, and\r\ndisappeared forthwith into the bushes. \"Isn't he a droll person?\" thought Dickey. \"He never stops with me more\r\nthan ten minutes at a time but what he either loses his head or runs\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nBy that time the Itinerant Tinker had come up to where Dickey stood. He\r\nsat wearily down on a boulder by the wayside, removed some of the\r\nheavier merchandise from off his back, and proceeded to mop his face\r\nvigorously with a great red handkerchief. Dickey waited several minutes\r\nfor the old man to speak; but the Itinerant Tinker only regarded him\r\nsolemnly. He did not even smile. \"It's very warm work, sir,\" ventured Dickey, at last, \"carrying all that\r\nstuff--isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff?\" returned the Itinerant Tinker, in a very mild, but unmistakably\r\nhurt tone of voice. \"Well--\" Dickey hesitated timidly. \"_Don't_ call them stuff, please,\" sighed the Itinerant Tinker; \"call\r\nthem necessary commodities.\"\r\n\r\n\"But whatever one _does_ call them,\" Dickey persisted, \"they still make\r\nyou warm to carry them all about, don't they?\"\r\n\r\nThe Itinerant Tinker nodded his head and sighed again. Again Dickey waited for a considerable space of time. But the old man\r\nwould have been perfectly content to sit there for ever, Dickey thought,\r\nwithout speaking. \"I _do_ wish he would talk,\" said he to himself. \"It's awfully annoying to have him sit there and look at one without\r\nsaying a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mend, sir?\" Dickey inquired at last. \"I tried once,\" sighed the Itinerant Tinker, sadly, \"to mend the break\r\nof day. It took me twenty-seven hours and eleven minutes to fix it, and\r\nit broke every twenty-four. At that rate how long would it take to patch\r\nthem all together?\"\r\n\r\nAnother distressing silence. \"Have you figured _that_ out?\" whispered the Itinerant Tinker at length. \"I haven't tried,\" Dickey admitted. \"_I_ tried once,\" the Itinerant Tinker said, \"but I ran out of paper and\r\ngave it up. Then, when the night fell,\" he resumed dolefully, after\r\nanother long interval of silence, \"I tried to prop it up. But I met with\r\nthe same difficulty that confronted me in patching up the day, and was\r\nforced to abandon _that_ too.\"\r\n\r\n\"In which direction were you going when I met you?\" Dickey asked. The Itinerant Tinker pointed ahead of him along the path and mopped his\r\nbald head. \"But where?\" insisted Dickey. \"To the Crypt.", "sentences": ["THE ITINERANT TINKER\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES RAYMOND MACAULEY\r\n\r\n\r\nAway off in front, and coming toward them along the same path, appeared\r\na singularly misshapen figure.", "As they came nearer, Dickey saw that it\r\nwas an old man carrying on his back, at each side and in front of him,\r\nsome part or piece of almost every imaginable thing.", "Umbrellas, chair\r\nbottoms, panes of glass, knives, forks, pans, dusters, tubs, spoons and\r\nstove-lids, graters and grind-stones, saws and samovars,--\"Almost\r\neverything one could possibly think of,\" said Dickey to himself.", "The moment that the Fantasm caught sight of the strange figure he\r\nstopped, and Dickey noticed that his face, which was tucked securely\r\nunder his left arm, turned quite pale.", "\"Gracious me!\" he exclaimed in a thoroughly frightened way.", "\"There's the\r\nItinerant Tinker again!", "Now,\" he added hastily and dolefully, \"I shall\r\nhave to leave you and run for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you're surely not afraid of _him_!\" Dickey exclaimed\r\nincredulously.", "Dickey was really surprised, for the old man, so far as\r\nhe could judge from that distance, wore an extremely mild and kindly\r\nlook.", "\"Why do you have to run?\" he asked.", "\"Why?", "_Why?_\" the Fantasm fairly shouted.", "\"I told you a moment ago that\r\nhe was the _Itinerant Tinker_!", "He tries to mend every broken and\r\nunbroken thing in Fantasma Land!", "Every time he catches me,\" went on the\r\nFantasm, as he edged cautiously away, \"he tries to glue on my head.", "It's\r\nvery annoying--and, besides, it hurts!", "Good-by, Dickey!\" he called, and\r\ndisappeared forthwith into the bushes.", "\"Isn't he a droll person?\" thought Dickey.", "\"He never stops with me more\r\nthan ten minutes at a time but what he either loses his head or runs\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nBy that time the Itinerant Tinker had come up to where Dickey stood.", "He\r\nsat wearily down on a boulder by the wayside, removed some of the\r\nheavier merchandise from off his back, and proceeded to mop his face\r\nvigorously with a great red handkerchief.", "Dickey waited several minutes\r\nfor the old man to speak; but the Itinerant Tinker only regarded him\r\nsolemnly.", "He did not even smile.", "\"It's very warm work, sir,\" ventured Dickey, at last, \"carrying all that\r\nstuff--isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff?\" returned the Itinerant Tinker, in a very mild, but unmistakably\r\nhurt tone of voice.", "\"Well--\" Dickey hesitated timidly.", "\"_Don't_ call them stuff, please,\" sighed the Itinerant Tinker; \"call\r\nthem necessary commodities.\"\r\n\r\n\"But whatever one _does_ call them,\" Dickey persisted, \"they still make\r\nyou warm to carry them all about, don't they?\"\r\n\r\nThe Itinerant Tinker nodded his head and sighed again.", "Again Dickey waited for a considerable space of time.", "But the old man\r\nwould have been perfectly content to sit there for ever, Dickey thought,\r\nwithout speaking.", "\"I _do_ wish he would talk,\" said he to himself.", "\"It's awfully annoying to have him sit there and look at one without\r\nsaying a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mend, sir?\" Dickey inquired at last.", "\"I tried once,\" sighed the Itinerant Tinker, sadly, \"to mend the break\r\nof day.", "It took me twenty-seven hours and eleven minutes to fix it, and\r\nit broke every twenty-four.", "At that rate how long would it take to patch\r\nthem all together?\"\r\n\r\nAnother distressing silence.", "\"Have you figured _that_ out?\" whispered the Itinerant Tinker at length.", "\"I haven't tried,\" Dickey admitted.", "\"_I_ tried once,\" the Itinerant Tinker said, \"but I ran out of paper and\r\ngave it up.", "Then, when the night fell,\" he resumed dolefully, after\r\nanother long interval of silence, \"I tried to prop it up.", "But I met with\r\nthe same difficulty that confronted me in patching up the day, and was\r\nforced to abandon _that_ too.\"\r\n\r\n\"In which direction were you going when I met you?\" Dickey asked.", "The Itinerant Tinker pointed ahead of him along the path and mopped his\r\nbald head.", "\"But where?\" insisted Dickey.", "\"To the Crypt."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Unknown Author"}, {"id": "txt_de_19323_25", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Wit and Humor of America, Volume V.

THE STRIKE OF ONE\r\n\r\nBY ELLIOTT FLOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nDanny Burke was discharged.

As a matter of fact, he was a boy, and a\r\nsmall boy at that; but he would have scorned any description that did\r\nnot put him down as \"a good union man.\" Danny's environment had been one\r\nof uncompromising unionism, and that was what ailed him. He wanted to\r\nadvance the union idea. To this end, he undertook to organize the other\r\nmessengers in the branch office, advancing all the arguments that he had\r\nheard his mother and his father use in their discussions. The boys\r\nthought favorably of the scheme, but most of them were inclined to let\r\nsome one else do the experimenting. It might result disastrously. Just\r\nto encourage them, Danny became insolent, as he had already become\r\ninattentive; he told the manager what he would do and what he would not\r\ndo, and positively declined to deliver a message that would carry his\r\nwork a few minutes beyond quitting-time. Then Danny was discharged--and he laughed. Discharge _him_! Well, he'd\r\nshow them a thing or two. \"We'll arbitrate,\" he announced. \"Get out!\" ordered the manager. \"You got to arbitrate,\" insisted Danny. \"You got to confer with your men\r\nor you're goin' to have a strike!\" Danny had heard so much about\r\nconferences that he felt he was on safe ground now. \"We can't stand fer\r\nno autycrats!\" he added. \"You got to meet your men fair an' talk it\r\nover.

He had Danny by the collar before Danny knew what had happened, and the\r\nstruggling boy was marched to the door and pushed out. The boys who had\r\nrisen promptly subsided. Danny was too astonished for words. In all his extended hearsay\r\nknowledge of strikes he never had heard of anything like this. There was\r\nnothing heroic in it at all. He had expected a conference, and, instead,\r\nhe was ignominiously handled and thrust into the street. Danny sat down on a pile of paving-stones to think it over. Without\r\nreasoning the matter out, he now regarded himself as a union.

It did not\r\ntake him long to decide that the first thing to do was to \"picket the\r\nplant.\" That was a familiar phrase, and he knew the meaning of it. Everything was nicely arranged for him, too. The street was being paved,\r\nand he was sitting on some paving-stones, with a pile of gravel beside\r\nhim. He selected fifteen or twenty of the largest stones from the\r\ngravel-pile. A woman was the first victim. As she was about to enter the\r\nmessenger-office she was startled by a yell of warning from Danny. \"Hey, you!\" he shouted. \"Keep out!\"\r\n\r\nShe backed away hastily, and looked up to see if anything were about to\r\nfall on her. \"Why should I keep out?\" she asked at last. \"'Cause you'll git hit with a rock if you don't,\" was the prompt reply. \"But, little boy--\" she began. \"I ain't a little boy,\" asserted Danny. \"I'm a union.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman looked puzzled, but she finally decided that this was some\r\nboyish joke. \"You'd better run home,\" she said, and turned to enter the\r\nmessenger-office.

Then came another messenger, returning from a trip. \"What's the matter, Danny?\" he asked. \"Got the plant picketed,\" asserted Danny. \"Nobody can't go in or come\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm goin' in,\" said the other boy. \"You!\" exclaimed Danny scornfully, as he suddenly caught the boy and\r\nswung him over on to the stones. \"No, I ain't, Danny,\" the boy hastened to say, for Danny gave every\r\nevidence of an intent to batter in his face. \"Sure?\" asked Danny. \"Honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"This here's a strike,\" explained Danny. \"Oh, I didn't know that,\" apologized the boy. \"I ain't a\r\nstrike-breaker.\"\r\n\r\nDanny let him up, but made him sit on another pile of stones a short\r\ndistance away. He would be all right as long as he kept still, Danny\r\nexplained, but no longer. While Danny was continuing strike operations with rapidly growing\r\nenthusiasm, the woman he had first stopped was taking an unexpected part\r\nin the little comedy. She had gone to another of the branch offices with\r\nthe message she wished delivered, and had told of the trouble she had\r\nexperienced. Thereupon the manager of this office called up the manager\r\nof the other on the telephone. \"What's the matter over there?\" he asked. \"Nothing,\" was the surprised reply. \"Who said there was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, a woman has just reported that she was driven away by a boy with a\r\npile of stones.\"\r\n\r\nThe manager hastened to the window, and realized at once that something\r\nwas decidedly wrong. On a pile of paving-stones directly in front of the\r\ndoor sat the proud and happy Danny. At his feet there was a pile of\r\nsmaller stones, and he held a few in his hands. On his right was a boy\r\nwho had started on a trip a short time before, and on his left was one\r\nwho should have reported back. A man was gesticulating excitedly, a\r\nnumber of others and some boys were laughing, and Danny seemed to be\r\nintimating that any one who tried to enter would be hurt. \"Jim,\" said the manager to the largest messenger, \"go out there and see\r\nwhat's the matter with Danny Burke. Tell him I'll have him arrested if\r\nhe doesn't get out.\"\r\n\r\nDanny was a wise general. He wanted no prisoners that he could not\r\nhandle easily, and this big boy would be dangerous to have within his\r\nlines. The big boy was a sort of star messenger, who did not fraternize\r\nwith Danny anyhow. Consequently Danny fired a volley the moment he saw\r\nwho it was, and the big boy hastily retreated, bearing with him one bump\r\non the forehead. \"That's Jim,\" Danny explained to the increasing crowd. \"He's the\r\nbiggest, next to the boss.", "sentences": ["So, this being a strike of one, he was an entire union.", "It did not\r\ntake him long to decide that the first thing to do was to \"picket the\r\nplant.\" That was a familiar phrase, and he knew the meaning of it.", "Everything was nicely arranged for him, too.", "The street was being paved,\r\nand he was sitting on some paving-stones, with a pile of gravel beside\r\nhim.", "He selected fifteen or twenty of the largest stones from the\r\ngravel-pile.", "A woman was the first victim.", "As she was about to enter the\r\nmessenger-office she was startled by a yell of warning from Danny.", "\"Hey, you!\" he shouted.", "\"Keep out!\"\r\n\r\nShe backed away hastily, and looked up to see if anything were about to\r\nfall on her.", "\"Why should I keep out?\" she asked at last.", "\"'Cause you'll git hit with a rock if you don't,\" was the prompt reply.", "\"But, little boy--\" she began.", "\"I ain't a little boy,\" asserted Danny.", "\"I'm a union.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman looked puzzled, but she finally decided that this was some\r\nboyish joke.", "\"You'd better run home,\" she said, and turned to enter the\r\nmessenger-office.", "She could not refrain from looking over her shoulder,\r\nhowever, and she saw that he was poised for a throw.", "\"Don't do that!\" she cried hastily.", "\"You might hurt me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I'll hurt you,\" was the reply.", "\"I'll smash your block in if you\r\ndon't git a move on.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman decided to look for another messenger-office, and Danny,\r\ntriumphant, resumed his seat on the paving-stones.", "Then came another messenger, returning from a trip.", "\"What's the matter, Danny?\" he asked.", "\"Got the plant picketed,\" asserted Danny.", "\"Nobody can't go in or come\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm goin' in,\" said the other boy.", "\"You!\" exclaimed Danny scornfully, as he suddenly caught the boy and\r\nswung him over on to the stones.", "\"No, I ain't, Danny,\" the boy hastened to say, for Danny gave every\r\nevidence of an intent to batter in his face.", "\"Sure?\" asked Danny.", "\"Honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"This here's a strike,\" explained Danny.", "\"Oh, I didn't know that,\" apologized the boy.", "\"I ain't a\r\nstrike-breaker.\"\r\n\r\nDanny let him up, but made him sit on another pile of stones a short\r\ndistance away.", "He would be all right as long as he kept still, Danny\r\nexplained, but no longer.", "While Danny was continuing strike operations with rapidly growing\r\nenthusiasm, the woman he had first stopped was taking an unexpected part\r\nin the little comedy.", "She had gone to another of the branch offices with\r\nthe message she wished delivered, and had told of the trouble she had\r\nexperienced.", "Thereupon the manager of this office called up the manager\r\nof the other on the telephone.", "\"What's the matter over there?\" he asked.", "\"Nothing,\" was the surprised reply.", "\"Who said there was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, a woman has just reported that she was driven away by a boy with a\r\npile of stones.\"\r\n\r\nThe manager hastened to the window, and realized at once that something\r\nwas decidedly wrong.", "On a pile of paving-stones directly in front of the\r\ndoor sat the proud and happy Danny.", "At his feet there was a pile of\r\nsmaller stones, and he held a few in his hands.", "On his right was a boy\r\nwho had started on a trip a short time before, and on his left was one\r\nwho should have reported back.", "A man was gesticulating excitedly, a\r\nnumber of others and some boys were laughing, and Danny seemed to be\r\nintimating that any one who tried to enter would be hurt.", "\"Jim,\" said the manager to the largest messenger, \"go out there and see\r\nwhat's the matter with Danny Burke.", "Tell him I'll have him arrested if\r\nhe doesn't get out.\"\r\n\r\nDanny was a wise general.", "He wanted no prisoners that he could not\r\nhandle easily, and this big boy would be dangerous to have within his\r\nlines.", "The big boy was a sort of star messenger, who did not fraternize\r\nwith Danny anyhow.", "Consequently Danny fired a volley the moment he saw\r\nwho it was, and the big boy hastily retreated, bearing with him one bump\r\non the forehead.", "\"That's Jim,\" Danny explained to the increasing crowd.", "\"He's the\r\nbiggest, next to the boss."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Unknown Author"}, {"id": "txt_de_19323_29", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Wit and Humor of America, Volume V.

Danny picked out a stone considerably larger than the others, for he\r\nexpected the manager to appear next, and the manager had incurred his\r\npersonal enmity. In the case of his victims thus far, he had acted\r\nmerely on principle--to win his point. The manager appeared. For his own prestige (necessary to maintain\r\ndiscipline), the manager had to do something, but he felt reasonably\r\nsure that the dignity of his official position would make Danny less\r\nhasty and strenuous than he had been with others. The manager planned to\r\nextend the olive branch and at the same time raise the siege by\r\nbeckoning Danny in, so that he might reason with him and show him how\r\nsurely he would land in a police station if he would not consent to be a\r\ngood boy. This would be quicker and better than summoning an officer. But the manager got the big stone in the pit of his stomach just as he\r\nhad raised his hand to beckon, and he and his dignity collapsed\r\ntogether, with a most plebeian grunt. As he had not closed the door, he\r\nquickly rolled inside, where he lay on the floor with his hands on his\r\nstomach and listened to the joyous yelps of the crowd outside. This was\r\ntoo much for the manager. \"Call up police headquarters,\" he said, still holding his stomach as if\r\nfearful that it might become detached, \"and tell them there's a riot\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy addressed obeyed literally. Meanwhile Danny had decided that, as victory perched on his banners, it\r\nwas time to state the terms on which he would permit the enemy to\r\nsurrender, but he was too wise to put himself in the enemy's power\r\nbefore these terms were settled. \"Go in, Tim,\" was the order he gave to one of his prisoners, \"an' tell\r\nthe guy with the stomick-ache that when he recognizes the union an'\r\ngives me fifty cents more a week an' makes a work-day end when the clock\r\nstrikes, I'm willin' to call it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make him come down handsome,\" advised one of the loiterers. \"I guess I got 'em on the run,\" said Danny exultingly. But Tim went in and failed to come out. This was not Tim's fault,\r\nhowever, for the manager released his hold on his stomach long enough to\r\nget a grip on Tim's collar. The striker's defiance seemed to displease\r\nhim, and, because he could not shake Danny, he shook Tim, and he said\r\nthings to Tim that he would have preferred to say to Danny. Then his\r\nexcited harangue was interrupted by the sound of a gong, which convinced\r\nhim that he might again venture to the door. Danny was in the grasp of the strong arm of the law. A half dozen\r\npolicemen had valiantly rushed through the crowd and captured the entire\r\nbesieging party, which was Danny. \"What you doin'?\" demanded Danny angrily. \"What are _you_ doing?\" retorted the police sergeant in charge. \"This here's a strike,\" asserted Danny. \"I got the plant picketed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Run him in!\" ordered the manager from the doorway. \"What's the row?\" asked the sergeant. \"That's the row,\" said the manager, pointing to Danny. \"That!\" exclaimed the sergeant scornfully. \"You said it was a riot.

His experience as a policeman had left him\r\nvery much in doubt as to who were the public. Both sides to a\r\ncontroversy always claimed that distinction, and the law-breaker was\r\nusually the louder in his claims. Danny's inability to see anything but\r\nhis own side of the case was far from unusual. The captain took Danny into his private office and talked to him. The\r\ncaptain did not wish to lock up the boy, so he sent for Danny's father\r\nand also for the manager of the branch messenger-office. Meanwhile he\r\ntried to explain the matter to Danny, but Danny was obtuse. Why should\r\nnot he do as his father and his father's friends did? When they had a\r\ndisagreement with the boss, they picketed the plant, and ensuing\r\nincidents sent many people to the hospitals. Why was it worse for one\r\nboy to do this than it was for some hundreds or thousands of men? Danny\r\nwas confident that he was within his rights. \"Dad knows,\" he said in conclusion. \"Dad'll say I'm right. You got no\r\nbusiness mixin' in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dad's coming,\" the captain told him. The manager came first. \"The boy ought to be punished,\" said he. \"He hit\r\nme with a rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd seen him,\" said the beaming Danny to the captain, for the\r\nrecollection of that victory made all else seem trivial. \"Say! he\r\ndoubled up like a clown droppin' into a barrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he isn't punished,\" asserted the glowering manager, \"he'll get worse\r\nand worse and end by going to the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the captain. \"But just stand beside him a moment,\r\nplease. Don't dodge, Danny. He'll go behind the bars if he touches you. Stand side by side.\"\r\n\r\nThey did so. \"Now,\" said the captain to the manager, \"how do you think you'll look,\r\nstanding beside him in the police court and accusing him of assault and\r\nbattery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a fool,\" replied the manager promptly, forced to laugh in spite of\r\nhimself. \"And what kind of a story--illustrated story--will it be for the\r\npapers?\" persisted the captain. \"Let him go,\" said the manager; \"but he ought to be whaled.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Dan arrived, accompanied by his wife. \"F'r why sh'u'd he be whaled?\" demanded the latter aggressively. The matter was explained to her. \"Is that thrue, Danny?\" she asked. \"Sure,\" replied the boy. \"Well, I'd like to see anny wan outside the fam'ly whale ye,\" she said,\r\nwith a defiant look at the manager, \"but I'll do it mesilf.\"\r\n\r\nDanny was astounded. In this quarter at least he had expected support.

SIMON STARTS IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nBY J.J. HOOPER\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil Simon entered his seventeenth year he lived with his father, an\r\nold \"hard-shell\" Baptist preacher, who, though very pious and remarkably\r\naustere, was very avaricious. The old man reared his boy--or endeavored\r\nto do so--according to the strictest requisitions of the moral law. But\r\nhe lived, at the time to which we refer, in Middle Georgia, which was\r\nthen newly settled; and Simon, whose wits were always too sharp for his\r\nfather's, contrived to contract all the coarse vices incident to such a\r\nregion. He stole his mother's roosters to fight them at Bob Smith's\r\ngrocery, and his father's plow-horses to enter them in \"quarter\" matches\r\nat the same place. He pitched dollars with Bob Smith himself, and could\r\n\"beat him into doll rags\" whenever it came to a measurement. To crown\r\nhis accomplishments, Simon was tip-top at the game of \"old sledge,\"\r\nwhich was the fashionable game of that era, and was early initiated in\r\nthe mysteries of \"stocking the papers.\" The vicious habits of Simon\r\nwere, of course, a sore trouble to his father, Elder Jedediah. He\r\nreasoned, he counseled, he remonstrated, and he lashed; but Simon was an\r\nincorrigible, irreclaimable devil. One day the simple-minded old man\r\nreturned rather unexpectedly to the field, where he had left Simon and\r\nBen and a negro boy named Bill at work. Ben was still following his\r\nplow, but Simon and Bill were in a fence corner, very earnestly engaged\r\nat \"seven up.\" Of course the game was instantly suspended as soon as\r\nthey spied the old man, sixty or seventy yards off, striding towards\r\nthem. It was evidently a \"gone case\" with Simon and Bill; but our hero\r\ndetermined to make the best of it. Putting the cards into one pocket, he\r\ncoolly picked up the small coins which constituted the stake, and fobbed\r\nthem in the other, remarking, \"Well, Bill, this game's blocked; we'd as\r\nwell quit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mass Simon,\" remarked the boy, \"half dat money's mine.", "sentences": ["\"The idee of breakin'\r\nthe law an' makin' all this throuble.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've done it yourself,\" argued Danny.", "\"Shut up!\" commanded Dan.", "\"Ye don't know what ye're talkin' about.", "A\r\nsthrike's wan thing an' disordherly conduct's another.\"\r\n\r\n\"This was a strike,\" insisted Danny.", "\"Where's the union?\" demanded Dan.", "\"I'm it,\" replied Danny.", "\"I was organizin' it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ye'll let him go, Captain,\" said Dan, ignoring his son's reply,\r\n\"I'll larrup him good.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what?\" wailed Danny.", "\"I was only doin' what you said was right, an'\r\nwhat mom said was right, an' what you've all been talkin' for years.", "You've been a picket yourself, an' I've heard you laughin' over the way\r\nmen who wouldn't strike was done up.", "We got to organize.", "Wasn't I\r\norganizin'?", "We got to enforce our rights.", "Wasn't I enforcin' them?", "We\r\ngot to discourage traitors to the cause of labor.", "Wasn't I discouragin'\r\nthem?", "Didn't the union tie up a plant once when you was discharged?", "What's eatin' you, dad?\"\r\n\r\nDanny's own presentation of the case was so strong that it gave him\r\ncourage.", "But the last question made Dan jump, although he was not\r\naccustomed to any extraordinary show of respect from his son.", "\"The lad has no sinse,\" he announced, \"but I'll larrup him plenty.", "Ye\r\nget an exthry wan f'r that, Danny.", "I'll tache ye that ye're not runnin'\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Makin' throuble f'r father an' mother an' th' good man that's payin' ye\r\nwages we need at home,\" added Mrs.", "Burke.", "\"Now, what do you think of that?\" whimpered Danny, as he was led away.", "\"I'm to be licked fer doin' what he does.", "Why don't he teach himself the\r\nsame, an' stop others from doin' what he talks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Danny,\" said the commiserating captain, \"you're to be licked for\r\nlearning your lesson too well, and that's the truth.\"\r\n\r\nBut that did not make the situation any the less painful for Danny.", "SIMON STARTS IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nBY J.J.", "HOOPER\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil Simon entered his seventeenth year he lived with his father, an\r\nold \"hard-shell\" Baptist preacher, who, though very pious and remarkably\r\naustere, was very avaricious.", "The old man reared his boy--or endeavored\r\nto do so--according to the strictest requisitions of the moral law.", "But\r\nhe lived, at the time to which we refer, in Middle Georgia, which was\r\nthen newly settled; and Simon, whose wits were always too sharp for his\r\nfather's, contrived to contract all the coarse vices incident to such a\r\nregion.", "He stole his mother's roosters to fight them at Bob Smith's\r\ngrocery, and his father's plow-horses to enter them in \"quarter\" matches\r\nat the same place.", "He pitched dollars with Bob Smith himself, and could\r\n\"beat him into doll rags\" whenever it came to a measurement.", "To crown\r\nhis accomplishments, Simon was tip-top at the game of \"old sledge,\"\r\nwhich was the fashionable game of that era, and was early initiated in\r\nthe mysteries of \"stocking the papers.\" The vicious habits of Simon\r\nwere, of course, a sore trouble to his father, Elder Jedediah.", "He\r\nreasoned, he counseled, he remonstrated, and he lashed; but Simon was an\r\nincorrigible, irreclaimable devil.", "One day the simple-minded old man\r\nreturned rather unexpectedly to the field, where he had left Simon and\r\nBen and a negro boy named Bill at work.", "Ben was still following his\r\nplow, but Simon and Bill were in a fence corner, very earnestly engaged\r\nat \"seven up.\" Of course the game was instantly suspended as soon as\r\nthey spied the old man, sixty or seventy yards off, striding towards\r\nthem.", "It was evidently a \"gone case\" with Simon and Bill; but our hero\r\ndetermined to make the best of it.", "Putting the cards into one pocket, he\r\ncoolly picked up the small coins which constituted the stake, and fobbed\r\nthem in the other, remarking, \"Well, Bill, this game's blocked; we'd as\r\nwell quit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mass Simon,\" remarked the boy, \"half dat money's mine."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Unknown Author"}, {"id": "txt_de_19323_32", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Wit and Humor of America, Volume V.

It must not be supposed that, during the walk to the place of\r\npunishment, Simon's mind was either inactive, or engaged in suggesting\r\nthe grimaces and contortions wherewith he was pantomimically expressing\r\nhis irreverent sentiments toward his father. Far from it. The movements\r\nof his limbs and features were the mere workings of habit--the\r\nself-grinding of the corporeal machine--for which his reasoning half was\r\nonly remotely responsible. For while Simon's person was thus, on its own\r\naccount \"making game\" of old Jed'diah, his wits, in view of the\r\nanticipated flogging, were dashing, springing, bounding, darting about,\r\nin hot chase of some expedient suitable to the necessities of the case;\r\nmuch after the manner in which puss--when Betty, armed with the broom,\r\nand hotly seeking vengeance for pantry robbed or bed defiled, has closed\r\nupon her the garret doors and windows--attempts all sorts of impossible\r\nexits, to come down at last in the corner, with panting side and glaring\r\neye, exhausted and defenseless. Our unfortunate hero could devise\r\nnothing by which he could reasonably expect to escape the heavy blows of\r\nhis father. Having arrived at this conclusion and the \"mulberry\" about\r\nthe same time, he stood with a dogged look, awaiting the issue. The old man Suggs made no remark to any one while he was sizing up\r\nBill,--a process which, though by no means novel to Simon, seemed to\r\nexcite in him a sort of painful interest. He watched it closely, as if\r\nendeavoring to learn the precise fashion of his father's knot; and when\r\nat last Bill was swung up a-tiptoe to a limb, and the whipping\r\ncommenced, Simon's eye followed every movement of his father's arm; and\r\nas each blow descended upon the bare shoulders of his sable friend, his\r\nown body writhed and \"wriggled\" in involuntary sympathy. \"It's the devil, it is,\" said Simon to himself, \"to take such a\r\nwallopin' as that.

Give me them fix-ments, Simon.\"\r\n\r\nOur hero handed the cards to his father, who, dropping the plow-line\r\nwith which he had intended to tie Simon's hands, turned his back to that\r\nindividual, in order to prevent his witnessing the operation of\r\n_mixing_. He then sat down, and very leisurely commenced shuffling the\r\ncards, making, however, an exceedingly awkward job of it. Restive\r\n_kings_ and _queens_ jumped from his hands, or obstinately refused to\r\nslide into the company of the rest of the pack. Occasionally a sprightly\r\n_knave_ would insist on _facing_ his neighbor; or, pressing his edge\r\nagainst another's, half double himself up, and then skip away. But Elder\r\nJed'diah perseveringly continued his attempts to subdue the refractory,\r\nwhile heavy drops burst from his forehead, and ran down his cheeks. All\r\nof a sudden an idea, quick and penetrating as a rifle-ball, seemed to\r\nhave entered the cranium of the old man. He chuckled audibly. The devil\r\nhad suggested to Mr. Suggs an _impromptu_ \"stock,\" which would place the\r\nchances of Simon, already sufficiently slim in the old man's opinion,\r\nwithout the range of possibility. Mr. Suggs forthwith proceeded to cut\r\nall the _picter ones_, so as to be certain to include the _Jacks_, and\r\nplace them at the bottom, with the evident intention of keeping Simon's\r\nfingers above these when he should cut. Our hero, who was quietly\r\nlooking over his father's shoulders all the time, did not seem alarmed\r\nby this disposition of the cards; on the contrary, he smiled, as if he\r\nfelt perfectly confident of success, in spite of it. \"Now, daddy,\" said Simon, when his father had announced himself ready,\r\n\"narry one of us ain't got to look at the cards, while I'm a-cuttin'; if\r\nwe do, it'll spile the conjuration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And another thing: you've got to look me right dead in the eye, daddy;\r\nwill you?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,--to be sure,\" said Mr. Suggs; \"fire away.\"\r\n\r\nSimon walked up close to his father, and placed his hand on the pack. Old Mr. Suggs looked in Simon's eye, and Simon returned the look for\r\nabout three seconds, during which a close observer might have detected a\r\nsuspicious working of the wrist of the hand on the cards, but the elder\r\nSuggs did not remark it. \"Wake snakes! day's a-breakin'! Rise, Jack!\" said Simon, cutting half a\r\ndozen cards from the top of the pack, and presenting the face of the\r\nbottom one for the inspection of his father. It was the Jack of hearts! Old Mr. Suggs staggered back several steps, with uplifted eyes and\r\nhands! \"Marciful master!\" he exclaimed, \"ef the boy hain't! Well, how in the\r\nround creation of the--! Ben, did you ever? To be sure and sartain,\r\nSatan has power on this yearth!\" and Mr. Suggs groaned in very\r\nbitterness. \"You never seed nothin' like that in _Augusty_, did ye, daddy?\" asked\r\nSimon, with a malicious wink at Ben. \"Simon, how _did_ you do it?\" queried the old man, without noticing his\r\nson's question. \"Do it, daddy?

That it was a musical instrument made it a rarer\r\nthing in that wild country than if it had been an animal, and people of\r\nall sizes, colors, and degrees were dying to see and hear it. Jim Cash was Mo Mercer's right-hand man: in the language of refined\r\nsociety, he was \"Mo's toady;\" in the language of Hardscrabble, he was\r\n\"Mo's wheel-horse.\" Cash believed in Mo Mercer with an abandonment that\r\nwas perfectly ridiculous. Mr. Cash was dying to see the piano, and the\r\nfirst opportunity he had alone with his Quixote he expressed the desire\r\nthat was consuming his vitals. \"We'll go at once and see it,\" said Mercer. \"Strangers!\" echoed the frightened Cash. \"Humbug! Do you think I have visited the 'Capitol' twice, and don't know\r\nhow to treat fashionable society? Come along at once, Cash,\" said\r\nMercer. Off the pair started, Mercer all confidence, and Cash all fears as to\r\nthe propriety of the visit. These fears Cash frankly expressed; but\r\nMercer repeated for the thousandth time his experience in the\r\nfashionable society of the \"Capitol, and pianos,\" which he said \"was\r\nsynonymous;\" and he finally told Cash, to comfort him, that, however\r\nabashed and ashamed he might be in the presence of the ladies, \"he\r\nneedn't fear of sticking, for he would pull him through.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes' walk brought the parties on the broad galleries of the\r\nhouse that contained the object of so much curiosity. The doors and\r\nwindows were closed, and a suspicious look was on everything. \"Do they always keep a house closed up this way that has a piano in it?\"\r\nasked Cash mysteriously. \"Certainly,\" replied Mercer: \"the damp would destroy its tones.\"\r\n\r\nRepeated knocks at the doors, and finally at the windows, satisfied both\r\nCash and Mercer that nobody was at home. In the midst of their\r\ndisappointment, Cash discovered a singular machine at the end of the\r\ngallery, crossed by bars and rollers and surmounted with an enormous\r\ncrank. Cash approached it on tiptoe; he had a presentiment that he\r\nbeheld the object of his curiosity, and, as its intricate character\r\nunfolded itself, he gazed with distended eyes, and asked Mercer, with\r\nbreathless anxiety, what that strange and incomprehensible box was. Mercer turned to the thing as coolly as a north wind to an icicle, and\r\nsaid, that was _it_. \"That _it_!\" exclaimed Cash, opening his eyes still wider; and then,\r\nrecovering himself, he asked to see \"the tone.\"\r\n\r\nMercer pointed to the cross-bars and rollers.

(Part 42)", "language": "de", "content": "A NIGHT IN A ROCKING-CHAIR\r\n\r\nBY KATE FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be true that America is going to perdition; that all Americans\r\nare rascals; that there are no American gentlemen; that culture,\r\nrefinement, and social manners can only be found in the Old World: but\r\nif it be true, what an extraordinary anomaly it is that women, old and\r\nyoung, ugly and handsome, can travel alone from one end of this great\r\ncountry to the other, receiving only such attention as is acceptable. Having journeyed up and down the land to the extent of twenty thousand\r\nmiles, I am persuaded that a woman can go anywhere and do anything,\r\nprovided she conducts herself properly. Of course it would be absurd to\r\ndeny that it is not infinitely more agreeable to be accompanied by the\r\n\"tyrant\" called \"man\"; but when there is no tyrant to come to lovely\r\nwoman's rescue, it is astonishing how well lovely woman can rescue\r\nherself, if she exerts the brain and muscle, given her thousands of\r\nyears ago, and not entirely annihilated by long disuse. I have been\r\nnowhere that I have not been treated with greater consideration than if\r\nI had belonged to the other sex. There is not a country in Europe of\r\nwhich this can be said; and if a nation's civilization is gauged--as the\r\nwise declare--by its treatment of women, then America, rough as it may\r\nbe, badly dressed as it is, tobacco-chewing as it often is, stands\r\nhead, shoulders, and heart above all the rest of the world. The\r\nFrenchwoman was right in declaring America to be _le paradis des dames_,\r\nand those women who exalt European gallantry above American honesty are\r\nas blind to their own interests as an owl at high noon. There is no royal railroad to lecturing. At best it is hard work, but\r\nlecture committees \"do their possible,\" as the Italians say, to lessen\r\nthe weight, and that \"possible\" is heartily appreciated by such of us as\r\ninwardly long for a natural bridge between stations and hotels. A woman\r\nis never so forlorn as when getting out of a car or entering a strange\r\nhotel. However, there never was a rule without its exception, and though\r\ncourtesy has marked the majority of lecture committees for its own, a\r\nlecturer may occasionally find himself stranded upon a desert of\r\nindifference, and languish for the comforts of a home not twenty miles\r\ndistant. Thus it happened that once upon arriving at my destination when\r\nthe shades of evening were falling fast, and glancing about for the\r\ncustomary smiling gentlemen who smooth out the rough places by carrying\r\nbags, superintending the transportation of luggage, and driving you to\r\nyour abiding-place in the best carriage of the period, I found no\r\ngentlemen, smiling or otherwise, to deliver me from my own ignorance. \"Carriage, ma'am?\" screamed a Jehu in top-boots ornamented with a\r\ngrotesque tracery of mud. Well, yes, I would take a carriage; so up I clambered and sat down upon\r\nwhat in the darkness I supposed was a seat, but what gave such palpable\r\nevidences of animation in howls and attempts at assault and battery, as\r\nto prove its right to be called a boy. \"An' sure the lady didn't mane to\r\nhurt ye, Jimmy,\" expostulated something that turned out to be the boy's\r\nmother, whereupon a baby and a small sister of the small boy sent forth\r\ntheir voices in unison with that of their extinguished brother. \"Driver, let me get out,\" I said pathetically. \"Certainly, ma'am, but where will you go to? There ain't no other\r\ncarriage left.\"\r\n\r\nTrue; and I remained, and when I was asked where I wanted to stop, I\r\nreally did not know. Was there a hotel? Yes. Was there more than one\r\nhotel?

Following him up several steep flights of stairs, lighted by a kerosene\r\nlamp that perfumed the air as only kerosene can, I was at last ushered\r\ninto a room where sat a young girl knitting.

Depositing the package upon a hall table, he called to his\r\nson in a mandatory manner:\r\n\r\n\"Rollo, come to me.\"\r\n\r\nRollo approached, but started with reluctant steps. He became\r\nreminiscently aware as he hastily reviewed the events of the day, that\r\nin carrying out one or two measures for the good of the house, he had\r\nlaid himself open to an investigation by a strictly partisan committee,\r\nand the possibility of such an inquiry, with its subsequent report,\r\ngrieved him. However, he hoped for the worst, so that in any event he\r\nwould not be disagreeably disappointed, and came running to his father,\r\ncalling \"Yes, sir!\" in his cheeriest tones. This is the correct form in which to meet any possible adversity which\r\nis not yet in sight. Because, if it should not meet you, you are happy\r\nanyhow, and if it should meet you, you have been happy before the\r\ncollision. See? \"Now, Rollo,\" said his father, \"you are too large and strong to be\r\nspending your leisure time playing baby games with your little brother\r\nThanny. It is time for you to begin to be athletic.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is athletic?\" asked Rollo. \"Well,\" replied his father, who was an alumnus (pronounced ahloomnoose)\r\nhimself, \"in a general way it means to wear a pair of pantaloons either\r\neighteen inches too short or six inches too long for you, and stand\r\naround and yell while other men do your playing for you. The reputation\r\nfor being an athlete may also be acquired by wearing a golf suit to\r\nchurch, or carrying a tennis racket to your meals. However, as I was\r\nabout to say, I do not wish you to work all the time, like a woman, or\r\neven a small part of the time, like a hired man. I wish you to adopt for\r\nyour recreation games of sport and pastime.\"\r\n\r\nRollo interrupted his father to say that indeed he preferred games of\r\nthat description to games of toil and labor, but as he concluded, little\r\nThanny, who was sitting on the porch step with his book, suddenly read\r\naloud, in a staccato measure. \"I-be-lieve-you-my-boy,-re-plied-the-man-heart-i-ly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read to yourself, Thanny,\" said his father kindly, \"and do not speak\r\nyour syllables in that jerky manner.\"\r\n\r\nThanny subsided into silence, after making two or three strange gurgling\r\nnoises in his throat, which Rollo, after several efforts, succeeded in\r\nimitating quite well. Being older than Thanny, Rollo, of course, could\r\nnot invent so many new noises every day as his little brother. But he\r\ncould take Thanny's noises, they being unprotected by copyright, and not\r\nonly reproduce them, but even improve upon them. This shows the advantage of the higher education. \"A little learning is\r\na dangerous thing.\" It is well for every boy to learn that dynamite is\r\nan explosive of great power, after which it is still better for him to\r\nlearn of how great power.

We tossed up a bat--wet or\r\ndry--for first choice, and then chose the whole school on the sides. The\r\nbat was a board, about the general shape of a Roman galley oar and not\r\nquite so wide as a barn door. The ball was of solid India rubber; a\r\nlittle fellow could hit it a hundred yards, and a big boy, with a\r\nhickory club, could send it clear over the bluffs or across the lake. We\r\nbroke all the windows in the school-house the first day, and finished up\r\nevery pane of glass in the neighborhood before the season closed.

Aunt 'Phrony, she told them, had promised to come and look\r\nafter them during her absence. \"Oh, please, mamma,\" they begged, \"let Aunt 'Phrony take us nutting? She\r\ntold us one day that she knew where there were just lots and lots of\r\nwalnuts.\" So it was arranged that they should take a luncheon with them\r\nand make a day of it, Aunt 'Phrony being perfectly willing, for her\r\nIndian blood showed itself not only in her appearance, but in her love\r\nfor a free out-of-door life, and her fondness for tramping. She would\r\nreadily give up a day's work at any time to discharge some wholly\r\ninsignificant errand which involved a walk of many miles. The day was a bright and beautiful one in October, warm, yet with a\r\nfaint nip of last night's frost lingering in the air. They made a fine\r\nlittle procession through the woods, Aunt 'Phrony leading, followed by\r\nchildren, a darky with baskets, her grandson \"Wi'yum,\" and lastly the\r\ndogs, frisking and frolicking and darting away every now and then in\r\npursuit of small game. A very weary and hungry little party gathered\r\nabout the baskets at one o'clock, and three little pairs of white hands\r\nwere stained almost as brown as those of Aunt 'Phrony and William. But\r\neverybody was happy, and there was a nice pile of walnuts to go back in\r\nthe large bag which William had brought for the purpose. The dogs sat\r\naround and looked longingly on, a squirrel frisked hastily across a log\r\nnear-by, the birds chattered in the trees high above and looked\r\ncuriously down on the intruders, and presently a foolish hare went\r\nscurrying across the path, so near the dogs that they sat still, amazed\r\nat his presumption, and forbore to chase him. \"Hi! there goes 'ol' Hyar'!'\" shouted Ned; \"I'm going to see if I can't\r\ncatch him.\" But he soon gave up the hopeless chase. \"Was that your 'ol' Hyar',' Aunt 'Phrony; your ol' Hyar' you tell us all\r\nabout?\" asked little Kit. \"Bless de chil'!\" said she. \"Naw, 'twuz de ol', ol' Hyar' I done tol'\r\nyou 'bout, de gre't-gre't-gre't-sump'n-ru'rr grandaddy er dis one, I\r\nreckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aunt 'Phrony,\" said Janey, \"couldn't you tell us some more about the\r\nold hare while we sit here and get rested?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now de laws-a-mussy,\" said 'Phrony, \"ef we gwine 'mence on de ol' tales\r\nI reckon I mought ez well mek up my min' ter spen' de res' er de day\r\nright yer on dis spot,\" and she leaned back against a pine tree and\r\nclosed her eyes resignedly.

Even this had a drawback. He glanced up again, with a puzzled frown, at\r\nthe queer sign glaring down at him from the hedge. It was the third one\r\nof the sort in the past quarter of a mile:\r\n\r\n     _TRESPASSERS_\r\n\r\n     _Are warned from these premises\r\n     under penalty of the law_\r\n\r\n     _ESPECIALLY MEN_\r\n\r\nHe turned away impatiently. Dust, dust, dust! He could feel it pasty on\r\nhis tongue, gritty on his lips, grimy on his face. It had stiffened his\r\nhair, clogged his nostrils, sifted through his clothing, settled into\r\nhis shoes. It was everywhere and all-pervading. The forbidden creek, in the very refinement of derision, suddenly\r\nbubbled into a bar of clinking song--a perfect ecstasy of crystal\r\nnotes--then as suddenly died down, babbling and gurgling, and flowed\r\nsmoothly on, whispering and murmuring to itself of the delights to come\r\nin the heart of the cool woods. Just here, with a swift sweep between\r\nmossy, curved banks, the stream turned its back to him and hurried away\r\namong the trees with a coy invitation that was well-nigh maddening. He\r\nremembered just such a creek as that where, as a boy, he had used to go\r\nwith his companions after school. How delightful those boyish swims had been! In fancy he could still feel\r\nthe chill shock as he had plunged in, the sharp catching of his breath,\r\nthe resounding splash, the shower of icy drops, the soft yielding of the\r\nwater--then the delicious buoyancy that had pervaded his limbs. He\r\nwondered, with a whimsical smile, how long he could \"stay under,\" and if\r\nhe could hold his eyes open while he dived, and if he could still swim\r\n\"dog fashion\" and back-handed on his back, and if he could float and\r\ntread water and \"turtle.\"\r\n\r\nHow cool and shady and restful it looked in there! Just before the creek\r\nturned behind a clump of dogwood, a patch of sunlight lay on it,\r\nshooting down through the misty twilight of broad oak trees, and the\r\nsurface of the water dimpled and glinted and laughed and flirted at him,\r\nbefore it slipped away into leaf-dimmed sylvan solitudes, in a way that\r\nwas not to be longer resisted. He gave one more glance of distaste at\r\nthe white hot road and gave up the struggle. \"Here goes the 'especial man,'\" he said, looking up at the sign in\r\nsmiling defiance, and forced his way through the hedge. What a coquettish little stream that was! It leaped merrily down tiny,\r\nboulder-strewn inclines to show him how light-hearted and care-free it\r\ncould be; it flowed sedately between narrow banks of turf to display its\r\nperfect propriety; it coyly hid behind walls of graceful, slender\r\nwillows; it danced impudently into the open and dashed across clear\r\nspaces in frantic haste to escape him; it spread out, clear and limpid,\r\nupon little bars of golden sand, pretending frankly to reveal its pure,\r\ninmost depths; then raced on again, ever beckoning, ever enticing, ever\r\ncajoling, until at last it plunged straight at a wall of dense, tangled\r\nunderbrush, and, with a vixenish gurgle of delight at its own\r\nblandishing duplicity, vanished underneath the low sweeping mass of\r\nleaves without even so much as a good-by! The pursuer was not to be daunted. Doggedly he fought his way around and\r\nthrough the swampy underbrush and presently stood blinking his delighted\r\neyes in a little natural clearing that was a glorious climax to all the\r\ntantalizing coquetry of the creek. Encircled by drooping, long-leaved\r\nwillows that were themselves enringed by stately trees, lay a broad,\r\ndeep pool, clear as crystal, one side carpeted with velvety turf and\r\nscreened with leafy draperies, and the whole canopied by the smiling\r\nblue sky.", "sentences": ["Rather than spend the\r\nday in that dismal abode of Puritanism he had fled on foot, his business\r\ndone, and this little creek, mocking, alluring, irresistible, was the\r\nonly cheerful thing on which his eyes had rested in that whole stifling\r\njourney.", "Even this had a drawback.", "He glanced up again, with a puzzled frown, at\r\nthe queer sign glaring down at him from the hedge.", "It was the third one\r\nof the sort in the past quarter of a mile:\r\n\r\n     _TRESPASSERS_\r\n\r\n     _Are warned from these premises\r\n     under penalty of the law_\r\n\r\n     _ESPECIALLY MEN_\r\n\r\nHe turned away impatiently.", "Dust, dust, dust!", "He could feel it pasty on\r\nhis tongue, gritty on his lips, grimy on his face.", "It had stiffened his\r\nhair, clogged his nostrils, sifted through his clothing, settled into\r\nhis shoes.", "It was everywhere and all-pervading.", "The forbidden creek, in the very refinement of derision, suddenly\r\nbubbled into a bar of clinking song--a perfect ecstasy of crystal\r\nnotes--then as suddenly died down, babbling and gurgling, and flowed\r\nsmoothly on, whispering and murmuring to itself of the delights to come\r\nin the heart of the cool woods.", "Just here, with a swift sweep between\r\nmossy, curved banks, the stream turned its back to him and hurried away\r\namong the trees with a coy invitation that was well-nigh maddening.", "He\r\nremembered just such a creek as that where, as a boy, he had used to go\r\nwith his companions after school.", "How delightful those boyish swims had been!", "In fancy he could still feel\r\nthe chill shock as he had plunged in, the sharp catching of his breath,\r\nthe resounding splash, the shower of icy drops, the soft yielding of the\r\nwater--then the delicious buoyancy that had pervaded his limbs.", "He\r\nwondered, with a whimsical smile, how long he could \"stay under,\" and if\r\nhe could hold his eyes open while he dived, and if he could still swim\r\n\"dog fashion\" and back-handed on his back, and if he could float and\r\ntread water and \"turtle.\"\r\n\r\nHow cool and shady and restful it looked in there!", "Just before the creek\r\nturned behind a clump of dogwood, a patch of sunlight lay on it,\r\nshooting down through the misty twilight of broad oak trees, and the\r\nsurface of the water dimpled and glinted and laughed and flirted at him,\r\nbefore it slipped away into leaf-dimmed sylvan solitudes, in a way that\r\nwas not to be longer resisted.", "He gave one more glance of distaste at\r\nthe white hot road and gave up the struggle.", "\"Here goes the 'especial man,'\" he said, looking up at the sign in\r\nsmiling defiance, and forced his way through the hedge.", "What a coquettish little stream that was!", "It leaped merrily down tiny,\r\nboulder-strewn inclines to show him how light-hearted and care-free it\r\ncould be; it flowed sedately between narrow banks of turf to display its\r\nperfect propriety; it coyly hid behind walls of graceful, slender\r\nwillows; it danced impudently into the open and dashed across clear\r\nspaces in frantic haste to escape him; it spread out, clear and limpid,\r\nupon little bars of golden sand, pretending frankly to reveal its pure,\r\ninmost depths; then raced on again, ever beckoning, ever enticing, ever\r\ncajoling, until at last it plunged straight at a wall of dense, tangled\r\nunderbrush, and, with a vixenish gurgle of delight at its own\r\nblandishing duplicity, vanished underneath the low sweeping mass of\r\nleaves without even so much as a good-by!", "The pursuer was not to be daunted.", "Doggedly he fought his way around and\r\nthrough the swampy underbrush and presently stood blinking his delighted\r\neyes in a little natural clearing that was a glorious climax to all the\r\ntantalizing coquetry of the creek.", "Encircled by drooping, long-leaved\r\nwillows that were themselves enringed by stately trees, lay a broad,\r\ndeep pool, clear as crystal, one side carpeted with velvety turf and\r\nscreened with leafy draperies, and the whole canopied by the smiling\r\nblue sky."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Unknown Author"}, {"id": "txt_de_19323_56", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Wit and Humor of America, Volume V. (of X.) (Part 56)", "language": "de", "content": "With a cry of pleasure the young man hastily threw off his\r\nclothing, and, as he undressed, a school-boy taunt whimsically recurred\r\nto him. \"Last one in's a nigger!\" he shouted to the squirrel that he caught\r\npeering at him from the far side of a limb, and plunged into the pool. One by one he gleefully tried all the old boyish tricks until at last,\r\ntiring of them, he lay floating peacefully on his back, looking up at\r\nthe sky and covering the entire visible surface of it with air castles,\r\nas young men will. There was no dusty road, no broiling hot sun, no six\r\nmiles of weary distance yet to cover. There was a rustle and a patter among the trees. Two dogs came bounding\r\nto the edge of the water and barked at the bather in friendly fashion. They were bouncing big St. Bernards, but scarcely more than puppies, and\r\nthey capered and danced in awkward delight when he splashed water at\r\nthem. As a further evidence of their friendly feeling they suddenly\r\npounced upon his clothing. \"Hey there!\" cried the bather, and scrambled out to rescue his apparel. It was kind of him, the dogs thought, to take so much interest in the\r\ngame, and, not to be outdone in heartiness, they scampered off through\r\nthe woods, taking the clothes with them. All they left behind was his\r\nhat, his shoes and one sock, his collar and cuffs and tie. He threw\r\nsticks and stones after them and had started to chase them when a new\r\nand dreadful sound smote on his ear. It was the voices of women! There was but one safe hiding-place--the pool. With rare presence of\r\nmind he concealed the pathetic remnant of his belongings and plunged\r\njust in time, diving under a clump of low-hanging willows where a\r\nfriendly root gave support to his arms and breast. Two elderly ladies of severe and forbidding aspect came slowly within\r\nhis range of vision. One was tall and thin and the other was short and\r\nthin, while both wore plain, skimp, black gowns and had their hair\r\nparted in the center and smoothed down flatly over their ears. They were\r\nsilent with some vexed and weighty problem as they drew near, but, as\r\nthey came just opposite to him, the taller of the two suddenly burst out\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n\"Men, men, men! Nothing but men, morning, noon and night. Please\r\nexplain, Sister Ann! Where did Adnah, during my brief absence, get her\r\nsudden curiosity about the despicable sex?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the recent visit of Doctor Laura Phelps, Sister Sarah,\" meekly\r\nreplied the smaller woman. \"She lost a magazine while here and Adnah\r\nfound it. The publication contained several love stories, so-called, an\r\nillustrated article on 'Young Captains of Industry' and another on\r\n'Handsome Young Men of the Stage.' I burned the pernicious thing as soon\r\nas it came into my hands, but, alas, the damage had been done!\"\r\n\r\n\"Damage, indeed, Sister Ann!\" snapped the other. \"Since the age of five,\r\npoor Sister Jane's orphan has never been permitted to see a man.

Just wait, Aunt Mattie, until\r\nI run for the bathing suits,\" and she flashed away again. Great Caesar's ghost! The hidden youth grew so warm with apprehension\r\nthat the goose-flesh disappeared and the chattering of his teeth\r\nstopped. His dilemma was unspeakable and unsolvable, seemingly, but\r\nsuddenly it was solved for him. The dogs came back! The sock had been shredded and they sought fresh diversion. After a\r\ncordially barked invitation for the young man to come out and play, they\r\nwent in after him. There was a tremendous splashing struggle. Suddenly\r\nthe willows were pulled down by a muscular bare arm, and the face of a\r\nyoung man appeared above it to the astounded gaze of Aunt Matilda. \"Excuse me, madam,\" he began, lunging viciously at Castor and Pollux\r\nwith his feet. \"Please call off your dogs.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Matilda, pale but determined, whipped an antiquated monster of a\r\npistol from her pocket, though she held it far off from her and to one\r\nside, with no intention, past, present or future, of ever firing it. It\r\ngot its effectiveness from size alone, and was built for pure moral\r\nsuasion if ever a pistol was. \"Hold perfectly still or I shall shoot,\" she quaveringly warned him. \"You are a male trespasser, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"I sincerely regret it, madam,\" replied the culprit, slapping viciously\r\nat the mosquito behind his ear. He got it that time. \"You probably will,\" freezingly retorted Aunt Matilda. \"I shall\r\ntelephone for the sheriff immediately, and if you are still here when he\r\narrives you shall receive the full penalty of the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man did some quick thinking. It was necessary. \"Madam, your dogs have stolen my clothing and my money, and I can not\r\nleave until I get them back,\" he presently declared with lucky\r\ninspiration. \"If you have me arrested for trespass I shall bring suit\r\nfor the recovery of property.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Matilda was sufficiently perplexed to lower her pistol and allow\r\nhim to explain, while she coaxed the dogs out of the water. He was a\r\nsplendid talker, and had fine, honest-looking blue eyes. There was a rush of swift footsteps among the trees. \"Hide!\" she commanded in sudden panic. He promptly hid, and when Adnah arrived with the bathing suits, that\r\nyoung lady found her aunt calmly seated on the ground, holding Castor\r\nand Pollux each by a dripping collar. \"Leave my suit and return to the house at once with these dogs,\"\r\ndirected Aunt Matilda without turning her head. \"Why, Aunt Mattie, what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\" snapped Aunt Matilda in desperation. \"Go back to the house\r\nand stay until I come. Ask no questions.\"\r\n\r\nAdnah searched the scene in mystification for a moment. \"Yes, aunty,\" she suddenly said, and walked away in a flutter of\r\nexcitement. She had caught the gleam of a bright eye peering at her from\r\namong the willows! She burst into a spontaneous rhapsody of song as she went, trilling and\r\nwarbling in sweet, untaught cadences, unconsciously like a bird singing\r\nto its mate in the springtime. She had a wonderful voice. The young man\r\nwas sorry when she was out of hearing, but glad, too, for the water was\r\nbeginning to pucker his cuticle in hard ridges like a wash-board. \"Now, young man,\" said Aunt Matilda, \"I shall leave this bathing suit\r\nhere for your use. I shall expect you to put it on and retire from the\r\npremises as quickly as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must remain until nightfall,\" was the firm reply. \"I must find my\r\nmoney and clothes. I should feel ridiculous to be seen in such clothing\r\nas that.

The young man lost no time in getting into that bathing suit, for the\r\nchill of the water was upon him. The suit consisted merely of a pair of\r\nblue bloomers that came just below his knees, and a blue blouse that\r\nsplit down the back and at the armpits the moment he buttoned it in\r\nfront; still he was very grateful for it--grateful for the warm glow\r\nthat began to pervade him the moment he had donned it. He put on his one\r\nsock and his shoes, his hat, collar, tie and cuffs to keep the dogs from\r\ngetting them, and was quite comfortable when Aunt Matilda came bustling\r\nback with a bowl of steaming tea and a tray loaded with good things to\r\neat. She sat by admiring his appetite until he had finished, then she made\r\nhim drink the boneset tea to the last drop. He talked admirably all\r\nthrough the \"dinner,\" and it was with a sigh of almost regret that she\r\nstarted away with the empty dishes. She came back presently. \"You will find our summer cottage up in that direction,\" she pointed\r\nout. \"We shall expect you to--to keep out of range during the day, but\r\nto report at the kitchen door at dusk, when you will be escorted to the\r\nroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall follow your instructions to the letter,\" he assured her, and\r\nshe again slowly walked away. To save her, the man-hater could not think\r\nof another reasonable excuse for prolonging the interview. He was a most\r\ngentlemanly young man, and he had splendid eyes! The male trespasser spent the next hour in hunting clothes and\r\nanathematizing dogs. His finds were confined strictly to rags and\r\npairless arms and sleeves, and finally he gave up, with everything\r\naccounted for but worthless. Discovering a high, grassy plot near the\r\ncreek, screened from the woods by a thick copse of hazel bushes, he lay\r\ndown to think matters over and promptly fell asleep. Perhaps half an hour later he slowly opened his eyes with the feeling\r\nthat he was being compelled to awaken, and found Adnah seated quietly\r\nbeside him, keeping the mosquitoes away from him with a gracefully waved\r\nhazel branch. \"Just sleep right on,\" she gently urged. \"I often sleep for hours on hot\r\nafternoons in this very place.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you come here?\" he demanded, sitting up, startled. \"I hunted you,\" she confessed with a delighted little laugh. \"I'm so\r\nglad you're awake at last and don't want to sleep any more. I felt just\r\nsure that your eyes were blue. And they are!\"\r\n\r\nHer delight at this fact was so obvious that he felt uneasy. \"You see, I listened outside the window while Aunt Mattie told Aunts Ann\r\nand Sarah all about you,\" she confidingly went on. \"Aunt Sarah and Aunt\r\nAnn were for telephoning for the sheriff anyhow, but Aunt Mattie\r\nwouldn't let them. She likes you. So do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said the astonished young man. For the first time in his life\r\nconversation had failed him. \"Of course,\" said the girl simply. \"Well, I waited until they all lay\r\ndown for their after-dinner naps, and climbed out of my window so as not\r\nto disturb them. They do enjoy their naps so much, you know. I didn't\r\nfind you at the pool but I just hunted until I did find you. I've been\r\nsitting here a long time watching you. You look so nice when you are\r\nasleep.\"\r\n\r\n_Now_ what should he say? With any ordinary girl he could have found\r\nthe answer, but this one had him floored. \"But you look ever so much nicer when you are awake,\" she further\r\ninformed him, with a clear-eyed straightforwardness that was worse than\r\ndisconcerting. In desperation he answered, with her own frankness, that\r\nshe was nice looking herself. He meant it, too. \"I'm so glad you think so,\" she contentedly sighed. \"I just knew we\r\nshould like each other as soon as I saw you lying there asleep.\"\r\n\r\nIt was he who blushed, not the girl.

She looked up at him in peaceful happiness and he\r\nsomehow felt very mean and unworthy. Her eyes made him uncomfortable. The whole trouble was that she was so honest--had never been taught to\r\nconceal her thoughts by the thousand and one spoken and unspoken lies of\r\nordinary social intercourse. She was neither timid nor bold, but merely\r\nnatural, with never a suspicion that conventionality demanded a man and\r\na maid to leave a mutual liking unconfessed. It was rather rough on the\r\nyoung man. He was not used to having the truth fly around in such\r\nreckless fashion in his conversations with girls, and it bothered him. \"I'm not a bit afraid of you,\" she presently told him. \"I knew all the\r\ntime that Aunt Mattie was wrong. She told me that all men were dreadful,\r\nand that the first thing they did was to--to kiss a girl they liked.\"\r\n\r\n\"She knows nothing about it,\" he replied rather crossly. For some\r\nunaccountable reason he was angry with himself and with her. \"Indeed, she doesn't,\" she agreed, eying him thoughtfully. Presently she\r\nadded: \"I do not believe, though, that I should have minded it so much\r\nif she had been right.\"\r\n\r\nShade of Plato! He looked down at the tempting curve of her red lips. They were round and full and soft as the petals of a half-blown rosebud,\r\nwarm and tender and sweet, with just the least trace of puckering to\r\nindicate how they could meet the pressure of other lips. He felt his\r\nheart come pounding up into the region of his Adam's apple, and he\r\ntrembled as he had not done since his first attack of puppy love at the\r\nage of fourteen. His breath came and went with a painful flutter but he\r\nmade no movement. If it had been any sort of a girl under the sun,\r\nespecially if so attractive as this one, she would have been kissed\r\nuntil she gasped for breath; but he just couldn't do it. However, if she\r\nwent so far as to _ask_ him to kiss her, _by George_! he didn't see how\r\nhe was to get out of it! \"I should really like to kiss you,\" he admitted with a martyr-like sigh\r\nand a further echo of her own frankness, \"but I shan't. Under the\r\ncircumstances it would not be right.\"\r\n\r\nHe reflected, grinning, that mother would be proud if she could see him\r\nnow, then he thought, grinning harder, of the boys at the club. If\r\n_they_ only knew! \"There, didn't I say so!\" she triumphantly exclaimed. \"I told Aunt\r\nMatilda that there certainly must be _some_ good men in the world!\"\r\n\r\nGood! He winced as certain memories of his careless youth began to do\r\ncake-walks up and down his conscience. Then he changed the subject. She snuggled up closely to him, by and by, confidingly and unsuspicious,\r\nand just talked and talked and talked. It was very pleasant to have her\r\nthere at his side, babbling innocently away in that sweet, musical\r\nvoice. How pretty she was, how artless and trusting, how honest and how\r\nheart-whole! It came to him that his family and friends had for a long\r\ntime been telling him that he ought to get married, and he began to see\r\nthat they were right. How delightful it would be to stay on forever in this enchanted grove\r\nwith her. He presently found himself fervently saying it, though he had\r\nnot intended such words to pass his lips. She took the wish as a matter\r\nof course. She had confidently expected him to feel that way about it,\r\nand, if he felt that way, to say so. \"Adnah Eggleson!\"\r\n\r\nThey jumped like juvenile jam-thieves caught red-handed. Aunt Sarah and Aunt Ann and Aunt Matilda rigidly confronted them, having\r\nstolen upon them unseen, unheard, unthought of, and they stood now in\r\ngrim horror, merciless and implacable. They advanced in a swooping body,\r\nafter one moment of agonizing suspense, and snatched Adnah into their\r\nmidst, glaring three kinds of loathing scorn upon the interloping\r\nserpent. \"Has this person _kissed_ you, or attempted to do so?\" hissed Aunt\r\nSarah.", "sentences": ["An electric\r\nthrill ran through him and tingled out at his fingertips, but he never\r\nmoved a muscle.", "She looked up at him in peaceful happiness and he\r\nsomehow felt very mean and unworthy.", "Her eyes made him uncomfortable.", "The whole trouble was that she was so honest--had never been taught to\r\nconceal her thoughts by the thousand and one spoken and unspoken lies of\r\nordinary social intercourse.", "She was neither timid nor bold, but merely\r\nnatural, with never a suspicion that conventionality demanded a man and\r\na maid to leave a mutual liking unconfessed.", "It was rather rough on the\r\nyoung man.", "He was not used to having the truth fly around in such\r\nreckless fashion in his conversations with girls, and it bothered him.", "\"I'm not a bit afraid of you,\" she presently told him.", "\"I knew all the\r\ntime that Aunt Mattie was wrong.", "She told me that all men were dreadful,\r\nand that the first thing they did was to--to kiss a girl they liked.\"\r\n\r\n\"She knows nothing about it,\" he replied rather crossly.", "For some\r\nunaccountable reason he was angry with himself and with her.", "\"Indeed, she doesn't,\" she agreed, eying him thoughtfully.", "Presently she\r\nadded: \"I do not believe, though, that I should have minded it so much\r\nif she had been right.\"\r\n\r\nShade of Plato!", "He looked down at the tempting curve of her red lips.", "They were round and full and soft as the petals of a half-blown rosebud,\r\nwarm and tender and sweet, with just the least trace of puckering to\r\nindicate how they could meet the pressure of other lips.", "He felt his\r\nheart come pounding up into the region of his Adam's apple, and he\r\ntrembled as he had not done since his first attack of puppy love at the\r\nage of fourteen.", "His breath came and went with a painful flutter but he\r\nmade no movement.", "If it had been any sort of a girl under the sun,\r\nespecially if so attractive as this one, she would have been kissed\r\nuntil she gasped for breath; but he just couldn't do it.", "However, if she\r\nwent so far as to _ask_ him to kiss her, _by George_!", "he didn't see how\r\nhe was to get out of it!", "\"I should really like to kiss you,\" he admitted with a martyr-like sigh\r\nand a further echo of her own frankness, \"but I shan't.", "Under the\r\ncircumstances it would not be right.\"\r\n\r\nHe reflected, grinning, that mother would be proud if she could see him\r\nnow, then he thought, grinning harder, of the boys at the club.", "If\r\n_they_ only knew!", "\"There, didn't I say so!\" she triumphantly exclaimed.", "\"I told Aunt\r\nMatilda that there certainly must be _some_ good men in the world!\"\r\n\r\nGood!", "He winced as certain memories of his careless youth began to do\r\ncake-walks up and down his conscience.", "Then he changed the subject.", "She snuggled up closely to him, by and by, confidingly and unsuspicious,\r\nand just talked and talked and talked.", "It was very pleasant to have her\r\nthere at his side, babbling innocently away in that sweet, musical\r\nvoice.", "How pretty she was, how artless and trusting, how honest and how\r\nheart-whole!", "It came to him that his family and friends had for a long\r\ntime been telling him that he ought to get married, and he began to see\r\nthat they were right.", "How delightful it would be to stay on forever in this enchanted grove\r\nwith her.", "He presently found himself fervently saying it, though he had\r\nnot intended such words to pass his lips.", "She took the wish as a matter\r\nof course.", "She had confidently expected him to feel that way about it,\r\nand, if he felt that way, to say so.", "\"Adnah Eggleson!\"\r\n\r\nThey jumped like juvenile jam-thieves caught red-handed.", "Aunt Sarah and Aunt Ann and Aunt Matilda rigidly confronted them, having\r\nstolen upon them unseen, unheard, unthought of, and they stood now in\r\ngrim horror, merciless and implacable.", "They advanced in a swooping body,\r\nafter one moment of agonizing suspense, and snatched Adnah into their\r\nmidst, glaring three kinds of loathing scorn upon the interloping\r\nserpent.", "\"Has this person _kissed_ you, or attempted to do so?\" hissed Aunt\r\nSarah."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Unknown Author"}, {"id": "txt_de_19323_62", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Wit and Humor of America, Volume V.

Left to himself the serpent moodily kicked holes in the turf. He had an\r\nintense desire to do something violent--to smash something, no matter\r\nwhat. He was furious with the trio of aunts. It was a shame, he told\r\nhimself, to bury alive a beautiful and noble young woman like that,\r\nthrough a warped and mistaken notion of the world. What right had they\r\nto condemn a sweet and affectionate creature such as she to a starved\r\nand morbid spinsterhood? It was his duty to rescue her from the\r\ncolorless fate that hung over her, and he would do his duty. He was\r\nunconsciously flexing his biceps as he said it. Would he? How? Should he get out a search warrant or a writ of replevin? This whimsical view of the case only exasperated him the more as it\r\npresented the utter hopelessness of approaching her--of ever seeing her\r\nagain--and, when the dogs came chasing an utterly inconsequential and\r\nuseless butterfly in his direction, he pelted them with stones until\r\nthey yelped. Hang the dogs, anyhow. It was all their fault! Next he blamed himself. If he had only resisted that creek like a man he\r\nwouldn't have been a hundred miles from home without clothes or money,\r\nand silly about a girl he had never seen until that day. Then he blamed the girl. Why, _why_ was she such a confiding and\r\naltogether artless and bewitching little fool? She wasn't! He remembered\r\nher eyes and abjectly apologized to the memory of her. She was\r\neverything that was sweet and pure and womanly--everything that was\r\ndesirable in every sense--well-bred, well-schooled, unspoiled of the\r\nworld, without guile or subterfuge, beautiful, healthy, honest. That had\r\nbeen the only startling thing about her--just honesty. It spoke ill for\r\nhimself and the world in which he lived that this should have seemed\r\nstartling! What a wonderful creature she was! By the Eternal, she\r\nbelonged to him and he meant to have her! She loved him, too! He sat down on the bank to think over this phase of the question. He had\r\nknown her several years in the minute and a half since noon, and it was\r\ntime this foolishness came to an end. Time flies when youth listens to the fancied strains of Mendelssohn's\r\nSpring Song. He was surprised, presently, to note a strange hush\r\nsettling down over the woods. A chill vapor seemed to arise from the\r\nwater. There was a melancholy note in the tweet of the low-flitting\r\nbirds. The rustling trees softened their murmur to a continuous whisper,\r\nsoothing and caressing. The tinkle of the creek became more metallic and\r\npronounced. Near by, down the stream, a sudden chorus of frogs burst\r\ninto croaking, their isolated notes blended by the chirping undertone of\r\nthe crickets and tree toads. There were other sounds, mysterious,\r\nuntraceable, but all musical in greater or lesser degree. He understood at last. These sounds, the rustling leaves, the flitting\r\nbirds, the tinkling creek, the frogs, tree toads and crickets and those\r\nother intangible cadences, these were the instruments of nature's vast\r\norchestra, playing their lullaby, languorous and sweet, for the drowsy\r\nday.

A LETTER FROM A SELF-MADE MERCHANT TO HIS SON\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE HORACE LORIMER\r\n\r\n\r\n[From John Graham, at the London House of Graham & Co., to his son,\r\nPierrepont, at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago. Mr. Pierrepont is\r\nworried over rumors that the old man is a bear on lard, and that the\r\nlongs are about to make him climb a tree.]\r\n\r\nLONDON, October 27, 189-\r\n\r\n_Dear Pierrepont:_ Yours of the twenty-first inst. to hand and I note\r\nthe inclosed clippings. You needn't pay any special attention to this\r\nnewspaper talk about the Comstock crowd having caught me short a big\r\nline of November lard. I never sell goods without knowing where I can\r\nfind them when I want them, and if these fellows try to put their\r\nforefeet in the trough, or start any shoving and crowding, they're going\r\nto find me forgetting my table manners, too. For when it comes to funny\r\nbusiness I'm something of a humorist myself. And while I'm too old to\r\nrun, I'm young enough to stand and fight. First and last, a good many men have gone gunning for me, but they've\r\nalways planned the obsequies before they caught the deceased. I reckon\r\nthere hasn't been a time in twenty years when there wasn't a nice \"Gates\r\nAjar\" piece all made up and ready for me in some office near the Board\r\nof Trade. But the first essential of a quiet funeral is a willing\r\ncorpse. And I'm still sitting up and taking nourishment. There are two things you never want to pay any attention to--abuse and\r\nflattery. The first can't harm you and the second can't help you. Some\r\nmen are like yellow dogs--when you're coming toward them they'll jump up\r\nand try to lick your hands; and when you're walking away from them\r\nthey'll sneak up behind and snap at your heels. Last year, when I was\r\nbulling the market, the longs all said that I was a kindhearted old\r\nphilanthropist, who was laying awake nights scheming to get the farmers\r\na top price for their hogs; and the shorts allowed that I was an\r\ninfamous old robber, who was stealing the pork out of the workingman's\r\npot. As long as you can't please both sides in this world, there's\r\nnothing like pleasing your own side. There are mighty few people who can see any side to a thing except their\r\nown side. I remember once I had a vacant lot out on the Avenue, and a\r\nlady came in to my office and in a soothing-sirupy way asked if I would\r\nlend it to her, as she wanted to build a _creche_ on it. I hesitated a\r\nlittle, because I had never heard of a _creche_ before, and someways it\r\nsounded sort of foreign and frisky, though the woman looked like a good,\r\nsafe, reliable old heifer. But she explained that a _creche_ was a baby\r\nfarm, where old maids went to wash and feed and stick pins in other\r\npeople's children while their mothers were off at work. Of course, there\r\nwas nothing in that to get our pastor or the police after me, so I told\r\nher to go ahead. She went off happy, but about a week later she dropped in again,\r\nlooking sort of dissatisfied, to find out if I wouldn't build the\r\n_creche_ itself. It seemed like a worthy object, so I sent some\r\ncarpenters over to knock together a long frame pavilion. She was mighty\r\ngrateful, you bet, and I didn't see her again for a fortnight.

There was a sixty-foot frontage of that shed on the\r\nAvenue, and I saw right off that it was just a natural signboard. So I\r\ncalled over the boss painter and between us we cooked up a nice little\r\nad that ran something like this:\r\n\r\n     Graham's Extract:\r\n     It Makes the Weak Strong. Well, sir, when she saw the ad next morning that old hen just\r\nscratched gravel. Went all around town saying that I had given a\r\nfive-hundred-dollar shed to charity and painted a thousand-dollar ad on\r\nit. Allowed I ought to send my check for that amount to the _creche_\r\nfund. Kept at it till I began to think there might be something in it,\r\nafter all, and sent her the money. Then I found a fellow who wanted to\r\nbuild in that neighborhood, sold him the lot cheap, and got out of the\r\n_creche_ industry. I've put a good deal more than work into my business, and I've drawn a\r\ngood deal more than money out of it; but the only thing I've ever put\r\ninto it which didn't draw dividends in fun or dollars was worry. That is\r\na branch of the trade which you want to leave to our competitors. I've always found worrying a blamed sight more uncertain than\r\nhorse-racing--it's harder to pick a winner at it. You go home worrying\r\nbecause you're afraid that your fool new clerk forgot to lock the safe\r\nafter you, and during the night the lard refinery burns down; you spend\r\na year fretting because you think Bill Jones is going to cut you out\r\nwith your best girl, and then you spend ten worrying because he didn't;\r\nyou worry over Charlie at college because he's a little wild, and he\r\nwrites you that he's been elected president of the Y.M.C.A.; and you\r\nworry over William because he's so pious that you're afraid he's going\r\nto throw up everything and go to China as a missionary, and he draws on\r\nyou for a hundred; you worry because you're afraid your business is\r\ngoing to smash, and your health busts up instead. Worrying is the one\r\ngame in which, if you guess right, you don't get any satisfaction out of\r\nyour smartness. A busy man has no time to bother with it. He can always\r\nfind plenty of old women in skirts or trousers to spend their days\r\nworrying over their own troubles and to sit up nights waking his. Speaking of handing over your worries to others naturally calls to mind\r\nthe Widow Williams and her son Bud, who was a playmate of mine when I\r\nwas a boy. Bud was the youngest of the Widow's troubles, and she was a\r\nwoman whose troubles seldom came singly. Had fourteen altogether, and\r\nfour pair of 'em were twins. Used to turn 'em loose in the morning, when\r\nshe let out her cows and pigs to browse along the street, and then she'd\r\nshed all worry over them for the rest of the day. Allowed that if they\r\ngot hurt the neighbors would bring them home; and that if they got\r\nhungry they'd come home. And someways, the whole drove always showed up\r\nsafe and dirty about meal time. I've no doubt she thought a lot of Bud, but when a woman has fourteen it\r\nsort of unsettles her mind so that she can't focus her affections or\r\nplay any favorites. And so when Bud's clothes were found at the swimming\r\nhole one day, and no Bud inside them, she didn't take on up to the\r\nexpectations of the neighbors who had brought the news, and who were\r\nstanding around waiting for her to go off into something special in the\r\nway of high-strikes. She allowed that they were Bud's clothes, all right, but she wanted to\r\nknow where the remains were. Hinted that there'd be no funeral, or such\r\nlike expensive goings-on, until some one produced the deceased. Take her\r\nby and large, she was a pretty cool, calm cucumber.", "sentences": ["I thought that was pretty good measure, but the carpenters hadn't more\r\nthan finished with the pavilion before the woman telephoned a sharp\r\nmessage to ask why I hadn't had it painted.", "I was too busy that morning to quarrel, so I sent word that I would fix\r\nit up; and when I was driving by there next day the painters were hard\r\nat work on it.", "There was a sixty-foot frontage of that shed on the\r\nAvenue, and I saw right off that it was just a natural signboard.", "So I\r\ncalled over the boss painter and between us we cooked up a nice little\r\nad that ran something like this:\r\n\r\n     Graham's Extract:\r\n     It Makes the Weak Strong.", "Well, sir, when she saw the ad next morning that old hen just\r\nscratched gravel.", "Went all around town saying that I had given a\r\nfive-hundred-dollar shed to charity and painted a thousand-dollar ad on\r\nit.", "Allowed I ought to send my check for that amount to the _creche_\r\nfund.", "Kept at it till I began to think there might be something in it,\r\nafter all, and sent her the money.", "Then I found a fellow who wanted to\r\nbuild in that neighborhood, sold him the lot cheap, and got out of the\r\n_creche_ industry.", "I've put a good deal more than work into my business, and I've drawn a\r\ngood deal more than money out of it; but the only thing I've ever put\r\ninto it which didn't draw dividends in fun or dollars was worry.", "That is\r\na branch of the trade which you want to leave to our competitors.", "I've always found worrying a blamed sight more uncertain than\r\nhorse-racing--it's harder to pick a winner at it.", "You go home worrying\r\nbecause you're afraid that your fool new clerk forgot to lock the safe\r\nafter you, and during the night the lard refinery burns down; you spend\r\na year fretting because you think Bill Jones is going to cut you out\r\nwith your best girl, and then you spend ten worrying because he didn't;\r\nyou worry over Charlie at college because he's a little wild, and he\r\nwrites you that he's been elected president of the Y.M.C.A.; and you\r\nworry over William because he's so pious that you're afraid he's going\r\nto throw up everything and go to China as a missionary, and he draws on\r\nyou for a hundred; you worry because you're afraid your business is\r\ngoing to smash, and your health busts up instead.", "Worrying is the one\r\ngame in which, if you guess right, you don't get any satisfaction out of\r\nyour smartness.", "A busy man has no time to bother with it.", "He can always\r\nfind plenty of old women in skirts or trousers to spend their days\r\nworrying over their own troubles and to sit up nights waking his.", "Speaking of handing over your worries to others naturally calls to mind\r\nthe Widow Williams and her son Bud, who was a playmate of mine when I\r\nwas a boy.", "Bud was the youngest of the Widow's troubles, and she was a\r\nwoman whose troubles seldom came singly.", "Had fourteen altogether, and\r\nfour pair of 'em were twins.", "Used to turn 'em loose in the morning, when\r\nshe let out her cows and pigs to browse along the street, and then she'd\r\nshed all worry over them for the rest of the day.", "Allowed that if they\r\ngot hurt the neighbors would bring them home; and that if they got\r\nhungry they'd come home.", "And someways, the whole drove always showed up\r\nsafe and dirty about meal time.", "I've no doubt she thought a lot of Bud, but when a woman has fourteen it\r\nsort of unsettles her mind so that she can't focus her affections or\r\nplay any favorites.", "And so when Bud's clothes were found at the swimming\r\nhole one day, and no Bud inside them, she didn't take on up to the\r\nexpectations of the neighbors who had brought the news, and who were\r\nstanding around waiting for her to go off into something special in the\r\nway of high-strikes.", "She allowed that they were Bud's clothes, all right, but she wanted to\r\nknow where the remains were.", "Hinted that there'd be no funeral, or such\r\nlike expensive goings-on, until some one produced the deceased.", "Take her\r\nby and large, she was a pretty cool, calm cucumber."], "transcript": [], "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "imageUrl": null, "type": "text", "difficulty": "intermediate", "videoUrl": null, "isFavorite": false, "progress": 0, "author": "Unknown Author"}, {"id": "txt_de_19323_67", "userId": "system_gutenberg", "title": "The Wit and Humor of America, Volume V.

But\r\nfinally, at the end of a week, when they'd strained the whole river\r\nthrough their drags and hadn't anything to show for it but a collection\r\nof tin cans and dead catfish, she threw a shawl over her head and went\r\ndown the street to the cabin of Louisiana Clytemnestra, an old yellow\r\nwoman, who would go into a trance for four bits and find a fortune for\r\nyou for a dollar. I reckon she'd have called herself a clairvoyant\r\nnowadays, but then she was just a voodoo woman. Well, the Widow said she reckoned that boys ought to be let out as well\r\nas in for half price, and so she laid down two bits, allowing that she\r\nwanted a few minutes' private conversation with her Bud.

He'd always been a boy that never could be found when any one\r\nwanted him. So she went off, saying that she'd had her money's worth in\r\nseeing Clytie throw those fancy fits. But next day she came again and\r\npaid down four bits, and Clytie reckoned that that ought to fetch Bud\r\nsure. Someways though, she didn't have any luck, and finally the Widow\r\nsuggested that she call up Bud's father--Buck Williams had been dead a\r\nmatter of ten years--and the old man responded promptly. \"Where's Bud?\" asked the Widow. Hadn't laid eyes on him. Didn't know he'd come across. Had he joined the\r\nchurch before he started? \"No.\"\r\n\r\nThen he'd have to look downstairs for him.

That fetched old Buck Williams'\r\nghost On the jump, you bet, but he said he hadn't laid eyes on Bud yet. They hauled the Sweet By and By with a drag net, but they couldn't get a\r\nrap from him. Clytie trotted out George Washington, and Napoleon, and\r\nBilly Patterson, and Ben Franklin, and Captain Kidd, just to show that\r\nthere was no deception, but they couldn't get a whisper even from Bud.

In fact, the Widow must have touched him at least a\r\nhundred times and every time he was affected to tears, for she was using\r\na bed slat, which is a powerfully strong moral agent for making a boy\r\nsee the error of his ways. And it was a month after that before Bud\r\ncould go down Main Street without some man who had called him a noble\r\nlittle fellow, or a bright, manly little chap, while he was drowned,\r\nreaching out and fetching him a clip on the ear for having come back and\r\nput the laugh on him. No one except the Widow ever really got at the straight of Bud's\r\nconduct, but it appeared that he left home to get a few Indians scalps,\r\nand that he came back for a little bacon and corn pone.

She told herself that she was groping in the vale\r\nof despair, that life was a vast, gray, echoing void. She decided that\r\nambition was dead--a case of starvation; that friendship had slipped\r\nthrough too eagerly grasping fingers; that love--ah, _love_!--\r\n\r\n\"You'd better take a dose of blue-mass,\" her aunt suggested when she had\r\nsighed seven times dolefully at the tea table. \"Not _blue_-mass. Any other kind of mass you please, but _not_ blue,\"\r\nMelinda shuddered absently. No; she was not physically ill; the trouble was deeper--soul sickness,\r\nacute, threatening to become chronic, that defied allopathic doses of\r\nfavorite and other philosophers, that would not yield even to hourly\r\nrepetition of the formula handed down from her grandmother--\"If you can\r\nnot have what you want, try to want what you have.\" Yet she could lay\r\nher finger on no bleeding heart-wound, on no definite cause. It was true\r\nthat the deeply analytical, painstakingly interesting historical novel\r\non which she had worked all winter had been sent back from the\r\npublishers with a briefly polite note of thanks and regrets; but as she\r\nhad never expected anything else, that could not depress her. Also, the\r\nslump in G.C.

So Melinda clenched her hands and moaned in the same key with the east\r\nwind and told the four walls of her room that she could not endure it;\r\nshe must _do_ something. Then it was, that in a flash of inspiration, it\r\ncame to her--she would write a humorous story. The artistic fitness of the idea pleased her. She had always understood\r\nthat humorists were marked by a deep-dyed melancholy, that the height of\r\nunhappiness was a vantage-ground from which to view the joke of\r\nexistence. She would test the dictum; now, if ever, she would write\r\nhumorously. The material was at hand, seething and crowding in her mind,\r\nin fact--the monumental dullness and complacent narrowness of the\r\nvillagers, the egoism, the conceit, the bland shepherd-of-his-flock\r\npomposity of John Graham. What more could a humorist desire? Yes; she\r\nwould write. Thoughts came quick and fast; words flowed in a fiery stream like lava\r\nthat glows and rushes and curls and leaps down the mountain, sweeping\r\nall obstacles aside. (The figure did not wholly please Melinda, for\r\neverybody knows how dull and gray and uninteresting lava is when it\r\ncools, but she had no time to bother with another.) She felt the\r\nexultation, the joy and uplifting of spirit that is the reward--usually,\r\nalas, the sole reward--of the writer in the work of creation. Then before the lava had time to cool she sent the story to the first\r\nmagazine on her list with a name beginning with \"A.\" It was her custom\r\nto send them that way, though sometimes with a desire to be impartial\r\nshe commenced at \"Z\" and went up the list. At the end of two weeks the wind had ceased blowing from the east. Melinda decided that though life for her must be gray, echoing, void,\r\nyet would she make an effort for the joy of others. She would lift\r\nherself above the depression that enfolded her even as the buoyant\r\nhyacinths were cleaving their dark husks and lifting up the beauty and\r\nfragrance of their hearts to solace passers-by. Therefore she ceased\r\nparting her hair in the middle and ordered a simple little frock from\r\nD----'s--hyacinth blue _voile_ with a lining that should whisper and\r\nrustle like the glad winds whisking away last year's leaves. Then the day came when she strolled carelessly and unexpectantly down\r\nthe village street to the post-office and there received a letter that\r\nbore on the upper left-hand corner of the envelope the name of the\r\nmagazine first on her list beginning with \"A.\" A chill passed along\r\nMelinda's spine. That humorous story--Could this mean?--It was too\r\nhorrible to contemplate. She took a short cut through the orchard and as she walked she tore off\r\na corner and peeped into the envelope. Yes, there was a pale-blue slip\r\nof paper with serrated edges. She leaned against a Baldwin apple-tree to\r\nthink. How true it is that one should be prepared for the unexpected. Melinda\r\nhad sent out many manuscripts freighted with tingling hopes and eager\r\naspirations and with the postage stamps that insured their prompt\r\nreturn; how was she to know, by what process of reasoning could she\r\ninfer that this, that had been offered simply from force of habit, would\r\nbe retained in exchange for an aesthetically tinted check? She\r\nanathematized the magazine editor. (That seems the proper thing to do\r\nwith editors.) She wanted to know what business he had to keep that\r\nstory after having led her to believe that it was his unbreakable custom\r\nto send them back. It was deception, she told the swelling Baldwin buds,\r\nbase, deep-dyed, subtle deception. After baiting her on with his little,\r\npink, printed rejection slips, he suddenly sprung a wicked trap. It was some time before Melinda grew calm enough to read the editorial\r\nletter. It ran:\r\n\r\n     _\"Dear Madam--We are glad to have your tender and delicately\r\n     sympathetic picture of village life.", "sentences": ["Then, the Reverend John Graham;--but what John Graham\r\ndid or said was nothing--absolutely nothing, to her.", "So Melinda clenched her hands and moaned in the same key with the east\r\nwind and told the four walls of her room that she could not endure it;\r\nshe must _do_ something.", "Then it was, that in a flash of inspiration, it\r\ncame to her--she would write a humorous story.", "The artistic fitness of the idea pleased her.", "She had always understood\r\nthat humorists were marked by a deep-dyed melancholy, that the height of\r\nunhappiness was a vantage-ground from which to view the joke of\r\nexistence.", "She would test the dictum; now, if ever, she would write\r\nhumorously.", "The material was at hand, seething and crowding in her mind,\r\nin fact--the monumental dullness and complacent narrowness of the\r\nvillagers, the egoism, the conceit, the bland shepherd-of-his-flock\r\npomposity of John Graham.", "What more could a humorist desire?", "Yes; she\r\nwould write.", "Thoughts came quick and fast; words flowed in a fiery stream like lava\r\nthat glows and rushes and curls and leaps down the mountain, sweeping\r\nall obstacles aside.", "(The figure did not wholly please Melinda, for\r\neverybody knows how dull and gray and uninteresting lava is when it\r\ncools, but she had no time to bother with another.)

(of X.) (Part 71)", "language": "de", "content": "There is a note of true\r\n     sentiment and a generous appreciation of homely virtue marking this\r\n     story for which we desire to add an especial word of praise. Check\r\n     enclosed._\r\n\r\n     _\"Very truly yours,\r\n     \"The Editor of A----.\"_\r\n\r\nMelinda sank limply on the bleached, last year's grass at the foot of\r\nthe tree. \"Tender and delicately sympathetic picture\"--\"Generous\r\nappreciation!\" She laughed feebly. The editor was pleased to be\r\nfacetious. Having a fine sense of humor himself he showed his\r\nrealization of the story by acknowledging it in the same vein of subtle\r\nsatire. She reread the letter and unfolded the slip of paper with serrated\r\nedges with changing emotions. After all it was not such a very bad\r\nstory. She permitted herself to recall how humorous it was, how\r\ncleverly and keenly it laid bare the ridiculous, the unexpected, how\r\nit scintillated with wit and abounded in droll and subtle distinctions\r\nand descriptions--all--all at the expense of her nearest relatives and\r\nher dearest friends. Melinda thought she would return the check and demand that her story be\r\nsent back to her or destroyed; but, reflecting that Punch's advice is\r\napplicable to other things than matrimony and suicide, she didn't. She\r\nresolutely put her literary Frankenstein behind her. She reasoned that\r\nin all probability the story would not be published during the lifetime\r\nof any of the originals of the characters; that even if the worst came\r\nto the worst, Mossdale was likely to remain in ignorance that would be\r\nblissful. The villagers were not wont to waste time on the printed word;\r\nin fact, such was the profundity of their unenlightenment, few of them\r\nhad heard of the magazine with a name beginning with \"A.\" Even John\r\nGraham paid little attention to the secular periodicals; besides, if\r\nabsolutely necessary, John's attention might be diverted. So Melinda went away on a visit. Her health demanded it. The doctor was\r\nunable to name her malady, but she herself diagnosed it as\r\n_magazinitis_. Toward fall Melinda, entirely recovered, returned to Mossdale. Entirely\r\nrecovered, yet she turned cold, unseeing eyes on the newsboy when he\r\npassed through the car with his towering load of varicolored\r\nperiodicals, and rather than be forced to the final resort of the\r\nunaccompanied traveler, she welcomed the advent of an acquaintance\r\npossessed of volubility of an ejaculatory, eruptive variety. After many\r\ngentle jets and spurts of gossip much remained to be told, as the lady\r\nhastily gathered up her impedimenta preparatory to alighting at her home\r\nstation. \"How like me in the joy of seeing you, to forget! What a sweet, clever\r\nstory! And to think of _you_ having something published in 'A----'! I\r\nnever was more surprised than when Mr. Ferguson brought home the\r\nmagazine. Those delicious Mossdale people! I could not endure that the\r\ndear things should not see and know at once. The lovely hamlet is so--so\r\nremote, and I knew you were traveling.

Her humorous story had been given to an eager public. She\r\nleaned back and gazed out at the flying telegraph poles and fields. Even\r\nthe worthiest, the gravest, the finest, she reflected, has a face, that\r\nif seen in a certain light, will flash out the ignus fatuus of the\r\nridiculous; but it is not usually considered the office of friendship to\r\nturn on the betraying light.

Her Uncle Joe met her at the station and kissed her for the first time\r\nsince she had put on long dresses. Notwithstanding a foolish prejudice\r\nagainst tobacco juice Melinda received the salute in a meek and contrite\r\nspirit. \"Notice how many citizens were hanging around underfoot on the depot\r\nplatform--so as you kinder had to stop and shake hands to get 'em out o'\r\nthe way?\" Uncle Joe queried as he turned the colts' heads toward home.

As she turned the leaves she caught sight of a manly form\r\ncarefully climbing the fence.

You only\r\ncharged me _three_ as I went down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Captaing,\" drawled out the wood merchant, with a sort of leer on\r\nhis yellow countenance, which clearly indicated that his wood was as\r\ngood as sold, \"wood's riz since you went down two weeks ago; besides,\r\nyou are awar that you very seldom stop going _down_--when you're going\r\n_up_ you're sometimes obleeged to give me a call, becaze the current's\r\naginst you, and there's no other woodyard for nine miles ahead; and if\r\nyou happen to be nearly out of fooel, why--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" interrupted the Captain, \"we'll take a few cords, under\r\nthe circumstances,\" and he returned to his game of brag. In about half an hour we felt the _Caravan_ commence paddling again. Supper was over, and I retired to my upper berth, situated alongside and\r\noverlooking the brag-table, where the Captain was deeply engaged, having\r\nnow the _other_ pilot as his principal opponent. We jogged on\r\nquietly--and seemed to be going at a good rate. \"How does that wood burn?\" inquired the Captain of the mate, who was\r\nlooking on at the game. \"'Tisn't of much account, I reckon,\" answered the mate; \"it's\r\ncottonwood, and most of it green at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well Thompson--(Three aces again, stranger--I'll take that X and the\r\nsmall change, if you please.

This pilot's beating us all to smash.\"\r\n\r\nThe wooding completed, we paddled on again. The Captain seemed somewhat\r\nvexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the\r\nlast woodyard--_three and a quarter_; but soon again became interested\r\nin the game.
