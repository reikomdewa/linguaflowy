Each is distinguished by its own special\r characteristics. The Tale consists simply in the narration of a story\r either founded on facts, or created solely by the imagination, and not\r necessarily associated with the teaching of any moral lesson. The\r Parable is the designed use of language purposely intended to convey a\r hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words\r themselves; and which may or may not bear a special reference to the\r hearer, or reader. The Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs\r from both of these. It will contain, like the Tale, a short but real\r narrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a hidden meaning,\r and that not so much by the use of language, as by the skilful\r introduction of fictitious characters; and yet, unlike to either Tale\r or Parable, it will ever keep in view, as its high prerogative, and\r inseparable attribute, the great purpose of instruction, and will\r necessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim, social duty, or\r political truth. The true Fable, if it rise to its high requirements,\r ever aims at one great end and purpose—the representation of human\r motive, and the improvement of human conduct, and yet it so conceals\r its design under the disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing\r with speech the animals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees\r of the wood, or the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive\r advice without perceiving the presence of the adviser. Thus the\r superiority of the counsellor, which often renders counsel unpalatable,\r is kept out of view, and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance\r when the reader is led, unconsciously to himself, to have his\r sympathies enlisted in behalf of what is pure, honourable, and\r praiseworthy, and to have his indignation excited against what is low,\r ignoble, and unworthy. The true fabulist, therefore, discharges a most\r important function. He is neither a narrator, nor an allegorist. He is\r a great teacher, a corrector of morals, a censor of vice, and a\r commender of virtue. In this consists the superiority of the Fable over\r the Tale or the Parable. The fabulist is to create a laugh, but yet,\r under a merry guise, to convey instruction. Phædrus, the great imitator\r of Æsop, plainly indicates this double purpose to be the true office of\r the writer of fables.\r \r     Duplex libelli dos est: quod risum movet,\r     Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet.\r \r The continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm, and\r accounts for the universal favour, of the fables of Æsop. “The fable,”\r says Professor K. O. Mueller, “originated in Greece in an intentional\r travestie of human affairs. The ‘ainos,’ as its name denotes, is an\r admonition, or rather a reproof, veiled, either from fear of an excess\r of frankness, or from a love of fun and jest, beneath the fiction of an\r occurrence happening among beasts; and wherever we have any ancient and\r authentic account of the Æsopian fables, we find it to be the same.”[1]\r \r The construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1), the\r narration itself; (2), the deduction of the moral; and (3), a careful\r maintenance of the individual characteristics of the fictitious\r personages introduced into it. The narration should relate to one\r simple action, consistent with itself, and neither be overladen with a\r multiplicity of details, nor distracted by a variety of circumstances.\r The moral or lesson should be so plain, and so intimately interwoven\r with, and so necessarily dependent on, the narration, that every reader\r should be compelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation.\r The introduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be\r marked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their natural\r attributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by universal\r popular consent. The Fox should be always cunning, the Hare timid, the\r Lion bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the Horse proud, and the\r Ass patient. Many of these fables are characterized by the strictest\r observance of these rules. They are occupied with one short narrative,\r from which the moral naturally flows, and with which it is intimately\r associated. “’Tis the simple manner,” says Dodsley,[2] “in which the\r morals of Æsop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him,\r and gives him the preference over all other mythologists. His ‘Mountain\r delivered of a Mouse,’ produces the moral of his fable in ridicule of\r pompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops her cheese, lets fall,\r as it were by accident, the strongest admonition against the power of\r flattery. There is no need of a separate sentence to explain it; no\r possibility of impressing it deeper, by that load we too often see of\r accumulated reflections.”[3] An equal amount of praise is due for the\r consistency with which the characters of the animals, fictitiously\r introduced, are marked. While they are made to depict the motives and\r passions of men, they retain, in an eminent degree, their own special\r features of craft or counsel, of cowardice or courage, of generosity or\r rapacity.\r \r These terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed on all\r the fables in this collection. Many of them lack that unity of design,\r that close connection of the moral with the narrative, that wise choice\r in the introduction of the animals, which constitute the charm and\r excellency of true Æsopian fable. This inferiority of some to others is\r sufficiently accounted for in the history of the origin and descent of\r these fables. The great bulk of them are not the immediate work of\r Æsop. Many are obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which\r he lived. Thus, the fable of the “Hawk and the Nightingale” is related\r by Hesiod;[4] the “Eagle wounded by an Arrow, winged with its own\r feathers,” by Æschylus;[5] the “Fox avenging his wrongs on the Eagle,”\r by Archilochus.[6] Many of them again are of later origin, and are to\r be traced to the monks of the middle ages: and yet this collection,\r though thus made up of fables both earlier and later than the era of\r Æsop, rightfully bears his name, because he composed so large a number\r (all framed in the same mould, and conformed to the same fashion, and\r stamped with the same lineaments, image, and superscription) as to\r secure to himself the right to be considered the father of Greek\r fables, and the founder of this class of writing, which has ever since\r borne his name, and has secured for him, through all succeeding ages,\r the position of the first of moralists.[7]\r \r The fables were in the first instance only narrated by Æsop, and for a\r long time were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral tradition.\r Socrates is mentioned by Plato[8] as having employed his time while in\r prison, awaiting the return of the sacred ship from Delphos which was\r to be the signal of his death, in turning some of these fables into\r verse, but he thus versified only such as he remembered. Demetrius\r Phalereus, a philosopher at Athens about 300 B.C., is said to have made\r the first collection of these fables. Phædrus, a slave by birth or by\r subsequent misfortunes, and admitted by Augustus to the honours of a\r freedman, imitated many of these fables in Latin iambics about the\r commencement of the Christian era. Aphthonius, a rhetorician of\r Antioch, A.D. 315, wrote a treatise on, and converted into Latin prose,\r some of these fables. This translation is the more worthy of notice, as\r it illustrates a custom of common use, both in these and in later\r times. The rhetoricians and philosophers were accustomed to give the\r Fables of Æsop as an exercise to their scholars, not only inviting them\r to discuss the moral of the tale, but also to practice and to perfect\r themselves thereby in style and rules of grammar, by making for\r themselves new and various versions of the fables. Ausonius,[9] the\r friend of the Emperor Valentinian, and the latest poet of eminence in\r the Western Empire, has handed down some of these fables in verse,\r which Julianus Titianus, a contemporary writer of no great name,\r translated into prose. Avienus, also a contemporary of Ausonius, put\r some of these fables into Latin elegiacs, which are given by Nevelet\r (in a book we shall refer to hereafter), and are occasionally\r incorporated with the editions of Phædrus.\r \r Seven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the Fables\r of Æsop. During this long period these fables seem to have suffered an\r eclipse, to have disappeared and to have been forgotten; and it is at\r the commencement of the fourteenth century, when the Byzantine emperors\r were the great patrons of learning, and amidst the splendors of an\r Asiatic court, that we next find honours paid to the name and memory of\r Æsop. Maximus Planudes, a learned monk of Constantinople, made a\r collection of about a hundred and fifty of these fables. Little is\r known of his history. Planudes, however, was no mere recluse, shut up\r in his monastery. He took an active part in public affairs. In 1327\r A.D. he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Venice by the Emperor\r Andronicus the Elder. This brought him into immediate contact with the\r Western Patriarch, whose interests he henceforth advocated with so much\r zeal as to bring on him suspicion and persecution from the rulers of\r the Eastern Church. Planudes has been exposed to a two-fold accusation.\r He is charged on the one hand with having had before him a copy of\r Babrias (to whom we shall have occasion to refer at greater length in\r the end of this Preface), and to have had the bad taste “to transpose,”\r or to turn his poetical version into prose: and he is asserted, on the\r other hand, never to have seen the Fables of Æsop at all, but to have\r himself invented and made the fables which he palmed off under the name\r of the famous Greek fabulist. The truth lies between these two\r extremes. Planudes may have invented some few fables, or have inserted\r some that were current in his day; but there is an abundance of\r unanswerable internal evidence to prove that he had an acquaintance\r with the veritable fables of Æsop, although the versions he had access\r to were probably corrupt, as contained in the various translations and\r disquisitional exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers. His\r collection is interesting and important, not only as the parent source\r or foundation of the earlier printed versions of Æsop, but as the\r direct channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the\r learned.\r \r The eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Æsop to their\r high place in the general literature of Christendom, is to be looked\r for in the West rather than in the East. The calamities gradually\r thickening round the Eastern Empire, and the fall of Constantinople,\r 1453 A.D. combined with other events to promote the rapid restoration\r of learning in Italy; and with that recovery of learning the revival of\r an interest in the Fables of Æsop is closely identified. These fables,\r indeed, were among the first writings of an earlier antiquity that\r attracted attention. They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures\r and the ancient classic authors, in the minds of the great students of\r that day. Lorenzo Valla, one of the most famous promoters of Italian\r learning, not only translated into Latin the Iliad of Homer and the\r Histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, but also the Fables of Æsop.\r \r These fables, again, were among the books brought into an extended\r circulation by the agency of the printing press. Bonus Accursius, as\r early as 1475–1480, printed the collection of these fables, made by\r Planudes, which, within five years afterwards, Caxton translated into\r English, and printed at his press in Westminster Abbey, 1485.[10] It\r must be mentioned also that the learning of this age has left permanent\r traces of its influence on these fables,[11] by causing the\r interpolation with them (as a κτῆμα εἰς ἰει) of some of those amusing\r stories which were so frequently introduced into the public discourses\r of the great preachers of those days, and of which specimens are yet to\r be found in the extant sermons of Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel\r Barlette.[12] The publication of this era which most probably has\r influenced these fables, is the “Liber Facetiarum,”[13] a book\r consisting of a hundred jests and stories, by the celebrated Poggio\r Bracciolini, published A.D. 1471, from which the two fables of the\r “Miller, his Son, and the Ass,” and the “Fox and the Woodcutter,” are\r undoubtedly selected.\r \r The knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into Germany,\r and their popularity was increased by the favour and sanction given to\r them by the great fathers of the Reformation, who frequently used them\r as vehicles for satire and protest against the tricks and abuses of the\r Romish ecclesiastics. The zealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an\r active part in the preparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found\r time, amidst his numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the\r students in the University of Tübingen, in which he was a professor.\r Martin Luther translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by\r Melancthon to complete the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the\r celebrated Lutheran theologian, and librarian to Frederick I., king of\r Prussia, mentions that the great Reformer valued the Fables of Æsop\r next after the Holy Scriptures. In 1546 A.D. the second printed edition\r of the collection of the Fables made by Planudes, was issued from the\r printing-press of Robert Stephens, in which were inserted some\r additional fables from a MS. in the Bibliothêque du Roy at Paris.\r \r The greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the Fables\r of Æsop to a place in the literature of the world, was made in the\r early part of the seventeenth century. In the year 1610, a learned\r Swiss, Isaac Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the third printed edition of\r these fables, in a work entitled “Mythologia Æsopica.” This was a noble\r effort to do honour to the great fabulist, and was the most perfect\r collection of Æsopian fables ever yet published. It consisted, in\r addition to the collection of fables given by Planudes and reprinted in\r the various earlier editions, of one hundred and thirty-six new fables\r (never before published) from MSS. in the Library of the Vatican, of\r forty fables attributed to Aphthonius, and of forty-three from Babrias.\r It also contained the Latin versions of the same fables by Phædrus,\r Avienus, and other authors. This volume of Nevelet forms a complete\r “Corpus Fabularum Æsopicarum;” and to his labours Æsop owes his\r restoration to universal favour as one of the wise moralists and great\r teachers of mankind. During the interval of three centuries which has\r elapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet’s, no book,\r with the exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider circulation\r than Æsop’s Fables. They have been translated into the greater number\r of the languages both of Europe and of the East, and have been read,\r and will be read, for generations, alike by Jew, Heathen, Mohammedan,\r and Christian. They are, at the present time, not only engrafted into\r the literature of the civilized world, but are familiar as household\r words in the common intercourse and daily conversation of the\r inhabitants of all countries.\r \r This collection of Nevelet’s is the great culminating point in the\r history of the revival of the fame and reputation of Æsopian Fables. It\r is remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the germ of an idea,\r which has been since proved to have been correct by a strange chain of\r circumstances. Nevelet intimates an opinion, that a writer named\r Babrias would be found to be the veritable author of the existing form\r of Æsopian Fables. This intimation has since given rise to a series of\r inquiries, the knowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to\r a full understanding of the true position of Æsop in connection with\r the writings that bear his name.\r \r The history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it might not\r unfitly be enumerated among the curiosities of literature. He is\r generally supposed to have been a Greek of Asia Minor, of one of the\r Ionic Colonies, but the exact period in which he lived and wrote is yet\r unsettled. He is placed, by one critic,[14] as far back as the\r institution of the Achaian League, B.C. 250; by another as late as the\r Emperor Severus, who died A.D. 235; while others make him a\r contemporary with Phædrus in the time of Augustus. At whatever time he\r wrote his version of Æsop, by some strange accident it seems to have\r entirely disappeared, and to have been lost sight of. His name is\r mentioned by Avienus; by Suidas, a celebrated critic, at the close of\r the eleventh century, who gives in his lexicon several isolated verses\r of his version of the fables; and by John Tzetzes, a grammarian and\r poet of Constantinople, who lived during the latter half of the twelfth\r century. Nevelet, in the preface to the volume which we have described,\r points out that the Fables of Planudes could not be the work of Æsop,\r as they contain a reference in two places to “Holy monks,” and give a\r verse from the Epistle of St. James as an “Epimith” to one of the\r fables, and suggests Babrias as their author. Francis Vavassor,[15] a\r learned French jesuit, entered at greater length on this subject, and\r produced further proofs from internal evidence, from the use of the\r word Piræus in describing the harbour of Athens, a name which was not\r given till two hundred years after Æsop, and from the introduction of\r other modern words, that many of these fables must have been at least\r committed to writing posterior to the time of Æsop, and more boldly\r suggests Babrias as their author or collector.[16] These various\r references to Babrias induced Dr. Richard Bentley, at the close of the\r seventeenth century, to examine more minutely the existing versions of\r Æsop’s Fables, and he maintained that many of them could, with a slight\r change of words, be resolved into the Scazonic[17] iambics, in which\r Babrias is known to have written: and, with a greater freedom than the\r evidence then justified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claim to\r the exclusive authorship of these fables. Such a seemingly extravagant\r theory, thus roundly asserted, excited much opposition. Dr. Bentley[18]\r met with an able antagonist in a member of the University of Oxford,\r the Hon. Mr. Charles Boyle,[19] afterwards Earl of Orrery. Their\r letters and disputations on this subject, enlivened on both sides with\r much wit and learning, will ever bear a conspicuous place in the\r literary history of the seventeenth century. The arguments of Dr.\r Bentley were yet further defended a few years later by Mr. Thomas\r Tyrwhitt, a well-read scholar, who gave up high civil distinctions that\r he might devote himself the more unreservedly to literary pursuits. Mr.\r Tyrwhitt published, A.D. 1776, a Dissertation on Babrias, and a\r collection of his fables in choliambic metre found in a MS. in the\r Bodleian Library at Oxford. Francesco de Furia, a learned Italian,\r contributed further testimony to the correctness of the supposition\r that Babrias had made a veritable collection of fables by printing from\r a MS. contained in the Vatican library several fables never before\r published. In the year 1844, however, new and unexpected light was\r thrown upon this subject. A veritable copy of Babrias was found in a\r manner as singular as were the MSS. of Quinctilian’s Institutes, and of\r Cicero’s Orations by Poggio in the monastery of St. Gall A.D. 1416. M.\r Menoides, at the suggestion of M. Villemain, Minister of Public\r Instruction to King Louis Philippe, had been entrusted with a\r commission to search for ancient MSS., and in carrying out his\r instructions he found a MS. at the convent of St. Laura, on Mount\r Athos, which proved to be a copy of the long suspected and wished-for\r choliambic version of Babrias. This MS. was found to be divided into\r two books, the one containing a hundred and twenty-five, and the other\r ninety-five fables. This discovery attracted very general attention,\r not only as confirming, in a singular manner, the conjectures so boldly\r made by a long chain of critics, but as bringing to light valuable\r literary treasures tending to establish the reputation, and to confirm\r the antiquity and authenticity of the great mass of Æsopian Fable. The\r Fables thus recovered were soon published. They found a most worthy\r editor in the late distinguished Sir George Cornewall Lewis, and a\r translator equally qualified for his task, in the Reverend James\r Davies, M.A., sometime a scholar of Lincoln College, Oxford, and\r himself a relation of their English editor. Thus, after an eclipse of\r many centuries, Babrias shines out as the earliest, and most reliable\r collector of veritable Æsopian Fables.\r \r Having thus given a complete synopsis of the origin, descent, and\r history of these fables, it only remains to explain the reasons which\r have induced the Publishers to prepare a new edition of Æsop, and to\r state the grounds on which they hope to establish a claim for support\r and public approval in their undertaking. They boldly assert that the\r new light thrown upon these fables by the discovery of the metrical\r version by Babrias, renders a new translation an inevitable necessity.\r The two chief existing English versions of Æsop are those by Archdeacon\r Croxall, and by the late Rev. Thomas James, canon of Peterborough. The\r first of these deviates so very far from the text, that it degenerates\r into a parody. The fables are so padded, diluted, and altered, as to\r give very little idea to the reader either of the terseness or the\r meaning of the original. The second of these is an improvement on its\r predecessor, but Mr. James, either out of compliance with the wishes of\r the publishers, or in condescension to the taste prevalent some twenty\r years ago, has so freely introduced as the point of the fable\r conventional English sayings which are not sanctioned by the Greek, and\r which in many instances are scarcely equivalent to it, that his version\r frequently approaches a paraphrase rather than a translation.\r \r The Publishers therefore ground their first claim for public approval\r on the necessity of a new translation. They trust further that their\r present work will have met that necessity in a satisfactory manner.\r They have sought to give as nearly a literal translation as possible of\r the Greek text; and they hope that if the reader should miss the\r smoothness and thoroughly English tone which characterized the previous\r version of these fables, he will be more than repaid by gaining a\r nearer approach to the spirit, thoughts, and (in some cases) to the\r epigrammatic terseness of the original. The Publishers trust to\r vindicate, on another ground, their claims to a share of public\r patronage. They have inserted a hundred new fables, and they have the\r satisfaction of knowing that this edition, on which they have spared no\r pains nor cost, will afford a larger choice, and greater variety, to\r the numerous and increasing circle of the admirers of Æsopian Fables.\r Whatever be the result of their labours, they will be content to have\r contributed towards promoting a wider acquaintance with fables, the\r wisdom, excellency, and wonderful suitableness of which to every\r condition of humanity has been attested and confirmed by the experience\r of so many generations; and which in all ages, amidst the ever changing\r fluctuations of human opinion, are adapted alike to amuse the young,\r and to instruct the thoughtful, and are well fitted to teach all who\r study them lessons useful for their guidance in every position of\r political, social, civil, or domestic life.\r \r The Editor must claim the privilege of adding a few words on a matter\r personal to himself. He has already within the last few months been\r connected with one edition of Æsop, and it may seem strange that he\r should be willing to undertake the superintendence of another. His\r answer is, that the two works on which he has been engaged were totally\r distinct, and entirely independent of each other. The first was a\r request to furnish new morals and applications to a definite number of\r fables; Ihe other was a commission to add a large number of additional\r fables and to make a wholly new translation. The necessity of a new and\r improved translation the Editor then recognized, and would have\r willingly undertaken. It was a wish he had much at heart, and when the\r proposal was voluntarily made to him by the present Publishers, to\r undertake the task of a new translation of an enlarged number of Æsop’s\r Fables, he saw no reason for refusing the offer because of his prior\r discharge of a totally different design; and he resolved to comply with\r the request submitted to him, and to do his best towards the attainment\r of so desirable an object as a purer translation and more literal\r rendering of fables so justly celebrated.\r \r The following are the sources from which the present translation has\r been prepared:—\r \r Babrii Fabulæ Æsopeæ.

Sardis, the capital of Lydia;\r Samos, a Greek island; Mesembria, an ancient colony in Thrace; and\r Cotiæum, the chief city of a province of Phrygia, contend for the\r distinction of being the birthplace of Æsop. Although the honour thus\r claimed cannot be definitely assigned to any one of these places, yet\r there are a few incidents now generally accepted by scholars as\r established facts, relating to the birth, life, and death of Æsop. He\r is, by an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about the\r year 620 B.C., and to have been by birth a slave. He was owned by two\r masters in succession, both inhabitants of Samos, Xanthus and Jadmon,\r the latter of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for his learning\r and wit. One of the privileges of a freedman in the ancient republics\r of Greece, was the permission to take an active interest in public\r affairs; and Æsop, like the philosophers Phædo, Menippus, and\r Epictetus, in later times, raised himself from the indignity of a\r servile condition to a position of high renown. In his desire alike to\r instruct and to be instructed, he travelled through many countries, and\r among others came to Sardis, the capital of the famous king of Lydia,\r the great patron, in that day, of learning and of learned men. He met\r at the court of Crœsus with Solon, Thales, and other sages, and is\r related so to have pleased his royal master by the part he took in the\r conversations held with these philosophers, that he applied to him an\r expression which has since passed into a proverb, “μᾶλλον ὁ Φρύξ.” “The\r Phrygian has spoken better than all.”\r \r On the invitation of Crœsus he fixed his residence at Sardis, and was\r employed by that monarch in various difficult and delicate affairs of\r State. In his discharge of these commissions he visited the different\r petty republics of Greece. At one time he is found in Corinth, and at\r another in Athens, endeavouring, by the narration of some of his wise\r fables, to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities to the\r administration of their respective rulers Periander and Pisistratus.\r One of these ambassadorial missions, undertaken at the command of\r Crœsus, was the occasion of his death. Having been sent to Delphi with\r a large sum of gold for distribution among the citizens, he was so\r provoked at their covetousness that he refused to divide the money, and\r sent it back to his master. The Delphians, enraged at this treatment,\r accused him of impiety, and, in spite of his sacred character as\r ambassador, executed him as a public criminal. This cruel death of Æsop\r was not unavenged. The citizens of Delphi were visited with a series of\r calamities, until they made a public reparation of their crime; and,\r “The blood of Æsop” became a well-known adage, bearing witness to the\r truth that deeds of wrong would not pass unpunished. Neither did the\r great fabulist lack posthumous honours; for a statue was erected to his\r memory at Athens, the work of Lysippus, one of the most famous of Greek\r sculptors. Phædrus thus immortalizes the event:—\r \r     Æsopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici,\r     Servumque collocarunt æternâ in basi:\r     Patere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam;\r     Nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam.\r \r These few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of\r certainty, in reference to the birth, life, and death of Æsop. They\r were first brought to light, after a patient search and diligent\r perusal of ancient authors, by a Frenchman, M. Claude Gaspard Bachet de\r Mezeriac, who declined the honour of being tutor to Louis XIII. of\r France, from his desire to devote himself exclusively to literature. He\r published his Life of Æsop, Anno Domini 1632. The later investigations\r of a host of English and German scholars have added very little to the\r facts given by M. Mezeriac. The substantial truth of his statements has\r been confirmed by later criticism and inquiry. It remains to state,\r that prior to this publication of M. Mezeriac, the life of Æsop was\r from the pen of Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople, who was\r sent on an embassy to Venice by the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus the\r elder, and who wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century. His\r life was prefixed to all the early editions of these fables, and was\r republished as late as 1727 by Archdeacon Croxall as the introduction\r to his edition of Æsop. This life by Planudes contains, however, so\r small an amount of truth, and is so full of absurd pictures of the\r grotesque deformity of Æsop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying\r legends, and gross anachronisms, that it is now universally condemned\r as false, puerile, and unauthentic.[20] It is given up in the present\r day, by general consent, as unworthy of the slightest credit.\r \r \r \r \r AESOP’S FABLES\r \r \r \r \r The Lion And The Mouse\r \r \r A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising\r up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse\r piteously entreated, saying: “If you would only spare my life, I would\r be sure to repay your kindness.” The Lion laughed and let him go. It\r happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters,\r who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing his\r roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free,\r exclaiming:\r \r “You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not\r expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favour; now you know\r that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.”\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf And The Lamb\r \r \r WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay\r violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the\r Wolf’s right to eat him. He thus addressed him: “Sirrah, last year you\r grossly insulted me.” “Indeed,” bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of\r voice, “I was not then born.” Then said the Wolf, “You feed in my\r pasture.” “No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have not yet tasted\r grass.” Again said the Wolf, “You drink of my well.” “No,” exclaimed\r the Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is both\r food and drink to me.” Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up,\r saying, “Well! I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every\r one of my imputations.” The tyrant will always find a pretext for his\r tyranny.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass And The Grasshopper\r \r \r AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted;\r and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort\r of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied,\r “The dew.” The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a\r short time died of hunger.\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Crane\r \r \r A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large\r sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the\r Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the\r Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: “Why, you have surely\r already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw\r out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.”\r \r In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape\r injury for your pains.\r \r \r \r \r The Father And His Sons\r \r \r A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among\r themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations,\r he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of\r disunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a\r bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the\r hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in\r pieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it.\r He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and\r again put them into his sons’ hands, upon which they broke them easily.\r He then addressed them in these words: “My sons, if you are of one\r mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot,\r uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided\r among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.”\r \r \r \r \r The Bat And The Weasels\r \r \r A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be\r spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the\r enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a\r mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to\r the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated\r not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to\r mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus\r a second time escaped.\r \r It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.\r \r \r \r \r The Cock and the Jewel\r \r \r A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious\r stone and exclaimed: “If your owner had found thee, and not I, he would\r have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have\r found thee for no purpose. I would rather have one barleycorn than all\r the jewels in the world.”\r \r \r \r \r The Swallow and the Crow\r \r \r THE SWALLOW and the Crow had a contention about their plumage. The Crow\r put an end to the dispute by saying, “Your feathers are all very well\r in the spring, but mine protect me against the winter.”\r \r Fair weather friends are not worth much.\r \r \r \r \r The Kingdom of the Lion\r \r \r THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He was\r neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king\r could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general\r assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a\r universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the\r Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together\r in perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, “Oh, how I have longed to\r see this day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by\r the side of the strong.” And after the Hare said this, he ran for his\r life.\r \r \r \r \r The Traveler and His Dog\r \r \r A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door\r stretching himself. He asked him sharply: “Why do you stand there\r gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.” The\r Dog, wagging his tail, replied: “O, master! I am quite ready; it is you\r for whom I am waiting.”\r \r The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.\r \r \r \r \r The Ants and the Grasshopper\r \r \r THE ANTS were spending a fine winter’s day drying grain collected in\r the summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and\r earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, “Why did\r you not treasure up food during the summer?” He replied, “I had not\r leisure enough. I passed the days in singing.” They then said in\r derision: “If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must\r dance supperless to bed in the winter.”\r \r \r \r \r The Hare and the Tortoise\r \r \r A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise,\r who replied, laughing: “Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat\r you in a race.” The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply\r impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox\r should choose the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the\r race the two started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped,\r but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the\r course. The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last\r waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had\r reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.\r \r Slow but steady wins the race.\r \r \r \r \r The Charcoal-Burner And The Fuller\r \r \r A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met\r a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying\r that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping\r expenses would be lessened. The Fuller replied, “The arrangement is\r impossible as far as I am concerned, for whatever I should whiten, you\r would immediately blacken again with your charcoal.”\r \r Like will draw like.\r \r \r \r \r The Boy Hunting Locusts\r \r \r A BOY was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number, when he\r saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to\r take him. The Scorpion, showing his sting, said: “If you had but\r touched me, my friend, you would have lost me, and all your locusts\r too!”\r \r \r \r \r The Fisherman Piping\r \r \r A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the\r seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the\r hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord\r dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long\r waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the\r sea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in\r the net upon the rock he said: “O you most perverse creatures, when I\r piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so\r merrily.”\r \r \r \r \r The Dog and the Shadow\r \r \r A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his\r mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another\r Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go\r of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece\r from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water,\r because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.\r \r \r \r \r Hercules and the Wagoner\r \r \r A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank\r down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood\r looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules\r to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed\r him: “Put your shoulders to the wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks,\r and never more pray to me for help, until you have done your best to\r help yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain.”\r \r Self-help is the best help.\r \r \r \r \r The Mole and His Mother\r \r \r A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: “I am\r sure than I can see, Mother!” In the desire to prove to him his\r mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and\r asked, “What is it?” The young Mole said, “It is a pebble.” His Mother\r exclaimed: “My son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that\r you have lost your sense of smell.”\r \r \r \r \r The Herdsman and the Lost Bull\r \r \r A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the\r fold. After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he\r could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a\r lamb in sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the\r forest. Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at\r its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted\r his eyes and his hands to heaven, and said: “Just now I vowed to offer\r a lamb to the Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out\r who had robbed me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would\r willingly add a full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only\r secure my own escape from him in safety.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fawn and His Mother\r \r \r A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, “You are larger than a dog, and\r swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a\r defense; why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?” She\r smiled, and said: “I know full well, my son, that all you say is true.\r I have the advantages you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a\r single dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can.”\r \r No arguments will give courage to the coward.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion\r \r \r THE ASS and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for their\r mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt. They had not\r proceeded far when they met a Lion. The Fox, seeing imminent danger,\r approached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the\r Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not to harm the Fox. Then, upon\r assuring the Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a\r deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing\r that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked\r the Ass at his leisure.\r \r \r \r \r The Flies and the Honey-Pot\r \r \r A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been\r overturned in a housekeeper’s room, and placing their feet in it, ate\r greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that\r they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were\r suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, “O foolish\r creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have\r destroyed ourselves.”\r \r Pleasure bought with pains, hurts.\r \r \r \r \r The Lioness\r \r \r A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of\r the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number\r of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the\r Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. “And you,”\r they said, “how many sons have you at a birth?” The Lioness laughed at\r them, and said: “Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a\r thoroughbred Lion.”\r \r The value is in the worth, not in the number.\r \r \r \r \r The Farmer and the Snake\r \r \r ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had\r compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The Snake\r was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts,\r bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. “Oh,” cried the\r Farmer with his last breath, “I am rightly served for pitying a\r scoundrel.”\r \r The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.\r \r \r \r \r The Man and the Lion\r \r \r A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began\r to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and\r prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone,\r which represented “a Lion strangled by a Man.” The traveler pointed to\r it and said: “See there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over\r even the king of beasts.” The Lion replied: “This statue was made by\r one of you men. If we Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see\r the Man placed under the paw of the Lion.”\r \r One story is good, till another is told.\r \r \r \r \r The Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble\r \r \r THE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the most\r beautiful. When their strife was at its height, a Bramble from the\r neighboring hedge lifted up its voice, and said in a boastful tone:\r “Pray, my dear friends, in my presence at least cease from such vain\r disputings.”\r \r \r \r \r The Farmer and the Stork\r \r \r A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number of\r Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork\r that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the\r Farmer to spare his life. “Pray save me, Master,” he said, “and let me\r go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I\r am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I\r love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers—they\r are not the least like those of a Crane.” The Farmer laughed aloud and\r said, “It may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you\r with these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company.”\r \r Birds of a feather flock together.\r \r \r \r \r The Mountain in Labor\r \r \r A MOUNTAIN was once greatly agitated. Loud groans and noises were\r heard, and crowds of people came from all parts to see what was the\r matter. While they were assembled in anxious expectation of some\r terrible calamity, out came a Mouse.\r \r Don’t make much ado about nothing.\r \r \r \r \r The Bear and the Fox\r \r \r A BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all\r animals he was the most tender in his regard for man, for he had such\r respect for him that he would not even touch his dead body. A Fox\r hearing these words said with a smile to the Bear, “Oh! that you would\r eat the dead and not the living.”\r \r \r \r \r The Tortoise and the Eagle\r \r \r A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of\r her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle, hovering\r near, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him\r if he would take her aloft and float her in the air. “I will give you,”\r she said, “all the riches of the Red Sea.” “I will teach you to fly\r then,” said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her\r almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty\r mountain, dashing her shell to pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the\r moment of death: “I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do\r with wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the\r earth?”\r \r If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined.\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Goat\r \r \r A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.\r A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the\r Fox, inquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a\r merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying\r it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The\r Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just\r as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in\r and suggested a scheme for their common escape. “If,” said he, “you\r will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run\r up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat\r readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself\r with the Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made\r off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his\r promise, he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If\r you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard,\r you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor\r have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of\r escape.”\r \r Look before you leap.\r \r \r \r \r The Raven and the Swan\r \r \r A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful\r plumage. Supposing that the Swan’s splendid white color arose from his\r washing in the water in which he swam, the Raven left the altars in the\r neighborhood where he picked up his living, and took up residence in\r the lakes and pools. But cleansing his feathers as often as he would,\r he could not change their color, while through want of food he\r perished.\r \r Change of habit cannot alter Nature.\r \r \r \r \r The Thirsty Pigeon\r \r \r A PIGEON, oppressed by excessive thirst, saw a goblet of water painted\r on a signboard. Not supposing it to be only a picture, she flew towards\r it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed against the signboard,\r jarring herself terribly. Having broken her wings by the blow, she fell\r to the ground, and was caught by one of the bystanders.\r \r Zeal should not outrun discretion.\r \r \r \r \r The Dog in the Manger\r \r \r A DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented the\r oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them. “What a\r selfish Dog!” said one of them to his companions; “he cannot eat the\r hay himself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat who can.”\r \r \r \r \r The Oxen and the Axle-Trees\r \r \r A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen.\r The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen,\r turning round, thus addressed the wheels: “Hullo there! why do you make\r so much noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry\r out.”\r \r Those who suffer most cry out the least.\r \r \r \r \r The Farmer and the Cranes\r \r \r SOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown\r with wheat. For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling,\r chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found\r that the sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any\r notice of it and would not move. The Farmer, on seeing this, charged\r his sling with stones, and killed a great number. The remaining birds\r at once forsook his fields, crying to each other, “It is time for us to\r be off to Liliput: for this man is no longer content to scare us, but\r begins to show us in earnest what he can do.”\r \r If words suffice not, blows must follow.\r \r \r \r \r The Sick Lion\r \r \r A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with\r food by force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned to his den,\r and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his\r sickness should be publicly known. The beasts expressed their sorrow,\r and came one by one to his den, where the Lion devoured them. After\r many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick\r and presenting himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave,\r at a respectful distance, and asked him how he was. “I am very\r middling,” replied the Lion, “but why do you stand without? Pray enter\r within to talk with me.” “No, thank you,” said the Fox. “I notice that\r there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no trace of\r any returning.”\r \r He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others.\r \r \r \r \r The Bear and the Two Travelers\r \r \r TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their\r path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself\r in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat\r on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout,\r and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance\r of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is said he\r will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler\r descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it\r was the Bear had whispered in his ear. “He gave me this advice,” his\r companion replied. “Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the\r approach of danger.”\r \r Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.\r \r \r \r \r The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail\r \r \r A FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail.\r Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to\r which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that\r being tailless was much more attractive, thus making up for his own\r deprivation. He assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them\r to cut off their tails, saying that they would not only look much\r better without them, but that they would get rid of the weight of the\r brush, which was a very great inconvenience. One of them interrupting\r him said, “If you had not yourself lost your tail, my friend, you would\r not thus counsel us.”\r \r \r \r \r The Cat and the Cock\r \r \r A CAT caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a reasonable excuse\r for eating him. He accused him of being a nuisance to men by crowing in\r the nighttime and not permitting them to sleep. The Cock defended\r himself by saying that he did this for the benefit of men, that they\r might rise in time for their labours. The Cat replied, “Although you\r abound in specious apologies, I shall not remain supperless;” and he\r made a meal of him.\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing\r \r \r ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his appearance in order to\r secure food more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he pastured\r with the flock deceiving the shepherd by his costume. In the evening he\r was shut up by the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, and the\r entrance made thoroughly secure. But the shepherd, returning to the\r fold during the night to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly\r caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and killed him instantly.\r \r Harm seek, harm find.\r \r \r \r \r The Goat and the Goatherd\r \r \r A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He\r whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention\r to the summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its\r horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied, “Why,\r you silly fellow, the horn will speak though I be silent.”\r \r Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.\r \r \r \r \r The Boasting Traveler\r \r \r A MAN who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on returning\r to his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic feats he had\r performed in the different places he had visited. Among other things,\r he said that when he was at Rhodes he had leaped to such a distance\r that no man of his day could leap anywhere near him as to that, there\r were in Rhodes many persons who saw him do it and whom he could call as\r witnesses. One of the bystanders interrupted him, saying: “Now, my good\r man, if this be all true there is no need of witnesses. Suppose this to\r be Rhodes, and leap for us.”\r \r \r \r \r The Lion in Love\r \r \r A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The Father,\r unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon this\r expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He expressed his\r willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one\r condition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off\r his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both. The Lion\r cheerfully assented to the proposal. But when the toothless, clawless\r Lion returned to repeat his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set\r upon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest.\r \r \r \r \r The Miser\r \r \r A MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried\r in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at\r daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and\r decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the\r hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole\r it. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to\r tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him\r overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, “Pray do not grieve\r so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that\r the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service;\r for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the\r slightest use of it.”\r \r \r \r \r The Porker, the Sheep, and the Goat\r \r \r A young Pig was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a Sheep. On one\r occasion the shepherd laid hold of him, when he grunted, and squeaked,\r and resisted violently. The Sheep and the Goat complained of his\r distressing cries, and said, “He often handles us, and we do not cry\r out.” To this he replied, “Your handling and mine are very different\r things. He catches you only for your wool, or your milk, but he lays\r hold on me for my very life.”\r \r \r \r \r The Boy and the Filberts\r \r \r A BOY put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped as many\r as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out his hand, he\r was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher. Unwilling to\r lose his filberts, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into\r tears and bitterly lamented his disappointment. A bystander said to\r him, “Be satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw\r out your hand.”\r \r Do not attempt too much at once.\r \r \r \r \r The Frogs Asking for a King\r \r \r THE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors to\r Jupiter entreating for a King. Perceiving their simplicity, he cast\r down a huge log into the lake. The Frogs were terrified at the splash\r occasioned by its fall and hid themselves in the depths of the pool.\r But as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they\r swam again to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up,\r and began squatting on it in contempt. After some time they began to\r think themselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler,\r and sent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over\r them another sovereign. He then gave them an Eel to govern them. When\r the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time\r to Jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another King. Jupiter,\r displeased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed upon the\r Frogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon the lake.\r \r \r \r \r The Laborer and the Snake\r \r \r A SNAKE, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage,\r inflicted a mortal bite on the Cottager’s infant son. Grieving over his\r loss, the Father resolved to kill the Snake. The next day, when it came\r out of its hole for food, he took up his axe, but by swinging too\r hastily, missed its head and cut off only the end of its tail. After\r some time the Cottager, afraid that the Snake would bite him also,\r endeavored to make peace, and placed some bread and salt in the hole.\r The Snake, slightly hissing, said: “There can henceforth be no peace\r between us; for whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my\r tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your\r son.”\r \r No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the\r injury.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox\r \r \r A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer’s day, fell fast asleep in his\r den. A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers.\r He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched every corner\r of his den to find the Mouse. A Fox seeing him said: “A fine Lion you\r are, to be frightened of a Mouse.” “’Tis not the Mouse I fear,” said\r the Lion; “I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding.”\r \r Little liberties are great offenses.\r \r \r \r \r The Horse and Groom\r \r \r A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his\r Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own\r profit. “Alas!” said the Horse, “if you really wish me to be in good\r condition, you should groom me less, and feed me more.”\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and the Mule\r \r \r A MULETEER set forth on a journey, driving before him an Ass and a\r Mule, both well laden. The Ass, as long as he traveled along the plain,\r carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep path\r of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he could bear. He\r entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he\r might carry home the rest; but the Mule paid no attention to the\r request. The Ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden.\r Not knowing what else to do in so wild a region, the Muleteer placed\r upon the Mule the load carried by the Ass in addition to his own, and\r at the top of all placed the hide of the Ass, after he had skinned him.\r The Mule, groaning beneath his heavy burden, said to himself: “I am\r treated according to my deserts. If I had only been willing to assist\r the Ass a little in his need, I should not now be bearing, together\r with his burden, himself as well.”\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and the Lapdog\r \r \r A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. The Ass\r was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any\r other Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favourite\r with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine\r without bringing him home some tidbit to eat. The Ass, on the contrary,\r had much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from\r the forest or burdens from the farm. He often lamented his own hard\r fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till\r at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his\r master’s house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and\r fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump about his master as\r he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the\r dishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and\r jumped upon his back. The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and\r perceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove\r out the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as\r he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: “I have\r brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to labor\r with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day like that\r useless little Lapdog!”\r \r \r \r \r The Oxen and the Butchers\r \r \r THE OXEN once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, who practiced\r a trade destructive to their race. They assembled on a certain day to\r carry out their purpose, and sharpened their horns for the contest. But\r one of them who was exceedingly old (for many a field had he plowed)\r thus spoke: “These Butchers, it is true, slaughter us, but they do so\r with skillful hands, and with no unnecessary pain. If we get rid of\r them, we shall fall into the hands of unskillful operators, and thus\r suffer a double death: for you may be assured, that though all the\r Butchers should perish, yet will men never want beef.”\r \r Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another.\r \r \r \r \r The Shepherd’s Boy and the Wolf\r \r \r A SHEPHERD-BOY, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought\r out the villagers three or four times by crying out, “Wolf! Wolf!” and\r when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains.\r The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really\r alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: “Pray, do come and help me; the\r Wolf is killing the sheep;” but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor\r rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his\r leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.\r \r There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.\r \r \r \r \r The Boys and the Frogs\r \r \r SOME BOYS, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the water and\r began to pelt them with stones. They killed several of them, when one\r of the Frogs, lifting his head out of the water, cried out: “Pray stop,\r my boys: what is sport to you, is death to us.”\r \r \r \r \r The Salt Merchant and His Ass\r \r \r A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road home lay\r across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step, fell by\r accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the\r water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his\r panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again\r to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and,\r regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed\r triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw\r through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast, where\r he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing\r the fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the\r sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. And\r thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his back a double\r burden.\r \r \r \r \r The Mischievous Dog\r \r \r A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and to\r bite them without notice. His master suspended a bell about his neck so\r that the Dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went.\r Thinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog grew proud of his bell and\r went tinkling it all over the marketplace. One day an old hound said to\r him: “Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that\r you carry is not, believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a\r mark of disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill\r mannered dog.”\r \r Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.\r \r \r \r \r The Goatherd and the Wild Goats\r \r \r A GOATHERD, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide, found\r some Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his\r own for the night. The next day it snowed very hard, so that he could\r not take the herd to their usual feeding places, but was obliged to\r keep them in the fold. He gave his own goats just sufficient food to\r keep them alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of\r enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own. When the\r thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered\r away as fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd scolded them\r for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had\r taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them, turning\r about, said to him: “That is the very reason why we are so cautious;\r for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so\r long, it is plain also that if others came after us, you would in the\r same manner prefer them to ourselves.”\r \r Old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones.\r \r \r \r \r The Man and His Two Sweethearts\r \r \r A MIDDLE-AGED MAN, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two women\r at the same time. One of them was young, and the other well advanced in\r years. The elder woman, ashamed to be courted by a man younger than\r herself, made a point, whenever her admirer visited her, to pull out\r some portion of his black hairs. The younger, on the contrary, not\r wishing to become the wife of an old man, was equally zealous in\r removing every gray hair she could find. Thus it came to pass that\r between them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his\r head.\r \r Those who seek to please everybody please nobody.\r \r \r \r \r The Sick Stag\r \r \r A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. His\r companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, and each\r one helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his\r use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of\r the means of living.\r \r Evil companions bring more hurt than profit.\r \r \r \r \r The Boy and the Nettles\r \r \r A BOY was stung by a Nettle. He ran home and told his Mother, saying,\r “Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently.” “That was\r just why it stung you,” said his Mother. “The next time you touch a\r Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and\r not in the least hurt you.”\r \r Whatever you do, do with all your might.\r \r \r \r \r The Astronomer\r \r \r AN ASTRONOMER used to go out at night to observe the stars. One\r evening, as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention\r fixed on the sky, he fell accidentally into a deep well. While he\r lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises, and cried loudly for help,\r a neighbor ran to the well, and learning what had happened said: “Hark\r ye, old fellow, why, in striving to pry into what is in heaven, do you\r not manage to see what is on earth?”\r \r \r \r \r The Wolves and the Sheep\r \r \r “WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between us?” said\r the Wolves to the Sheep. “Those evil-disposed Dogs have much to answer\r for. They always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before we\r have done any harm. If you would only dismiss them from your heels,\r there might soon be treaties of peace and reconciliation between us.”\r The Sheep, poor silly creatures, were easily beguiled and dismissed the\r Dogs, whereupon the Wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own\r pleasure.\r \r \r \r \r The Cat and the Birds\r \r \r A CAT, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing dressed\r himself up as a physician, and, taking his cane and a bag of\r instruments becoming his profession, went to call on them. He knocked\r at the door and inquired of the inmates how they all did, saying that\r if they were ill, he would be happy to prescribe for them and cure\r them. They replied, “We are all very well, and shall continue so, if\r you will only be good enough to go away, and leave us as we are.”\r \r \r \r \r The Vain Jackdaw\r \r \r JUPITER DETERMINED, it is said, to create a sovereign over the birds,\r and made proclamation that on a certain day they should all present\r themselves before him, when he would himself choose the most beautiful\r among them to be king. The Jackdaw, knowing his own ugliness, searched\r through the woods and fields, and collected the feathers which had\r fallen from the wings of his companions, and stuck them in all parts of\r his body, hoping thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all.\r When the appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before\r Jupiter, the Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many feathered\r finery. But when Jupiter proposed to make him king because of the\r beauty of his plumage, the birds indignantly protested, and each\r plucked from him his own feathers, leaving the Jackdaw nothing but a\r Jackdaw.\r \r \r \r \r The Kid and the Wolf\r \r \r A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm’s way, saw a Wolf\r passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. The Wolf,\r looking up, said, “Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest\r me, but the roof on which thou art standing.”\r \r Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the strong.\r \r \r \r \r The Old Woman and the Physician\r \r \r AN OLD WOMAN having lost the use of her eyes, called in a Physician to\r heal them, and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses:\r that if he should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum\r of money; but if her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing.\r This agreement being made, the Physician, time after time, applied his\r salve to her eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all\r her property little by little. And when he had got all she had, he\r healed her and demanded the promised payment. The Old Woman, when she\r recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her house, would give\r him nothing. The Physician insisted on his claim, and, as she still\r refused, summoned her before the Judge. The Old Woman, standing up in\r the Court, argued: “This man here speaks the truth in what he says; for\r I did promise to give him a sum of money if I should recover my sight:\r but if I continued blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he declares\r that I am healed. I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for\r when I lost the use of my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and\r valuable goods: but now, though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I\r am not able to see a single thing in it.”\r \r \r \r \r The Ox and the Frog\r \r \r AN OX drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and crushed one\r of them to death. The Mother coming up, and missing one of her sons,\r inquired of his brothers what had become of him. “He is dead, dear\r Mother; for just now a very huge beast with four great feet came to the\r pool and crushed him to death with his cloven heel.” The Frog, puffing\r herself out, inquired, “if the beast was as big as that in size.”\r “Cease, Mother, to puff yourself out,” said her son, “and do not be\r angry; for you would, I assure you, sooner burst than successfully\r imitate the hugeness of that monster.”\r \r \r \r \r The Farmer and His Sons\r \r \r A FATHER, being on the point of death, wished to be sure that his sons\r would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had given it.\r He called them to his bedside and said, “My sons, there is a great\r treasure hid in one of my vineyards.” The sons, after his death, took\r their spades and mattocks and carefully dug over every portion of their\r land. They found no treasure, but the vines repaid their labor by an\r extraordinary and superabundant crop.\r \r \r \r \r The Heifer and the Ox\r \r \r A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and tormented him\r with reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor.\r Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival, the owner released the Ox\r from his yoke, but bound the Heifer with cords and led him away to the\r altar to be slain in honour of the occasion. The Ox saw what was being\r done, and said with a smile to the Heifer: “For this you were allowed\r to live in idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle\r \r \r TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard.\r One at last put the other to flight. The vanquished Cock skulked away\r and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the conqueror, flying up to a\r high wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might.\r An Eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off\r in his talons. The vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner,\r and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery.\r \r Pride goes before destruction.\r \r \r \r \r The Charger and the Miller\r \r \r A CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a mill\r instead of going out to battle. But when he was compelled to grind\r instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change of fortune and\r called to mind his former state, saying, “Ah! Miller, I had indeed to\r go campaigning before, but I was barbed from counter to tail, and a man\r went along to groom me; and now I cannot understand what ailed me to\r prefer the mill before the battle.” “Forbear,” said the Miller to him,\r “harping on what was of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to\r sustain the ups and downs of fortune.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Monkey\r \r \r A MONKEY once danced in an assembly of the Beasts, and so pleased them\r all by his performance that they elected him their King. A Fox, envying\r him the honour, discovered a piece of meat lying in a trap, and leading\r the Monkey to the place where it was, said that she had found a store,\r but had not used it, she had kept it for him as treasure trove of his\r kingdom, and counseled him to lay hold of it. The Monkey approached\r carelessly and was caught in the trap; and on his accusing the Fox of\r purposely leading him into the snare, she replied, “O Monkey, and are\r you, with such a mind as yours, going to be King over the Beasts?”\r \r \r \r \r The Horse and His Rider\r \r \r A HORSE SOLDIER took the utmost pains with his charger. As long as the\r war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper in all emergencies\r and fed him carefully with hay and corn. But when the war was over, he\r only allowed him chaff to eat and made him carry heavy loads of wood,\r subjecting him to much slavish drudgery and ill-treatment. War was\r again proclaimed, however, and when the trumpet summoned him to his\r standard, the Soldier put on his charger its military trappings, and\r mounted, being clad in his heavy coat of mail. The Horse fell down\r straightway under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said\r to his master, “You must now go to the war on foot, for you have\r transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; and how can you expect that I\r can again turn in a moment from an Ass to a Horse?”\r \r \r \r \r The Belly and the Members\r \r \r THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, “Why\r should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while\r you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and\r self-indulgence?” The Members carried out their resolve and refused\r their assistance to the Belly. The whole Body quickly became\r debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and eyes, when too late,\r repented of their folly.\r \r \r \r \r The Widow and Her Little Maidens\r \r \r A WIDOW who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to wait on her.\r She was in the habit of waking them early in the morning, at cockcrow.\r The maidens, aggravated by such excessive labor, resolved to kill the\r cock who roused their mistress so early. When they had done this, they\r found that they had only prepared for themselves greater troubles, for\r their mistress, no longer hearing the hour from the cock, woke them up\r to their work in the middle of the night.\r \r \r \r \r The Vine and the Goat\r \r \r A VINE was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes. A\r Goat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves. The Vine\r addressed him and said: “Why do you thus injure me without a cause, and\r crop my leaves? Is there no young grass left? But I shall not have to\r wait long for my just revenge; for if you now should crop my leaves,\r and cut me down to my root, I shall provide the wine to pour over you\r when you are led as a victim to the sacrifice.”\r \r \r \r \r Jupiter and the Monkey\r \r \r JUPITER ISSUED a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest and\r promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be deemed the\r handsomest. The Monkey came with the rest and presented, with all a\r mother’s tenderness, a flat-nosed, hairless, ill-featured young Monkey\r as a candidate for the promised reward. A general laugh saluted her on\r the presentation of her son. She resolutely said, “I know not whether\r Jupiter will allot the prize to my son, but this I do know, that he is\r at least in the eyes of me his mother, the dearest, handsomest, and\r most beautiful of all.”\r \r \r \r \r The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons\r \r \r THE PIGEONS, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon the\r Hawk to defend them. He at once consented. When they had admitted him\r into the cote, they found that he made more havoc and slew a larger\r number of them in one day than the Kite could pounce upon in a whole\r year.\r \r Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease.\r \r \r \r \r The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat\r \r \r THE DOLPHINS and Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the\r battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and\r said that he would reconcile their differences if they would accept him\r as an umpire. One of the Dolphins replied, “We would far rather be\r destroyed in our battle with each other than admit any interference\r from you in our affairs.”\r \r \r \r \r The Swallow, the Serpent, and the Court of Justice\r \r \r A SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling with\r men, built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of Justice and there\r hatched seven young birds. A Serpent gliding past the nest from its\r hole in the wall ate up the young unfledged nestlings. The Swallow,\r finding her nest empty, lamented greatly and exclaimed: “Woe to me a\r stranger! that in this place where all others’ rights are protected, I\r alone should suffer wrong.”\r \r \r \r \r The Two Pots\r \r \r A RIVER carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of earthenware\r and the other of brass. The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, “Pray\r keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch me ever so\r slightly, I shall be broken in pieces, and besides, I by no means wish\r to come near you.”\r \r Equals make the best friends.\r \r \r \r \r The Shepherd and the Wolf\r \r \r A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up, and after\r a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring flocks. The Wolf,\r having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the Shepherd, “Since you\r have taught me to steal, you must keep a sharp lookout, or you will\r lose some of your own flock.”\r \r \r \r \r The Crab and Its Mother\r \r \r A CRAB said to her son, “Why do you walk so one-sided, my child? It is\r far more becoming to go straight forward.” The young Crab replied:\r “Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the straight way, I\r will promise to walk in it.” The Mother tried in vain, and submitted\r without remonstrance to the reproof of her child.\r \r Example is more powerful than precept.\r \r \r \r \r The Father and His Two Daughters\r \r \r A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the other\r to a tile-maker. After a time he went to the daughter who had married\r the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all things went with\r her. She said, “All things are prospering with me, and I have only one\r wish, that there may be a heavy fall of rain, in order that the plants\r may be well watered.” Not long after, he went to the daughter who had\r married the tilemaker, and likewise inquired of her how she fared; she\r replied, “I want for nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry\r weather may continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the\r bricks might be dried.” He said to her, “If your sister wishes for\r rain, and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my\r wishes?”\r \r \r \r \r The Thief and His Mother\r \r \r A BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and took it\r home to his Mother. She not only abstained from beating him, but\r encouraged him. He next time stole a cloak and brought it to her, and\r she again commended him. The Youth, advanced to adulthood, proceeded to\r steal things of still greater value. At last he was caught in the very\r act, and having his hands bound behind him, was led away to the place\r of public execution. His Mother followed in the crowd and violently\r beat her breast in sorrow, whereupon the young man said, “I wish to say\r something to my Mother in her ear.” She came close to him, and he\r quickly seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off. The Mother\r upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he replied, “Ah! if you\r had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you that lesson-book, I\r should not have come to this, nor have been thus led to a disgraceful\r death.”\r \r \r \r \r The Old Man and Death\r \r \r AN OLD MAN was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and, in carrying\r the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very wearied with his\r long journey. He sat down by the wayside, and throwing down his load,\r besought “Death” to come. “Death” immediately appeared in answer to his\r summons and asked for what reason he had called him. The Old Man\r hurriedly replied, “That, lifting up the load, you may place it again\r upon my shoulders.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fir-Tree and the Bramble\r \r \r A FIR-TREE said boastingly to the Bramble, “You are useful for nothing\r at all; while I am everywhere used for roofs and houses.” The Bramble\r answered: “You poor creature, if you would only call to mind the axes\r and saws which are about to hew you down, you would have reason to wish\r that you had grown up a Bramble, not a Fir-Tree.”\r \r Better poverty without care, than riches with.\r \r \r \r \r The Æthiop\r \r \r THE PURCHASER of a black servant was persuaded that the color of his\r skin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his former\r masters. On bringing him home he resorted to every means of cleaning,\r and subjected the man to incessant scrubbings. The servant caught a\r severe cold, but he never changed his color or complexion.\r \r What’s bred in the bone will stick to the flesh.\r \r \r \r \r The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk\r \r \r A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed an\r intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the most part in the\r water. The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the foot of the\r Mouse tightly to his own. Thus joined together, the Frog first of all\r led his friend the Mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to\r find their food. After this, he gradually led him towards the pool in\r which he lived, until reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in,\r dragging the Mouse with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and\r swam croaking about, as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy Mouse\r was soon suffocated by the water, and his dead body floated about on\r the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog. A Hawk observed it, and,\r pouncing upon it with his talons, carried it aloft. The Frog, being\r still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also carried off a\r prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.\r \r Harm hatch, harm catch.\r \r \r \r \r The Fisherman and His Nets\r \r \r A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast and\r captured a great haul of fish. He managed by a skillful handling of his\r net to retain all the large fish and to draw them to the shore; but he\r could not prevent the smaller fish from falling back through the meshes\r of the net into the sea.\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Sheep\r \r \r A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed in his\r lair. Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was passing, and\r asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing close beside him.\r “For,” he said, “if you will bring me drink, I will find means to\r provide myself with meat.” “Yes,” said the Sheep, “if I should bring\r you the draught, you would doubtless make me provide the meat also.”\r \r Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through.\r \r \r \r \r The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar\r \r \r AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime old\r wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its former\r contents. She greedily placed it several times to her nose, and drawing\r it backwards and forwards said, “O most delicious! How nice must the\r Wine itself have been, when it leaves behind in the very vessel which\r contained it so sweet a perfume!”\r \r The memory of a good deed lives.\r \r \r \r \r The Man Bitten by a Dog\r \r \r A MAN who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of someone who\r might heal him. A friend, meeting him and learning what he wanted,\r said, “If you would be cured, take a piece of bread, and dip it in the\r blood from your wound, and go and give it to the Dog that bit you.” The\r Man who had been bitten laughed at this advice and said, “Why? If I\r should do so, it would be as if I should beg every Dog in the town to\r bite me.”\r \r Benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of\r injuring you.\r \r \r \r \r The Huntsman and the Fisherman\r \r \r A HUNTSMAN, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by chance\r with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with fish.\r The Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their owner experienced an\r equal longing for the contents of the game-bag. They quickly agreed to\r exchange the produce of their day’s sport. Each was so well pleased\r with his bargain that they made for some time the same exchange day\r after day. Finally a neighbor said to them, “If you go on in this way,\r you will soon destroy by frequent use the pleasure of your exchange,\r and each will again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport.”\r \r Abstain and enjoy.\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Crow\r \r \r A CROW having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held it in\r her beak. A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat himself, and\r by a wily stratagem succeeded. “How handsome is the Crow,” he\r exclaimed, “in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her\r complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal to her beauty, she would\r deservedly be considered the Queen of Birds!” This he said deceitfully;\r but the Crow, anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice, set\r up a loud caw and dropped the flesh. The Fox quickly picked it up, and\r thus addressed the Crow: “My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but\r your wit is wanting.”\r \r \r \r \r The Widow and the Sheep\r \r \r A CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep. At shearing time, wishing\r to take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared him herself, but\r used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece she sheared the\r flesh. The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, “Why do you hurt me so,\r Mistress? What weight can my blood add to the wool? If you want my\r flesh, there is the butcher, who will kill me in an instant; but if you\r want my fleece and wool, there is the shearer, who will shear and not\r hurt me.”\r \r The least outlay is not always the greatest gain.\r \r \r \r \r The Playful Ass\r \r \r AN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about there,\r broke in the tiling. The owner went up after him and quickly drove him\r down, beating him severely with a thick wooden cudgel. The Ass said,\r “Why, I saw the Monkey do this very thing yesterday, and you all\r laughed heartily, as if it afforded you very great amusement.”\r \r \r \r \r The Stag in the Ox-Stall\r \r \r A STAG, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the danger\r he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and hid himself in a\r shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: “O unhappy\r creature! why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction\r and trust yourself in the house of your enemy?” The Stag replied: “Only\r allow me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some\r favourable opportunity of effecting my escape.” At the approach of the\r evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag;\r and even the farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed\r and failed to notice him. The Stag, congratulating himself on his\r safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly\r helped him in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: “We\r indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other\r yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and\r until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril.” At that\r moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his\r oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried\r out: “Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough\r straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the\r cobwebs away.” While he thus examined everything in turn, he spied the\r tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Then\r summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be seized and\r killed.\r \r \r \r \r The Two Dogs\r \r \r A MAN had two dogs: a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports, and a\r Housedog, taught to watch the house. When he returned home after a good\r day’s sport, he always gave the Housedog a large share of his spoil.\r The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at this, reproached his companion,\r saying, “It is very hard to have all this labor, while you, who do not\r assist in the chase, luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions.” The\r Housedog replied, “Do not blame me, my friend, but find fault with the\r master, who has not taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence\r on the labor of others.”\r \r Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents.\r \r \r \r \r The Wild Ass and the Lion\r \r \r A WILD ASS and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they might\r capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease. The Lion agreed to\r assist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the Wild Ass gave the Lion\r the benefit of his greater speed. When they had taken as many beasts as\r their necessities required, the Lion undertook to distribute the prey,\r and for this purpose divided it into three shares. “I will take the\r first share,” he said, “because I am King: and the second share, as a\r partner with you in the chase: and the third share (believe me) will be\r a source of great evil to you, unless you willingly resign it to me,\r and set off as fast as you can.”\r \r Might makes right.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion and the Dolphin\r \r \r A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of\r the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance, saying that of\r all the animals they ought to be the best friends, since the one was\r the king of beasts on the earth, and the other was the sovereign ruler\r of all the inhabitants of the ocean. The Dolphin gladly consented to\r this request. Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild\r bull, and called on the Dolphin to help him. The Dolphin, though quite\r willing to give him assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by\r any means reach the land. The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin\r replied, “Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while giving\r me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living\r upon the land.”\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle and the Arrow\r \r \r AN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare whom he\r sought to make his prey. An archer, who saw the Eagle from a place of\r concealment, took an accurate aim and wounded him mortally. The Eagle\r gave one look at the arrow that had entered his heart and saw in that\r single glance that its feathers had been furnished by himself. “It is a\r double grief to me,” he exclaimed, “that I should perish by an arrow\r feathered from my own wings.”\r \r \r \r \r The Sick Kite\r \r \r A KITE, sick unto death, said to his mother: “O Mother! do not mourn,\r but at once invoke the gods that my life may be prolonged.” She\r replied, “Alas! my son, which of the gods do you think will pity you?\r Is there one whom you have not outraged by filching from their very\r altars a part of the sacrifice offered up to them?”\r \r We must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help in\r adversity.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion and the Boar\r \r \r ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general thirst among the\r beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a small well to\r drink. They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and\r were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat. When they stopped\r suddenly to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they\r saw some Vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one that\r should fall first. They at once made up their quarrel, saying, “It is\r better for us to make friends, than to become the food of Crows or\r Vultures.”\r \r \r \r \r The Mice in Council\r \r \r THE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best devise means\r of warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy the Cat.\r Among the many plans suggested, the one that found most favour was the\r proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the Cat, so that the Mice, being\r warned by the sound of the tinkling, might run away and hide themselves\r in their holes at his approach. But when the Mice further debated who\r among them should thus “bell the Cat,” there was no one found to do it.\r \r \r \r \r The One-Eyed Doe\r \r \r A DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the edge of\r the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing her greater\r safety. She turned her sound eye towards the land that she might get\r the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter or hound, and her\r injured eye towards the sea, from whence she entertained no\r anticipation of danger. Some boatmen sailing by saw her, and taking a\r successful aim, mortally wounded her. Yielding up her last breath, she\r gasped forth this lament: “O wretched creature that I am! to take such\r precaution against the land, and after all to find this seashore, to\r which I had come for safety, so much more perilous.”\r \r \r \r \r The Mice and the Weasels\r \r \r THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other, in\r which much blood was shed. The Weasels were always the victors. The\r Mice thought that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had\r no leaders set apart from the general army to command them, and that\r they were exposed to dangers from lack of discipline. They therefore\r chose as leaders Mice that were most renowned for their family descent,\r strength, and counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in\r the fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and\r formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was done,\r and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war\r by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads\r with straws, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops.\r Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice,\r who scampered off as fast as they could to their holes. The generals,\r not being able to get in on account of the ornaments on their heads,\r were all captured and eaten by the Weasels.\r \r The more honour the more danger.\r \r \r \r \r The Shepherd and the Sea\r \r \r A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw the Sea\r very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a view to\r commerce. He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo of dates, and\r set sail. But a very great tempest came on, and the ship being in\r danger of sinking, he threw all his merchandise overboard, and barely\r escaped with his life in the empty ship. Not long afterwards when\r someone passed by and observed the unruffled calm of the Sea, he\r interrupted him and said, “It is again in want of dates, and therefore\r looks quiet.”\r \r \r \r \r The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion\r \r \r AN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion, desperate\r from hunger, approached the spot. He was about to spring upon the Ass,\r when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice the Lion, it is said, has a\r singular aversion) crowed loudly, and the Lion fled away as fast as he\r could. The Ass, observing his trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock\r summoned courage to attack him, and galloped after him for that\r purpose. He had run no long distance, when the Lion, turning about,\r seized him and tore him to pieces.\r \r False confidence often leads into danger.\r \r \r \r \r The Rivers and the Sea\r \r \r THE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, “Why is it\r that when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet, you work in us\r such a change, and make us salty and unfit to drink?” The Sea,\r perceiving that they intended to throw the blame on him, said, “Pray\r cease to flow into me, and then you will not be made briny.”\r \r \r \r \r The Wild Boar and the Fox\r \r \r A WILD BOAR stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the trunk.\r A Fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his teeth when there\r was no danger threatening from either huntsman or hound. He replied, “I\r do it advisedly; for it would never do to have to sharpen my weapons\r just at the time I ought to be using them.”\r \r To be well prepared for war is the best guarantee of peace.\r \r \r \r \r The Milk-Woman and Her Pail\r \r \r A FARMER’S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field to the\r farmhouse, when she fell a-musing. “The money for which this milk will\r be sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. The eggs, allowing for\r all mishaps, will produce two hundred and fifty chickens. The chickens\r will become ready for the market when poultry will fetch the highest\r price, so that by the end of the year I shall have money enough from my\r share to buy a new gown. In this dress I will go to the Christmas\r parties, where all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will\r toss my head and refuse them every one.” At this moment she tossed her\r head in unison with her thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the\r ground, and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.\r \r \r \r \r The Bee and Jupiter\r \r \r A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to Olympus\r to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. Jupiter, delighted\r with the offering of honey, promised to give whatever she should ask.\r She therefore besought him, saying, “Give me, I pray thee, a sting,\r that if any mortal shall approach to take my honey, I may kill him.”\r Jupiter was much displeased, for he loved the race of man, but could\r not refuse the request because of his promise. He thus answered the\r Bee: “You shall have your request, but it will be at the peril of your\r own life. For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you\r make, and then you will die from the loss of it.”\r \r Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Housedog\r \r \r A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about his\r neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet compelled him to\r drag that heavy log about wherever he went. “The master,” he replied.\r Then said the Wolf: “May no friend of mine ever be in such a plight;\r for the weight of this chain is enough to spoil the appetite.”\r \r \r \r \r The Three Tradesmen\r \r \r A GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called together to\r consider the best means of protecting it from the enemy. A Bricklayer\r earnestly recommended bricks as affording the best material for an\r effective resistance. A Carpenter, with equal enthusiasm, proposed\r timber as a preferable method of defense. Upon which a Currier stood up\r and said, “Sirs, I differ from you altogether: there is no material for\r resistance equal to a covering of hides; and nothing so good as\r leather.”\r \r Every man for himself.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass Carrying the Image\r \r \r AN ASS once carried through the streets of a city a famous wooden\r Image, to be placed in one of its Temples. As he passed along, the\r crowd made lowly prostration before the Image. The Ass, thinking that\r they bowed their heads in token of respect for himself, bristled up\r with pride, gave himself airs, and refused to move another step. The\r driver, seeing him thus stop, laid his whip lustily about his shoulders\r and said, “O you perverse dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that\r men pay worship to an Ass.”\r \r They are not wise who give to themselves the credit due to others.\r \r \r \r \r The Master and His Dogs\r \r \r A CERTAIN MAN, detained by a storm in his country house, first of all\r killed his sheep, and then his goats, for the maintenance of his\r household. The storm still continuing, he was obliged to slaughter his\r yoke oxen for food. On seeing this, his Dogs took counsel together, and\r said, “It is time for us to be off, for if the master spare not his\r oxen, who work for his gain, how can we expect him to spare us?”\r \r He is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family.\r \r \r \r \r The Old Hound\r \r \r A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to\r any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the\r chase. He seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold\r because of the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped. His\r master, quickly coming up, was very much disappointed, and fiercely\r abused the dog. The Hound looked up and said, “It was not my fault\r master: my spirit was as good as ever, but I could not help my\r infirmities. I rather deserve to be praised for what I have been, than\r to be blamed for what I am.”\r \r \r \r \r The Two Travelers and the Axe\r \r \r TWO MEN were journeying together. One of them picked up an axe that lay\r upon the path, and said, “I have found an axe.” “Nay, my friend,”\r replied the other, “do not say ‘I,’ but ‘We’ have found an axe.” They\r had not gone far before they saw the owner of the axe pursuing them,\r and he who had picked up the axe said, “We are undone.” “Nay,” replied\r the other, “keep to your first mode of speech, my friend; what you\r thought right then, think right now. Say ‘I,’ not ‘We’ are undone.”\r \r He who shares the danger ought to share the prize.\r \r \r \r \r The Old Lion\r \r \r A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on the\r ground at the point of death. A Boar rushed upon him, and avenged with\r a stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. Shortly afterwards the\r Bull with his horns gored him as if he were an enemy. When the Ass saw\r that the huge beast could be assailed with impunity, he let drive at\r his forehead with his heels. The expiring Lion said, “I have\r reluctantly brooked the insults of the brave, but to be compelled to\r endure such treatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die\r a double death.”\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Shepherds\r \r \r A WOLF, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a haunch of\r mutton for their dinner. Approaching them, he said, “What a clamor you\r would raise if I were to do as you are doing!”\r \r \r \r \r The Seaside Travelers\r \r \r SOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore, climbed to the summit of\r a tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the distance what they\r thought was a large ship. They waited in the hope of seeing it enter\r the harbor, but as the object on which they looked was driven nearer to\r shore by the wind, they found that it could at the most be a small\r boat, and not a ship. When however it reached the beach, they\r discovered that it was only a large faggot of sticks, and one of them\r said to his companions, “We have waited for no purpose, for after all\r there is nothing to see but a load of wood.”\r \r Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and His Shadow\r \r \r A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place. The day being\r intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the Traveler\r stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under the Shadow of\r the Ass. As this afforded only protection for one, and as the Traveler\r and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a violent dispute arose\r between them as to which of them had the right to the Shadow. The owner\r maintained that he had let the Ass only, and not his Shadow. The\r Traveler asserted that he had, with the hire of the Ass, hired his\r Shadow also. The quarrel proceeded from words to blows, and while the\r men fought, the Ass galloped off.\r \r In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and His Masters\r \r \r AN ASS, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food and\r too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from his\r present service and provided with another master. Jupiter, after\r warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to be sold to\r a tile-maker. Shortly afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to\r carry and harder work in the brick-field, he petitioned for another\r change of master. Jupiter, telling him that it would be the last time\r that he could grant his request, ordained that he be sold to a tanner.\r The Ass found that he had fallen into worse hands, and noting his\r master’s occupation, said, groaning: “It would have been better for me\r to have been either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by\r the other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my present\r owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to\r him.”\r \r \r \r \r Mercury and the Sculptor\r \r \r MERCURY once determined to learn in what esteem he was held among\r mortals. For this purpose he assumed the character of a man and visited\r in this disguise a Sculptor’s studio having looked at various statues,\r he demanded the price of two figures of Jupiter and Juno. When the sum\r at which they were valued was named, he pointed to a figure of himself,\r saying to the Sculptor, “You will certainly want much more for this, as\r it is the statue of the Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your\r gain.” The Sculptor replied, “Well, if you will buy these, I’ll fling\r you that into the bargain.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Woodcutter\r \r \r A FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter felling an\r oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place. The Woodcutter\r advised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the Fox crept in and hid\r himself in a corner. The huntsman soon came up with his hounds and\r inquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen the Fox. He declared that he\r had not seen him, and yet pointed, all the time he was speaking, to the\r hut where the Fox lay hidden. The huntsman took no notice of the signs,\r but believing his word, hastened forward in the chase. As soon as they\r were well away, the Fox departed without taking any notice of the\r Woodcutter: whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying, “You\r ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you leave me\r without a word of thanks.” The Fox replied, “Indeed, I should have\r thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good as your words, and\r if your hands had not been traitors to your speech.”\r \r \r \r \r The Oak and the Reeds\r \r \r A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a stream.\r It fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed: “I wonder how you,\r who are so light and weak, are not entirely crushed by these strong\r winds.” They replied, “You fight and contend with the wind, and\r consequently you are destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before\r the least breath of air, and therefore remain unbroken, and escape.”\r \r Stoop to conquer.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion in a Farmyard\r \r \r A LION entered a farmyard. The Farmer, wishing to catch him, shut the\r gate. When the Lion found that he could not escape, he flew upon the\r sheep and killed them, and then attacked the oxen. The Farmer,\r beginning to be alarmed for his own safety, opened the gate and\r released the Lion. On his departure the Farmer grievously lamented the\r destruction of his sheep and oxen, but his wife, who had been a\r spectator to all that took place, said, “On my word, you are rightly\r served, for how could you for a moment think of shutting up a Lion\r along with you in your farmyard when you know that you shake in your\r shoes if you only hear his roar at a distance?”\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Lion\r \r \r A WOLF, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off to his\r lair. A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took it from\r him. Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, “You have\r unrighteously taken that which was mine from me!” To which the Lion\r jeeringly replied, “It was righteously yours, eh? The gift of a\r friend?”\r \r \r \r \r The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock\r \r \r A BIRDCATCHER was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when a friend\r unexpectedly came in. The bird-trap was quite empty, as he had caught\r nothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge, which he had tamed for a\r decoy. The bird entreated earnestly for his life: “What would you do\r without me when next you spread your nets? Who would chirp you to\r sleep, or call for you the covey of answering birds?” The Birdcatcher\r spared his life, and determined to pick out a fine young Cock just\r attaining to his comb. But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from\r his perch: “If you kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of\r the dawn? Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is\r time to visit the bird-trap in the morning?” He replied, “What you say\r is true. You are a capital bird at telling the time of day. But my\r friend and I must have our dinners.”\r \r Necessity knows no law.\r \r \r \r \r The Ant and the Dove\r \r \r AN ANT went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being\r carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning. A\r Dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it\r fall into the stream close to her. The Ant climbed onto it and floated\r in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood\r under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the\r branches. The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. In\r pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the Dove\r take wing.\r \r \r \r \r The Hares and the Frogs\r \r \r THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of the\r perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord determined\r to put an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty\r precipice into a deep lake below. As they scampered off in large\r numbers to carry out their resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks of the\r lake heard the noise of their feet and rushed helter-skelter to the\r deep water for safety. On seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs,\r one of the Hares cried out to his companions: “Stay, my friends, do not\r do as you intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are\r still more timid than ourselves.”\r \r \r \r \r The Monkey and the Fishermen\r \r \r A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting their\r nets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings. The\r Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to dinner\r left their nets upon the bank. The Monkey, who is the most imitative of\r animals, descended from the treetop and endeavored to do as they had\r done. Having handled the net, he threw it into the river, but became\r tangled in the meshes and drowned. With his last breath he said to\r himself, “I am rightly served; for what business had I who had never\r handled a net to try and catch fish?”\r \r \r \r \r The Swan and the Goose\r \r \r A CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan. He fed the\r one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its song. When the\r time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to get him at night,\r when it was dark, and he was not able to distinguish one bird from the\r other. By mistake he caught the Swan instead of the Goose. The Swan,\r threatened with death, burst forth into song and thus made himself\r known by his voice, and preserved his life by his melody.\r \r \r \r \r The Doe and the Lion\r \r \r A DOE hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging to a\r Lion. The Lion concealed himself on seeing her approach, but when she\r was safe within the cave, sprang upon her and tore her to pieces. “Woe\r is me,” exclaimed the Doe, “who have escaped from man, only to throw\r myself into the mouth of a wild beast?”\r \r In avoiding one evil, care must be taken not to fall into another.\r \r \r \r \r The Fisherman and the Little Fish\r \r \r A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a\r single small Fish as the result of his day’s labor. The Fish, panting\r convulsively, thus entreated for his life: “O Sir, what good can I be\r to you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet come to my full size.\r Pray spare my life, and put me back into the sea. I shall soon become a\r large fish fit for the tables of the rich, and then you can catch me\r again, and make a handsome profit of me.” The Fisherman replied, “I\r should indeed be a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater\r uncertain profit, I were to forego my present certain gain.”\r \r \r \r \r The Hunter and the Woodman\r \r \r A HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. He\r asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his\r footsteps or knew where his lair was. “I will,” said the man, “at once\r show you the Lion himself.” The Hunter, turning very pale and\r chattering with his teeth from fear, replied, “No, thank you. I did not\r ask that; it is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion\r himself.”\r \r The hero is brave in deeds as well as words.\r \r \r \r \r The Swollen Fox\r \r \r A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds in the\r hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a hearty meal. When he\r finished, he was so full that he was not able to get out, and began to\r groan and lament his fate. Another Fox passing by heard his cries, and\r coming up, inquired the cause of his complaining. On learning what had\r happened, he said to him, “Ah, you will have to remain there, my\r friend, until you become such as you were when you crept in, and then\r you will easily get out.”\r \r \r \r \r The Two Frogs\r \r \r TWO FROGS dwelt in the same pool. When the pool dried up under the\r summer’s heat, they left it and set out together for another home. As\r they went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply supplied with\r water, and when they saw it, one of the Frogs said to the other, “Let\r us descend and make our abode in this well: it will furnish us with\r shelter and food.” The other replied with greater caution, “But suppose\r the water should fail us. How can we get out again from so great a\r depth?”\r \r Do nothing without a regard to the consequences.\r \r \r \r \r The Lamp\r \r \r A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted that it\r gave more light than the sun. Then a sudden puff of wind arose, and the\r Lamp was immediately extinguished. Its owner lit it again, and said:\r “Boast no more, but henceforth be content to give thy light in silence.\r Know that not even the stars need to be relit.”\r \r \r \r \r The Camel and the Arab\r \r \r AN ARAB Camel-driver, after completing the loading of his Camel, asked\r him which he would like best, to go up hill or down. The poor beast\r replied, not without a touch of reason: “Why do you ask me? Is it that\r the level way through the desert is closed?”\r \r \r \r \r The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass\r \r \r A MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair to\r sell him. They had not gone far when they met with a troop of women\r collected round a well, talking and laughing. “Look there,” cried one\r of them, “did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the road\r on foot when they might ride?” The old man hearing this, quickly made\r his son mount the Ass, and continued to walk along merrily by his side.\r Presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate.\r “There,” said one of them, “it proves what I was a-saying. What respect\r is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding\r while his old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and\r let the old man rest his weary limbs.” Upon this the old man made his\r son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded\r far when they met a company of women and children: “Why, you lazy old\r fellow,” cried several tongues at once, “how can you ride upon the\r beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the\r side of you?” The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son\r behind him. They had now almost reached the town. “Pray, honest\r friend,” said a citizen, “is that Ass your own?” “Yes,” replied the old\r man. “O, one would not have thought so,” said the other, “by the way\r you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor\r beast than he you.” “Anything to please you,” said the old man; “we can\r but try.” So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass\r together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their\r shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. This\r entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till\r the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was\r subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole,\r fell into the river. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made\r the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please\r everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain.\r \r \r \r \r The Cat and the Mice\r \r \r A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made\r her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for\r their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes. The Cat was\r no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them\r forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and\r suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. One of the Mice,\r peeping stealthily out, saw her and said, “Ah, my good madam, even\r though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you.”\r \r \r \r \r The Mouse and the Bull\r \r \r A BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried to\r capture him. But the Mouse reached his hole in safety. Though the Bull\r dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he could rout out\r the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep outside the hole. The\r Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his flank, and again biting him,\r retreated to his hole. The Bull rising up, and not knowing what to do,\r was sadly perplexed. At which the Mouse said, “The great do not always\r prevail. There are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to\r do mischief.”\r \r \r \r \r The Dog and the Cook\r \r \r A RICH MAN gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends and\r acquaintances. His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a\r stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, “My master gives a feast, and\r there is always much food remaining; come and sup with me tonight.” The\r Dog thus invited went at the hour appointed, and seeing the\r preparations for so grand an entertainment, said in the joy of his\r heart, “How glad I am that I came! I do not often get such a chance as\r this. I will take care and eat enough to last me both today and\r tomorrow.” While he was congratulating himself and wagging his tail to\r convey his pleasure to his friend, the Cook saw him moving about among\r his dishes and, seizing him by his fore and hind paws, bundled him\r without ceremony out of the window. He fell with force upon the ground\r and limped away, howling dreadfully. His yelling soon attracted other\r street dogs, who came up to him and inquired how he had enjoyed his\r supper. He replied, “Why, to tell you the truth, I drank so much wine\r that I remember nothing. I do not know how I got out of the house.”\r \r \r \r \r The Thieves and the Cock\r \r \r SOME THIEVES broke into a house and found nothing but a Cock, whom they\r stole, and got off as fast as they could. Upon arriving at home they\r prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life: “Pray spare\r me; I am very serviceable to men. I wake them up in the night to their\r work.” “That is the very reason why we must the more kill you,” they\r replied; “for when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to\r our business.”\r \r The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions.\r \r \r \r \r The Dancing Monkeys\r \r \r A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance. Being naturally great\r mimics of men’s actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils, and\r when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well as\r any of the courtiers. The spectacle was often repeated with great\r applause, till on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from\r his pocket a handful of nuts and threw them upon the stage. The Monkeys\r at the sight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed\r they were) Monkeys instead of actors. Pulling off their masks and\r tearing their robes, they fought with one another for the nuts. The\r dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule\r of the audience.\r \r \r \r \r The Farmer and the Fox\r \r \r A FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his poultry yard,\r caught him at last, and being determined to take an ample revenge, tied\r some rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and set it on fire. The Fox\r by a strange fatality rushed to the fields of the Farmer who had\r captured him. It was the time of the wheat harvest; but the Farmer\r reaped nothing that year and returned home grieving sorely.\r \r \r \r \r The Traveler and Fortune\r \r \r A TRAVELER wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with fatigue,\r on the very brink of a deep well. Just as he was about to fall into the\r water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and waking him from\r his slumber thus addressed him: “Good Sir, pray wake up: for if you\r fall into the well, the blame will be thrown on me, and I shall get an\r ill name among mortals; for I find that men are sure to impute their\r calamities to me, however much by their own folly they have really\r brought them on themselves.”\r \r Everyone is more or less master of his own fate.\r \r \r \r \r The Seagull and the Kite\r \r \r A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep\r gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and\r exclaimed: “You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no\r business to seek its food from the sea.”\r \r Every man should be content to mind his own business.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox\r \r \r A LION and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought fiercely\r for its possession. When they had fearfully lacerated each other and\r were faint from the long combat, they lay down exhausted with fatigue.\r A Fox, who had gone round them at a distance several times, saw them\r both stretched on the ground with the Kid lying untouched in the\r middle. He ran in between them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as\r fast as he could. The Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to\r get up, said, “Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored\r ourselves only to serve the turn of a Fox.”\r \r It sometimes happens that one man has all the toil, and another all the\r profit.\r \r \r \r \r The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury\r \r \r A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel, of\r which the crew and passengers were all drowned. He inveighed against\r the injustice of Providence, which would for the sake of one criminal\r perchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent persons to perish.\r As he was indulging in these reflections, he found himself surrounded\r by a whole army of Ants, near whose nest he was standing. One of them\r climbed up and stung him, and he immediately trampled them all to death\r with his foot. Mercury presented himself, and striking the Philosopher\r with his wand, said, “And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of\r the dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner\r treated these poor Ants?”\r \r \r \r \r The Peasant and the Eagle\r \r \r A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring the\r bird, set him free. The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to his\r deliverer, for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which was not\r safe, he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a bundle from his\r head. When the Peasant rose in pursuit, the Eagle let the bundle fall\r again. Taking it up, the man returned to the same place, to find that\r the wall under which he had been sitting had fallen to pieces; and he\r marveled at the service rendered him by the Eagle.\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Leopard\r \r \r THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of the\r two. The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots which decorated\r his skin. But the Fox, interrupting him, said, “And how much more\r beautiful than you am I, who am decorated, not in body, but in mind.”\r \r \r \r \r The Lion and the Hare\r \r \r A LION came across a Hare, who was fast asleep. He was just in the act\r of seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and he left the Hare\r to follow him. The Hare, scared by the noise, awoke and scudded away.\r The Lion was unable after a long chase to catch the Hart, and returned\r to feed upon the Hare. On finding that the Hare also had run off, he\r said, “I am rightly served, for having let go of the food that I had in\r my hand for the chance of obtaining more.”\r \r \r \r \r The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter\r \r \r A VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of Mercury,\r before which he made offerings day by day, and begged the idol to make\r him rich, but in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer.\r At last, being very angry, he took his image down from its pedestal and\r dashed it against the wall. When its head was knocked off, out came a\r stream of gold, which the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, “Well,\r I think thou art altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I\r paid you honour, I reaped no benefits: but now that I maltreat you I am\r loaded with an abundance of riches.”\r \r \r \r \r The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass\r \r \r THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each\r other in the chase. Having secured a large booty, the Lion on their\r return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due portion to each\r of the three partners in the treaty. The Ass carefully divided the\r spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to\r make the first choice. The Lion, bursting out into a great rage,\r devoured the Ass. Then he requested the Fox to do him the favour to\r make a division. The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one\r large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion\r said, “Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of\r division? You are perfect to a fraction.” He replied, “I learned it\r from the Ass, by witnessing his fate.”\r \r Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others.\r \r \r \r \r The Bull and the Goat\r \r \r A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds had\r recently occupied. As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in the cave\r sharply attacked him with his horns. The Bull quietly addressed him:\r “Butt away as much as you will. I have no fear of you, but of the Lion.\r Let that monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the\r respective strength of a Goat and a Bull.”\r \r It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in distress.\r \r \r \r \r The Bald Knight\r \r \r A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt. A sudden puff of wind\r blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang forth from his\r companions. He pulled up his horse, and with great glee joined in the\r joke by saying, “What a marvel it is that hairs which are not mine\r should fly from me, when they have forsaken even the man on whose head\r they grew.”\r \r \r \r \r The Oaks and Jupiter\r \r \r THE OAKS presented a complaint to Jupiter, saying, “We bear for no\r purpose the burden of life, as of all the trees that grow we are the\r most continually in peril of the axe.” Jupiter made answer: “You have\r only to thank yourselves for the misfortunes to which you are exposed:\r for if you did not make such excellent pillars and posts, and prove\r yourselves so serviceable to the carpenters and the farmers, the axe\r would not so frequently be laid to your roots.”\r \r \r \r \r The Monkeys and Their Mother\r \r \r THE MONKEY, it is said, has two young ones at each birth. The Mother\r fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care, but\r hates and neglects the other. It happened once that the young one which\r was caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection of the\r Mother, while the despised one was nurtured and reared in spite of the\r neglect to which it was exposed.\r \r The best intentions will not always ensure success.\r \r \r \r \r The Hare and the Hound\r \r \r A HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave up the\r chase. A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying “The little one\r is the best runner of the two.” The Hound replied, “You do not see the\r difference between us: I was only running for a dinner, but he for his\r life.”\r \r \r \r \r The Shepherd and the Dog\r \r \r A SHEPHERD penning his sheep in the fold for the night was about to\r shut up a wolf with them, when his Dog perceiving the wolf said,\r “Master, how can you expect the sheep to be safe if you admit a wolf\r into the fold?”\r \r \r \r \r The Oak and the Woodcutters\r \r \r THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces, making\r wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk. The Oak said with a\r sigh, “I do not care about the blows of the axe aimed at my roots, but\r I do grieve at being torn in pieces by these wedges made from my own\r branches.”\r \r Misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear.\r \r \r \r \r The Wasp and the Snake\r \r \r A WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking him\r unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death. The Snake, being in\r great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his enemy, saw a\r wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and purposely placed his head\r under the wheels, saying, “At least my enemy and I shall perish\r together.”\r \r \r \r \r The Peacock and the Crane\r \r \r A PEACOCK spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that passed by,\r ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying, “I am robed, like a\r king, in gold and purple and all the colors of the rainbow; while you\r have not a bit of color on your wings.” “True,” replied the Crane; “but\r I soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my voice to the stars,\r while you walk below, like a cock, among the birds of the dunghill.”\r \r Fine feathers don’t make fine birds.\r \r \r \r \r The Hen and the Golden Eggs\r \r \r A COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every day.\r They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold in its\r inside, and in order to get the gold they killed it. Having done so,\r they found to their surprise that the Hen differed in no respect from\r their other hens. The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at\r once, deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by\r day.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and the Frogs\r \r \r AN ASS, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond. As he was\r crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and fell, and\r not being able to rise on account of his load, groaned heavily. Some\r Frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation, and said, “What would\r you do if you had to live here always as we do, when you make such a\r fuss about a mere fall into the water?”\r \r Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do large\r misfortunes.\r \r \r \r \r The Crow and the Raven\r \r \r A CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a bird of\r good omen and always attracted the attention of men, who noted by his\r flight the good or evil course of future events. Seeing some travelers\r approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and perching herself on one\r of the branches, cawed as loudly as she could. The travelers turned\r towards the sound and wondered what it foreboded, when one of them said\r to his companion, “Let us proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is\r only the caw of a crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen.”\r \r Those who assume a character which does not belong to them, only make\r themselves ridiculous.\r \r \r \r \r The Trees and the Axe\r \r \r A MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a handle\r for his axe. The Trees consented to his request and gave him a young\r ash-tree. No sooner had the man fitted a new handle to his axe from it,\r than he began to use it and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest\r giants of the forest. An old oak, lamenting when too late the\r destruction of his companions, said to a neighboring cedar, “The first\r step has lost us all. If we had not given up the rights of the ash, we\r might yet have retained our own privileges and have stood for ages.”\r \r \r \r \r The Wolves and the Sheepdogs\r \r \r THE WOLVES thus addressed the Sheepdogs: “Why should you, who are like\r us in so many things, not be entirely of one mind with us, and live\r with us as brothers should? We differ from you in one point only. We\r live in freedom, but you bow down to and slave for men, who in return\r for your services flog you with whips and put collars on your necks.\r They make you also guard their sheep, and while they eat the mutton\r throw only the bones to you. If you will be persuaded by us, you will\r give us the sheep, and we will enjoy them in common, till we all are\r surfeited.” The Dogs listened favourably to these proposals, and,\r entering the den of the Wolves, they were set upon and torn to pieces.\r \r \r \r \r The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter\r \r \r A BULL finding a lion’s cub asleep gored him to death with his horns.\r The Lioness came up, and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp. A\r wild-boar Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a distance and said to\r her, “Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss\r of their children, whose deaths have been caused by you.”\r \r \r \r \r The Bowman and Lion\r \r \r A VERY SKILLFUL BOWMAN went to the mountains in search of game, but all\r the beasts of the forest fled at his approach. The Lion alone\r challenged him to combat. The Bowman immediately shot out an arrow and\r said to the Lion: “I send thee my messenger, that from him thou mayest\r learn what I myself shall be when I assail thee.” The wounded Lion\r rushed away in great fear, and when a Fox who had seen it all happen\r told him to be of good courage and not to back off at the first attack\r he replied: “You counsel me in vain; for if he sends so fearful a\r messenger, how shall I abide the attack of the man himself?”\r \r Be on guard against men who can strike from a distance.\r \r \r \r \r The Camel\r \r \r WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast size\r that he ran away. After a time, perceiving the meekness and gentleness\r of the beast’s temper, he summoned courage enough to approach him. Soon\r afterwards, observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in\r spirit, he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth, and\r to let a child drive him.\r \r Use serves to overcome dread.\r \r \r \r \r The Crab and the Fox\r \r \r A CRAB, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green meadow as its\r feeding ground. A Fox came across him, and being very hungry ate him\r up. Just as he was on the point of being eaten, the Crab said, “I well\r deserve my fate, for what business had I on the land, when by my nature\r and habits I am only adapted for the sea?”\r \r Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and the Old Shepherd\r \r \r A SHEPHERD, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was alarmed all of a\r sudden by the cries of the enemy. He appealed to the Ass to fly with\r him, lest they should both be captured, but the animal lazily replied,\r “Why should I, pray? Do you think it likely the conqueror will place on\r me two sets of panniers?” “No,” rejoined the Shepherd. “Then,” said the\r Ass, “as long as I carry the panniers, what matters it to me whom I\r serve?”\r \r In a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name of\r their master.\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Hedgehog\r \r \r A FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the\r current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time very much\r bruised, sick, and unable to move. A swarm of hungry blood-sucking\r flies settled upon him. A Hedgehog, passing by, saw his anguish and\r inquired if he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him.\r “By no means,” replied the Fox; “pray do not molest them.” “How is\r this?” said the Hedgehog; “do you not want to be rid of them?” “No,”\r returned the Fox, “for these flies which you see are full of blood, and\r sting me but little, and if you rid me of these which are already\r satiated, others more hungry will come in their place, and will drink\r up all the blood I have left.”\r \r \r \r \r The Woman and Her Hen\r \r \r A WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day. She often\r pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of one, and at\r last, to gain her purpose, determined to give the Hen a double\r allowance of barley. From that day the Hen became fat and sleek, and\r never once laid another egg.\r \r \r \r \r The Kites and the Swans\r \r \r TEE KITES of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the privilege of\r song. But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so enchanted\r with the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in trying to neigh,\r they forgot how to sing.\r \r The desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of present\r blessings.\r \r \r \r \r The Dog and the Hare\r \r \r A HOUND having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for some\r distance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her\r life, and at another fawning upon her, as if in play with another dog.\r The Hare said to him, “I wish you would act sincerely by me, and show\r yourself in your true colors. If you are a friend, why do you bite me\r so hard? If an enemy, why do you fawn on me?”\r \r No one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust or distrust\r him.\r \r \r \r \r The Hares and the Foxes\r \r \r THE HARES waged war with the Eagles, and called upon the Foxes to help\r them. They replied, “We would willingly have helped you, if we had not\r known who you were, and with whom you were fighting.”\r \r Count the cost before you commit yourselves.\r \r \r \r \r The Bull and the Calf\r \r \r A BULL was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through a\r narrow passage which led to his stall. A young Calf came up, and\r offered to go before and show him the way by which he could manage to\r pass. “Save yourself the trouble,” said the Bull; “I knew that way long\r before you were born.”\r \r \r \r \r The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep\r \r \r A STAG asked a Sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, and said that the\r Wolf would be his surety. The Sheep, fearing some fraud was intended,\r excused herself, saying, “The Wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants\r and to run off; and you, too, can quickly outstrip me in your rapid\r flight. How then shall I be able to find you, when the day of payment\r comes?”\r \r Two blacks do not make one white.\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow\r \r \r AN EAGLE made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat, having found a\r convenient hole, moved into the middle of the trunk; and a Wild Sow,\r with her young, took shelter in a hollow at its foot. The Cat cunningly\r resolved to destroy this chance-made colony. To carry out her design,\r she climbed to the nest of the Eagle, and said, “Destruction is\r preparing for you, and for me too, unfortunately. The Wild Sow, whom\r you see daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she\r may on its fall seize our families as food for her young.” Having thus\r frightened the Eagle out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of\r the Sow, and said, “Your children are in great danger; for as soon as\r you go out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to\r pounce upon one of your little pigs.” Having instilled these fears into\r the Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the\r tree. When night came she went forth with silent foot and obtained food\r for herself and her kittens, but feigning to be afraid, she kept a\r lookout all through the day. Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the\r Sow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle,\r did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus they both, along with\r their families, perished from hunger, and afforded ample provision for\r the Cat and her kittens.\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Fox\r \r \r AT ONE TIME a very large and strong Wolf was born among the wolves, who\r exceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and swiftness, so\r that they unanimously decided to call him “Lion.” The Wolf, with a lack\r of sense proportioned to his enormous size, thought that they gave him\r this name in earnest, and, leaving his own race, consorted exclusively\r with the lions. An old sly Fox, seeing this, said, “May I never make\r myself so ridiculous as you do in your pride and self-conceit; for even\r though you have the size of a lion among wolves, in a herd of lions you\r are definitely a wolf.”\r \r \r \r \r The Mule\r \r \r A MULE, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn, galloped\r about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself: “My father\r surely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own child in speed and\r spirit.” On the next day, being driven a long journey, and feeling very\r wearied, he exclaimed in a disconsolate tone: “I must have made a\r mistake; my father, after all, could have been only an ass.”\r \r \r \r \r The Prophet\r \r \r A WIZARD, sitting in the marketplace, was telling the fortunes of the\r passers-by when a person ran up in great haste, and announced to him\r that the doors of his house had been broken open and that all his goods\r were being stolen. He sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as he\r could run. A neighbor saw him running and said, “Oh! you fellow there!\r you say you can foretell the fortunes of others; how is it you did not\r foresee your own?”\r \r \r \r \r The Two Frogs\r \r \r TWO FROGS were neighbors. One inhabited a deep pond, far removed from\r public view; the other lived in a gully containing little water, and\r traversed by a country road. The Frog that lived in the pond warned his\r friend to change his residence and entreated him to come and live with\r him, saying that he would enjoy greater safety from danger and more\r abundant food. The other refused, saying that he felt it so very hard\r to leave a place to which he had become accustomed. A few days\r afterwards a heavy wagon passed through the gully and crushed him to\r death under its wheels.\r \r A willful man will have his way to his own hurt.\r \r \r \r \r The Serpent and the Eagle\r \r \r A SERPENT and an Eagle were struggling with each other in deadly\r conflict. The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to strangle the\r bird. A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed the coil of the\r Serpent and let the Eagle go free. The Serpent, irritated at the escape\r of his prey, injected his poison into the drinking horn of the\r countryman. The rustic, ignorant of his danger, was about to drink,\r when the Eagle struck his hand with his wing, and, seizing the drinking\r horn in his talons, carried it aloft.\r \r \r \r \r The Crow and the Pitcher\r \r \r A CROW perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find water,\r flew to it with delight. When he reached it, he discovered to his grief\r that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it.\r He tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his\r efforts were in vain. At last he collected as many stones as he could\r carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until\r he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.\r \r Necessity is the mother of invention.\r \r \r \r \r The Thief and the Innkeeper\r \r \r A THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope of\r stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning. When\r he had waited some days in vain, he saw the Innkeeper dressed in a new\r and handsome coat and sitting before his door. The Thief sat down\r beside him and talked with him. As the conversation began to flag, the\r Thief yawned terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf. The\r Innkeeper said, “Why do you howl so fearfully?” “I will tell you,” said\r the Thief, “but first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall\r tear them to pieces. I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning,\r nor whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment\r for my crimes, or for any other cause; but this I do know, that when I\r yawn for the third time, I actually turn into a wolf and attack men.”\r With this speech he commenced a second fit of yawning and again howled\r like a wolf, as he had at first. The Innkeeper, hearing his tale and\r believing what he said, became greatly alarmed and, rising from his\r seat, attempted to run away. The Thief laid hold of his coat and\r entreated him to stop, saying, “Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or\r I shall tear them to pieces in my fury, when I turn into a wolf.” At\r the same moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl.\r The Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left his new coat\r in the Thief’s hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn for\r safety. The Thief made off with the coat and did not return again to\r the inn.\r \r Every tale is not to be believed.\r \r \r \r \r The Hart and the Vine\r \r \r A HART, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the large leaves\r of a Vine. The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot the place of his\r concealment. Supposing all danger to have passed, the Hart began to\r nibble the tendrils of the Vine. One of the huntsmen, attracted by the\r rustling of the leaves, looked back, and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow\r from his bow and struck it. The Hart, at the point of death, groaned:\r “I am rightly served, for I should not have maltreated the Vine that\r saved me.”\r \r \r \r \r The Gnat and the Lion\r \r \r A GNAT came and said to a Lion, “I do not in the least fear you, nor\r are you stronger than I am. For in what does your strength consist? You\r can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth an a woman in her\r quarrels. I repeat that I am altogether more powerful than you; and if\r you doubt it, let us fight and see who will conquer.” The Gnat, having\r sounded his horn, fastened himself upon the Lion and stung him on the\r nostrils and the parts of the face devoid of hair. While trying to\r crush him, the Lion tore himself with his claws, until he punished\r himself severely. The Gnat thus prevailed over the Lion, and, buzzing\r about in a song of triumph, flew away. But shortly afterwards he became\r entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider. He\r greatly lamented his fate, saying, “Woe is me! that I, who can wage war\r successfully with the hugest beasts, should perish myself from this\r spider, the most inconsiderable of insects!”\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Grapes\r \r \r A FAMISHED FOX saw some clusters of ripe black grapes hanging from a\r trellised vine. She resorted to all her tricks to get at them, but\r wearied herself in vain, for she could not reach them. At last she\r turned away, hiding her disappointment and saying: “The Grapes are\r sour, and not ripe as I thought.”\r \r \r \r \r The Walnut-Tree\r \r \r A WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop of fruit.\r For the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its branches with stones\r and sticks. The Walnut-Tree piteously exclaimed, “O wretched me! that\r those whom I cheer with my fruit should repay me with these painful\r requitals!”\r \r \r \r \r The Kid and the Wolf\r \r \r A KID, returning without protection from the pasture, was pursued by a\r Wolf. Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and said: “I know,\r friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before I die I would ask of\r you one favour you will play me a tune to which I may dance.” The Wolf\r complied, and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds\r hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the Wolf. Turning to the\r Kid, he said, “It is just what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher,\r should not have turned piper to please you.”\r \r \r \r \r The Monkey and the Dolphin\r \r \r A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him\r while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent\r tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his Monkey, and all\r the crew were obliged to swim for their lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey\r contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is\r always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey\r him on his back in safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with\r his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if\r he were an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was\r descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The Dolphin\r then inquired if he knew the Piræus (the famous harbor of Athens).\r Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him\r very well and that he was an intimate friend. The Dolphin, indignant at\r these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.\r \r \r \r \r The Horse and the Stag\r \r \r AT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself. Then a Stag\r intruded into his domain and shared his pasture. The Horse, desiring to\r revenge himself on the stranger, asked a man if he were willing to help\r him in punishing the Stag. The man replied that if the Horse would\r receive a bit in his mouth and agree to carry him, he would contrive\r effective weapons against the Stag. The Horse consented and allowed the\r man to mount him. From that hour he found that instead of obtaining\r revenge on the Stag, he had enslaved himself to the service of man.\r \r \r \r \r The Jackdaw and the Doves\r \r \r A JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided with food,\r painted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful\r maintenance. The Doves, as long as he was silent, supposed him to be\r one of themselves and admitted him to their cote. But when one day he\r forgot himself and began to chatter, they discovered his true character\r and drove him forth, pecking him with their beaks. Failing to obtain\r food among the Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not\r recognizing him on account of his color, expelled him from living with\r them. So desiring two ends, he obtained neither.\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Monkey\r \r \r A FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road. As they\r journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. “All these\r monuments which you see,” said the Monkey, “are erected in honour of my\r ancestors, who were in their day freedmen and citizens of great\r renown.” The Fox replied, “You have chosen a most appropriate subject\r for your falsehoods, as I am sure none of your ancestors will be able\r to contradict you.”\r \r A false tale often betrays itself.\r \r \r \r \r The Man and His Wife\r \r \r A MAN had a Wife who made herself hated by all the members of his\r household. Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the\r persons in her father’s house, he made some excuse to send her home on\r a visit to her father. After a short time she returned, and when he\r inquired how she had got on and how the servants had treated her, she\r replied, “The herdsmen and shepherds cast on me looks of aversion.” He\r said, “O Wife, if you were disliked by those who go out early in the\r morning with their flocks and return late in the evening, what must\r have been felt towards you by those with whom you passed the whole\r day!”\r \r Straws show how the wind blows.\r \r \r \r \r The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog\r \r \r A HORSE, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought\r shelter and protection from Man. He received them kindly, lighted a\r fire, and warmed them. He let the Horse make free with his oats, gave\r the Ox an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with meat from his own\r table. Grateful for these favours, the animals determined to repay him\r to the best of their ability. For this purpose, they divided the term\r of his life between them, and each endowed one portion of it with the\r qualities which chiefly characterized himself. The Horse chose his\r earliest years and gave them his own attributes: hence every man is in\r his youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own\r opinion. The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life, and\r therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and\r resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. The end of life\r was reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish,\r irritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own\r household, but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to\r his comfort or to his necessities.\r \r \r \r \r The Thief and the Housedog\r \r \r A THIEF came in the night to break into a house. He brought with him\r several slices of meat in order to pacify the Housedog, so that he\r would not alarm his master by barking. As the Thief threw him the\r pieces of meat, the Dog said, “If you think to stop my mouth, you will\r be greatly mistaken. This sudden kindness at your hands will only make\r me more watchful, lest under these unexpected favours to myself, you\r have some private ends to accomplish for your own benefit, and for my\r master’s injury.”\r \r \r \r \r The Apes and the Two Travelers\r \r \r TWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who told nothing\r but lies, were traveling together and by chance came to the land of\r Apes. One of the Apes, who had raised himself to be king, commanded\r them to be seized and brought before him, that he might know what was\r said of him among men. He ordered at the same time that all the Apes be\r arranged in a long row on his right hand and on his left, and that a\r throne be placed for him, as was the custom among men. After these\r preparations he signified that the two men should be brought before\r him, and greeted them with this salutation: “What sort of a king do I\r seem to you to be, O strangers?” The Lying Traveler replied, “You seem\r to me a most mighty king.” “And what is your estimate of those you see\r around me?” “These,” he made answer, “are worthy companions of\r yourself, fit at least to be ambassadors and leaders of armies.” The\r Ape and all his court, gratified with the lie, commanded that a\r handsome present be given to the flatterer. On this the truthful\r Traveler thought to himself, “If so great a reward be given for a lie,\r with what gift may not I be rewarded, if, according to my custom, I\r tell the truth?” The Ape quickly turned to him. “And pray how do I and\r these my friends around me seem to you?” “Thou art,” he said, “a most\r excellent Ape, and all these thy companions after thy example are\r excellent Apes too.” The King of the Apes, enraged at hearing these\r truths, gave him over to the teeth and claws of his companions.\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Lion\r \r \r WHEN A FOX who had never yet seen a Lion, fell in with him by chance\r for the first time in the forest, he was so frightened that he nearly\r died with fear. On meeting him for the second time, he was still much\r alarmed, but not to the same extent as at first. On seeing him the\r third time, he so increased in boldness that he went up to him and\r commenced a familiar conversation with him.\r \r Acquaintance softens prejudices.\r \r \r \r \r The Weasel and the Mice\r \r \r A WEASEL, inactive from age and infirmities, was not able to catch mice\r as he once did. He therefore rolled himself in flour and lay down in a\r dark corner. A Mouse, supposing him to be food, leaped upon him, and\r was instantly caught and squeezed to death. Another perished in a\r similar manner, and then a third, and still others after them. A very\r old Mouse, who had escaped many a trap and snare, observed from a safe\r distance the trick of his crafty foe and said, “Ah! you that lie there,\r may you prosper just in the same proportion as you are what you pretend\r to be!”\r \r \r \r \r The Boy Bathing\r \r \r A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned. He called out\r to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding out a helping\r hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded the boy for his\r imprudence. “Oh, sir!” cried the youth, “pray help me now and scold me\r afterwards.”\r \r Counsel without help is useless.\r \r \r \r \r The Peacock and Juno\r \r \r THE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno that, while the nightingale pleased\r every ear with his song, he himself no sooner opened his mouth than he\r became a laughingstock to all who heard him. The Goddess, to console\r him, said, “But you far excel in beauty and in size. The splendor of\r the emerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with\r painted plumage.” “But for what purpose have I,” said the bird, “this\r dumb beauty so long as I am surpassed in song?” “The lot of each,”\r replied Juno, “has been assigned by the will of the Fates—to thee,\r beauty; to the eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven,\r favourable, and to the crow, unfavourable auguries. These are all\r contented with the endowments allotted to them.”\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Shepherd\r \r \r A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to\r injure one of them. The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against\r him, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over his movements.\r But when the Wolf, day after day, kept in the company of the sheep and\r did not make the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began to\r look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of\r evil against it; and when occasion called him one day into the city, he\r left the sheep entirely in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the\r opportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the\r flock. When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he\r exclaimed: “I have been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a\r Wolf?”\r \r \r \r \r The Hares and the Lions\r \r \r THE HARES harangued the assembly, and argued that all should be equal.\r The Lions made this reply: “Your words, O Hares! are good; but they\r lack both claws and teeth such as we have.”\r \r \r \r \r The Seller of Images\r \r \r A CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image of Mercury and offered it for sale.\r When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to attract purchasers,\r he cried out that he had the statue to sell of a benefactor who\r bestowed wealth and helped to heap up riches. One of the bystanders\r said to him, “My good fellow, why do you sell him, being such a one as\r you describe, when you may yourself enjoy the good things he has to\r give?” “Why,” he replied, “I am in need of immediate help, and he is\r wont to give his good gifts very slowly.”\r \r \r \r \r The Hawk and the Nightingale\r \r \r A NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to his\r wont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of food, swooped down and\r seized him. The Nightingale, about to lose his life, earnestly begged\r the Hawk to let him go, saying that he was not big enough to satisfy\r the hunger of a Hawk who, if he wanted food, ought to pursue the larger\r birds. The Hawk, interrupting him, said: “I should indeed have lost my\r senses if I should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of\r pursuing birds which are not yet even within sight.”\r \r \r \r \r The Lark and Her Young Ones\r \r \r A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat.\r The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use\r of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, when the owner\r of the field, looking over his ripe crop, said, “The time has come when\r I must ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest.” One of the\r young Larks heard his speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of\r her to what place they should move for safety. “There is no occasion to\r move yet, my son,” she replied; “the man who only sends to his friends\r to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest.” The owner of\r the field came again a few days later and saw the wheat shedding the\r grain from excess of ripeness. He said, “I will come myself tomorrow\r with my laborers, and with as many reapers as I can hire, and will get\r in the harvest.” The Lark on hearing these words said to her brood, “It\r is time now to be off, my little ones, for the man is in earnest this\r time; he no longer trusts his friends, but will reap the field\r himself.”\r \r Self-help is the best help.\r \r \r \r \r The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox\r \r \r A DOG and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel together. At\r nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood. The Cock flying up,\r perched himself on the branches of a tree, while the Dog found a bed\r beneath in the hollow trunk. When the morning dawned, the Cock, as\r usual, crowed very loudly several times. A Fox heard the sound, and\r wishing to make a breakfast on him, came and stood under the branches,\r saying how earnestly he desired to make the acquaintance of the owner\r of so magnificent a voice. The Cock, suspecting his civilities, said:\r “Sir, I wish you would do me the favour of going around to the hollow\r trunk below me, and waking my porter, so that he may open the door and\r let you in.” When the Fox approached the tree, the Dog sprang out and\r caught him, and tore him to pieces.\r \r \r \r \r The Geese and the Cranes\r \r \r THE GEESE and the Cranes were feeding in the same meadow, when a\r birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets. The Cranes, being light\r of wing, fled away at his approach; while the Geese, being slower of\r flight and heavier in their bodies, were captured.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and the Wolf\r \r \r AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him, and\r immediately pretended to be lame. The Wolf, coming up, inquired the\r cause of his lameness. The Ass replied that passing through a hedge he\r had trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn. He requested that the Wolf\r pull it out, lest when he ate him it should injure his throat. The Wolf\r consented and lifted up the foot, and was giving his whole mind to the\r discovery of the thorn, when the Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth\r into his mouth and galloped away. The Wolf, being thus fearfully\r mauled, said, “I am rightly served, for why did I attempt the art of\r healing, when my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?”\r \r \r \r \r The Goat and the Ass\r \r \r A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass. The Goat, envying the Ass on account\r of his greater abundance of food, said, “How shamefully you are\r treated: at one time grinding in the mill, and at another carrying\r heavy burdens;” and he further advised him to pretend to be epileptic\r and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest. The Ass listened to his\r words, and falling into a ditch, was very much bruised. His master,\r sending for a leech, asked his advice. He bade him pour upon the wounds\r the lungs of a Goat. They at once killed the Goat, and so healed the\r Ass.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion and the Bull\r \r \r A LION, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to attack\r him on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to ensure his\r destruction. He approached the Bull and said, “I have slain a fine\r sheep, my friend; and if you will come home and partake of him with me,\r I shall be delighted to have your company.” The Lion said this in the\r hope that, as the Bull was in the act of reclining to eat, he might\r attack him to advantage, and make his meal on him. The Bull, on\r approaching the Lion’s den, saw the huge spits and giant caldrons, and\r no sign whatever of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took\r his departure. The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without a\r word of salutation to his host, who had not given him any cause for\r offense. “I have reasons enough,” said the Bull. “I see no indication\r whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, while I do see very\r plainly every preparation for your dining on a bull.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Mask\r \r \r A FOX entered the house of an actor and, rummaging through all his\r properties, came upon a Mask, an admirable imitation of a human head.\r He placed his paws on it and said, “What a beautiful head! Yet it is of\r no value, as it entirely lacks brains.”\r \r \r \r \r The Grasshopper and the Owl\r \r \r AN OWL, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the day, was\r greatly disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and earnestly besought\r her to stop chirping. The Grasshopper refused to desist, and chirped\r louder and louder the more the Owl entreated. When she saw that she\r could get no redress and that her words were despised, the Owl attacked\r the chatterer by a stratagem. “Since I cannot sleep,” she said, “on\r account of your song which, believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo,\r I shall indulge myself in drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave\r me. If you do not dislike it, come to me and we will drink it\r together.” The Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the\r praise of her voice, eagerly flew up. The Owl came forth from her\r hollow, seized her, and put her to death.\r \r \r \r \r The Fowler and the Viper\r \r \r A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch birds.\r Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take it, and fitting\r his twigs to a proper length, watched intently, having his whole\r thoughts directed towards the sky. While thus looking upwards, he\r unknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep just before his feet. The Viper,\r turning about, stung him, and falling into a swoon, the man said to\r himself, “Woe is me! that while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself\r fallen unawares into the snares of death.”\r \r \r \r \r The Horse and the Ass\r \r \r A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway. The\r Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way. “Hardly,” said\r the Horse, “can I resist kicking you with my heels.” The Ass held his\r peace, and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods. Not\r long afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent by his\r owner to the farm. The Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided\r him: “Where, O boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are\r thyself reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt?”\r \r \r \r \r The Lion and the Three Bulls\r \r \r THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together. A Lion lay in ambush in\r the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to attack them while\r they kept together. Having at last by guileful speeches succeeded in\r separating them, he attacked them without fear as they fed alone, and\r feasted on them one by one at his own leisure.\r \r Union is strength.\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Goat\r \r \r A WOLF saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice, where he\r had no chance of reaching her. He called to her and earnestly begged\r her to come lower down, lest she fall by some mishap; and he added that\r the meadows lay where he was standing, and that the herbage was most\r tender. She replied, “No, my friend, it is not for the pasture that you\r invite me, but for yourself, who are in want of food.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fly and the Draught-Mule\r \r \r A FLY sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the\r Draught-Mule said, “How slow you are! Why do you not go faster? See if\r I do not prick your neck with my sting.” The Draught-Mule replied, “I\r do not heed your threats; I only care for him who sits above you, and\r who quickens my pace with his whip, or holds me back with the reins.\r Away, therefore, with your insolence, for I know well when to go fast,\r and when to go slow.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fishermen\r \r \r SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets. Perceiving them to be very\r heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that they had taken a\r large catch. When they had dragged the nets to the shore they found but\r few fish: the nets were full of sand and stones, and the men were\r beyond measure cast down so much at the disappointment which had\r befallen them, but because they had formed such very different\r expectations. One of their company, an old man, said, “Let us cease\r lamenting, my mates, for, as it seems to me, sorrow is always the twin\r sister of joy; and it was only to be looked for that we, who just now\r were over-rejoiced, should next have something to make us sad.”\r \r \r \r \r The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\r \r \r A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him a\r visit and partake of his country fare. As they were on the bare\r plowlands, eating there wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from the\r hedgerow, the Town Mouse said to his friend, “You live here the life of\r the ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded by\r every luxury, and if you will come with me, as I wish you would, you\r shall have an ample share of my dainties.” The Country Mouse was easily\r persuaded, and returned to town with his friend. On his arrival, the\r Town Mouse placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey,\r raisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a\r basket. The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such\r good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his\r own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the\r door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole\r so narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing. They had\r scarcely begun their repast again when someone else entered to take\r something out of a cupboard, whereupon the two Mice, more frightened\r than before, ran away and hid themselves. At last the Country Mouse,\r almost famished, said to his friend: “Although you have prepared for me\r so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. It is\r surrounded by too many dangers to please me. I prefer my bare plowlands\r and roots from the hedgerow, where I can live in safety, and without\r fear.”\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape\r \r \r A WOLF accused a Fox of theft, but the Fox entirely denied the charge.\r An Ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them. When each had\r fully stated his case the Ape announced this sentence: “I do not think\r you, Wolf, ever lost what you claim; and I do believe you, Fox, to have\r stolen what you so stoutly deny.”\r \r The dishonest, if they act honestly, get no credit.\r \r \r \r \r The Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer\r \r \r THE WASPS and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a Farmer\r and besought him to give them some water to drink. They promised amply\r to repay him the favour which they asked. The Partridges declared that\r they would dig around his vines and make them produce finer grapes. The\r Wasps said that they would keep guard and drive off thieves with their\r stings. But the Farmer interrupted them, saying: “I have already two\r oxen, who, without making any promises, do all these things. It is\r surely better for me to give the water to them than to you.”\r \r \r \r \r The Brother and the Sister\r \r \r A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable for his\r good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness. While they were\r playing one day as children, they happened by chance to look together\r into a mirror that was placed on their mother’s chair. The boy\r congratulated himself on his good looks; the girl grew angry, and could\r not bear the self-praises of her Brother, interpreting all he said (and\r how could she do otherwise?) into reflection on herself. She ran off to\r her father, to be avenged on her Brother, and spitefully accused him of\r having, as a boy, made use of that which belonged only to girls. The\r father embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection\r impartially on each, said, “I wish you both would look into the mirror\r every day: you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty by evil\r conduct; and you, my daughter, that you may make up for your lack of\r beauty by your virtues.”\r \r \r \r \r The Dogs and the Fox\r \r \r SOME DOGS, finding the skin of a lion, began to tear it in pieces with\r their teeth. A Fox, seeing them, said, “If this lion were alive, you\r would soon find out that his claws were stronger than your teeth.”\r \r It is easy to kick a man that is down.\r \r \r \r \r The Blind Man and the Whelp\r \r \r A BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by\r touching them with his hands. The whelp of a Wolf was brought him, with\r a request that he would feel it, and say what it was. He felt it, and\r being in doubt, said: “I do not quite know whether it is the cub of a\r Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full well. It would not be\r safe to admit him to the sheepfold.”\r \r Evil tendencies are shown in early life.\r \r \r \r \r The Cobbler Turned Doctor\r \r \r A COBBLER unable to make a living by his trade and made desperate by\r poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not\r known. He sold a drug, pretending that it was an antidote to all\r poisons, and obtained a great name for himself by long-winded puffs and\r advertisements. When the Cobbler happened to fall sick himself of a\r serious illness, the Governor of the town determined to test his skill.\r For this purpose he called for a cup, and while filling it with water,\r pretended to mix poison with the Cobbler’s antidote, commanding him to\r drink it on the promise of a reward. The Cobbler, under the fear of\r death, confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine, and was only\r made famous by the stupid clamors of the crowd. The Governor then\r called a public assembly and addressed the citizens: “Of what folly\r have you been guilty? You have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a\r man, whom no one could employ to make even the shoes for their feet.”\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Horse\r \r \r A WOLF coming out of a field of oats met a Horse and thus addressed\r him: “I would advise you to go into that field. It is full of fine\r oats, which I have left untouched for you, as you are a friend whom I\r would love to hear enjoying good eating.” The Horse replied, “If oats\r had been the food of wolves, you would never have indulged your ears at\r the cost of your belly.”\r \r Men of evil reputation, when they perform a good deed, fail to get\r credit for it.\r \r \r \r \r The Two Men Who Were Enemies\r \r \r TWO MEN, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the same vessel.\r Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one seated himself in\r the stem, and the other in the prow of the ship. A violent storm arose,\r and with the vessel in great danger of sinking, the one in the stern\r inquired of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship would go down\r first. On his replying that he supposed it would be the prow, the Man\r said, “Death would not be grievous to me, if I could only see my Enemy\r die before me.”\r \r \r \r \r The Gamecocks and the Partridge\r \r \r A MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard. One day by chance he found\r a tame Partridge for sale. He purchased it and brought it home to be\r reared with his Gamecocks. When the Partridge was put into the\r poultry-yard, they struck at it and followed it about, so that the\r Partridge became grievously troubled and supposed that he was thus\r evilly treated because he was a stranger. Not long afterwards he saw\r the Cocks fighting together and not separating before one had well\r beaten the other. He then said to himself, “I shall no longer distress\r myself at being struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they\r cannot even refrain from quarreling with each other.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Lion\r \r \r A FOX saw a Lion confined in a cage, and standing near him, bitterly\r reviled him. The Lion said to the Fox, “It is not thou who revilest me;\r but this mischance which has befallen me.”\r \r \r \r \r The Quack Frog\r \r \r A FROG once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh and\r proclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician, skilled\r in the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases. A Fox asked him,\r “How can you pretend to prescribe for others, when you are unable to\r heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin?”\r \r \r \r \r The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox\r \r \r A LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave. All the beasts came to visit\r their king, except the Fox. The Wolf therefore, thinking that he had a\r capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of not paying any\r respect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to\r visit him. At that very moment the Fox came in and heard these last\r words of the Wolf. The Lion roaring out in a rage against him, the Fox\r sought an opportunity to defend himself and said, “And who of all those\r who have come to you have benefited you so much as I, who have traveled\r from place to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt from\r the physicians the means of healing you?” The Lion commanded him\r immediately to tell him the cure, when he replied, “You must flay a\r wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you.” The Wolf was at once\r taken and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile,\r “You should have moved your master not to ill, but to good, will.”\r \r \r \r \r The Dog’s House\r \r \r IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as possible on\r account of the cold, determined to make himself a house. However when\r the summer returned again, he lay asleep stretched at his full length\r and appeared to himself to be of a great size. Now he considered that\r it would be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a\r house as would accommodate him.\r \r \r \r \r The North Wind and the Sun\r \r \r THE NORTH WIND and the Sun disputed as to which was the most powerful,\r and agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip\r a wayfaring man of his clothes. The North Wind first tried his power\r and blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the\r Traveler wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all\r hope of victory, the Wind called upon the Sun to see what he could do.\r The Sun suddenly shone out with all his warmth. The Traveler no sooner\r felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another, and at\r last, fairly overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that\r lay in his path.\r \r Persuasion is better than Force.\r \r \r \r \r The Crow and Mercury\r \r \r A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, making a vow\r to offer some frankincense at his shrine. But when rescued from his\r danger, he forgot his promise. Shortly afterwards, again caught in a\r snare, he passed by Apollo and made the same promise to offer\r frankincense to Mercury. Mercury soon appeared and said to him, “O thou\r most base fellow? how can I believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged\r thy former patron?”\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Crane\r \r \r A FOX invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his\r entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a\r broad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill of the Crane\r at every mouthful, and his vexation at not being able to eat afforded\r the Fox much amusement. The Crane, in his turn, asked the Fox to sup\r with him, and set before her a flagon with a long narrow mouth, so that\r he could easily insert his neck and enjoy its contents at his leisure.\r The Fox, unable even to taste it, met with a fitting requital, after\r the fashion of her own hospitality.\r \r \r \r \r The Wolf and the Lion\r \r \r ROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own shadow\r become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself, “Why\r should I, being of such an immense size and extending nearly an acre in\r length, be afraid of the Lion? Ought I not to be acknowledged as King\r of all the collected beasts?” While he was indulging in these proud\r thoughts, a Lion fell upon him and killed him. He exclaimed with a too\r late repentance, “Wretched me! this overestimation of myself is the\r cause of my destruction.”\r \r \r \r \r The Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat\r \r \r THE BIRDS waged war with the Beasts, and each were by turns the\r conquerors. A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight, always\r fought on the side which he felt was the strongest. When peace was\r proclaimed, his deceitful conduct was apparent to both combatants.\r Therefore being condemned by each for his treachery, he was driven\r forth from the light of day, and henceforth concealed himself in dark\r hiding-places, flying always alone and at night.\r \r \r \r \r The Spendthrift and the Swallow\r \r \r A YOUNG MAN, a great spendthrift, had run through all his patrimony and\r had but one good cloak left. One day he happened to see a Swallow,\r which had appeared before its season, skimming along a pool and\r twittering gaily. He supposed that summer had come, and went and sold\r his cloak. Not many days later, winter set in again with renewed frost\r and cold. When he found the unfortunate Swallow lifeless on the ground,\r he said, “Unhappy bird! what have you done? By thus appearing before\r the springtime you have not only killed yourself, but you have wrought\r my destruction also.”\r \r \r \r \r The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner\r \r \r A TRUMPETER, bravely leading on the soldiers, was captured by the\r enemy. He cried out to his captors, “Pray spare me, and do not take my\r life without cause or without inquiry. I have not slain a single man of\r your troop. I have no arms, and carry nothing but this one brass\r trumpet.” “That is the very reason for which you should be put to\r death,” they said; “for, while you do not fight yourself, your trumpet\r stirs all the others to battle.”\r \r \r \r \r The Owl and the Birds\r \r \r AN OWL, in her wisdom, counseled the Birds that when the acorn first\r began to sprout, to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it\r to grow. She said acorns would produce mistletoe, from which an\r irremediable poison, the bird-lime, would be extracted and by which\r they would be captured. The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed\r of the flax, which men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good\r to them. And, lastly, the Owl, seeing an archer approach, predicted\r that this man, being on foot, would contrive darts armed with feathers\r which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves. The\r Birds gave no credence to these warning words, but considered the Owl\r to be beside herself and said that she was mad. But afterwards, finding\r her words were true, they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to\r be the wisest of birds. Hence it is that when she appears they look to\r her as knowing all things, while she no longer gives them advice, but\r in solitude laments their past folly.\r \r \r \r \r The Goods and the Ills\r \r \r ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share\r which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills by reason\r of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. The Goods wafted\r themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their\r persecutors. They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be\r associated with the Ills, as they had nothing in common and could not\r live together, but were engaged in unceasing warfare; and that an\r indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection.\r Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills\r should visit the earth in company with each other, but that the Goods\r should one by one enter the habitations of men. Hence it arises that\r Ills abound, for they come not one by one, but in troops, and by no\r means singly: while the Goods proceed from Jupiter, and are given, not\r alike to all, but singly, and separately; and one by one to those who\r are able to discern them.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass in the Lion’s Skin\r \r \r AN ASS, having put on the Lion’s skin, roamed about in the forest and\r amused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met in his\r wanderings. At last coming upon a Fox, he tried to frighten him also,\r but the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his voice than he exclaimed,\r “I might possibly have been frightened myself, if I had not heard your\r bray.”\r \r \r \r \r The Sparrow and the Hare\r \r \r A HARE pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and uttered cries like\r a child. A Sparrow upbraided her and said, “Where now is thy remarkable\r swiftness of foot? Why were your feet so slow?” While the Sparrow was\r thus speaking, a hawk suddenly seized him and killed him. The Hare was\r comforted in her death, and expiring said, “Ah! you who so lately, when\r you supposed yourself safe, exulted over my calamity, have now reason\r to deplore a similar misfortune.”\r \r \r \r \r The Flea and the Ox\r \r \r A FLEA thus questioned an Ox: “What ails you, that being so huge and\r strong, you submit to the wrongs you receive from men and slave for\r them day by day, while I, being so small a creature, mercilessly feed\r on their flesh and drink their blood without stint?” The Ox replied: “I\r do not wish to be ungrateful, for I am loved and well cared for by men,\r and they often pat my head and shoulders.” “Woe’s me!” said the flea;\r “this very patting which you like, whenever it happens to me, brings\r with it my inevitable destruction.”\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and His Purchaser\r \r \r A MAN wished to purchase an Ass, and agreed with its owner that he\r should try out the animal before he bought him. He took the Ass home\r and put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses, upon which the new\r animal left all the others and at once joined the one that was most\r idle and the greatest eater of them all. Seeing this, the man put a\r halter on him and led him back to his owner. On being asked how, in so\r short a time, he could have made a trial of him, he answered, “I do not\r need a trial; I know that he will be just the same as the one he chose\r for his companion.”\r \r A man is known by the company he keeps.\r \r \r \r \r The Dove and the Crow\r \r \r A DOVE shut up in a cage was boasting of the large number of young ones\r which she had hatched. A Crow hearing her, said: “My good friend, cease\r from this unseasonable boasting. The larger the number of your family,\r the greater your cause of sorrow, in seeing them shut up in this\r prison-house.”\r \r \r \r \r The Man and the Satyr\r \r \r A MAN and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance\r being formed between them. One very cold wintry day, as they talked,\r the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When the Satyr\r asked the reason for this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands\r because they were so cold. Later on in the day they sat down to eat,\r and the food prepared was quite scalding. The Man raised one of the\r dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it. When the Satyr again\r inquired the reason, he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was\r too hot. “I can no longer consider you as a friend,” said the Satyr, “a\r fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold.”\r \r \r \r \r Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus\r \r \r ACCORDING to an ancient legend, the first man was made by Jupiter, the\r first bull by Neptune, and the first house by Minerva. On the\r completion of their labours, a dispute arose as to which had made the\r most perfect work. They agreed to appoint Momus as judge, and to abide\r by his decision. Momus, however, being very envious of the handicraft\r of each, found fault with all. He first blamed the work of Neptune\r because he had not made the horns of the bull below his eyes, so he\r might better see where to strike. He then condemned the work of\r Jupiter, because he had not placed the heart of man on the outside,\r that everyone might read the thoughts of the evil disposed and take\r precautions against the intended mischief. And, lastly, he inveighed\r against Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in the\r foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove if\r a neighbor proved unpleasant. Jupiter, indignant at such inveterate\r faultfinding, drove him from his office of judge, and expelled him from\r the mansions of Olympus.\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle and the Jackdaw\r \r \r AN EAGLE, flying down from his perch on a lofty rock, seized upon a\r lamb and carried him aloft in his talons. A Jackdaw, who witnessed the\r capture of the lamb, was stirred with envy and determined to emulate\r the strength and flight of the Eagle. He flew around with a great whir\r of his wings and settled upon a large ram, with the intention of\r carrying him off, but his claws became entangled in the ram’s fleece\r and he was not able to release himself, although he fluttered with his\r feathers as much as he could. The shepherd, seeing what had happened,\r ran up and caught him. He at once clipped the Jackdaw’s wings, and\r taking him home at night, gave him to his children. On their saying,\r “Father, what kind of bird is it?” he replied, “To my certain knowledge\r he is a Daw; but he would like you to think an Eagle.”\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle and the Fox\r \r \r AN EAGLE and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to live\r near each other. The Eagle built her nest in the branches of a tall\r tree, while the Fox crept into the underwood and there produced her\r young. Not long after they had agreed upon this plan, the Eagle, being\r in want of provision for her young ones, swooped down while the Fox was\r out, seized upon one of the little cubs, and feasted herself and her\r brood. The Fox on her return, discovered what had happened, but was\r less grieved for the death of her young than for her inability to\r avenge them. A just retribution, however, quickly fell upon the Eagle.\r While hovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing\r a goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it, along\r with a burning cinder, to her nest. A strong breeze soon fanned the\r spark into a flame, and the eaglets, as yet unfledged and helpless,\r were roasted in their nest and dropped down dead at the bottom of the\r tree. There, in the sight of the Eagle, the Fox gobbled them up.\r \r \r \r \r The Two Bags\r \r \r EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world with\r two bags suspended from his neck all bag in front full of his\r neighbors’ faults, and a large bag behind filled with his own faults.\r Hence it is that men are quick to see the faults of others, and yet are\r often blind to their own failings.\r \r \r \r \r The Bitch and Her Whelps\r \r \r A BITCH, ready to whelp, earnestly begged a shepherd for a place where\r she might litter. When her request was granted, she besought permission\r to rear her puppies in the same spot. The shepherd again consented. But\r at last the Bitch, protected by the bodyguard of her Whelps, who had\r now grown up and were able to defend themselves, asserted her exclusive\r right to the place and would not permit the shepherd to approach.\r \r \r \r \r The Stag at the Pool\r \r \r A STAG overpowered by heat came to a spring to drink. Seeing his own\r shadow reflected in the water, he greatly admired the size and variety\r of his horns, but felt angry with himself for having such slender and\r weak feet. While he was thus contemplating himself, a Lion appeared at\r the pool and crouched to spring upon him. The Stag immediately took to\r flight, and exerting his utmost speed, as long as the plain was smooth\r and open kept himself easily at a safe distance from the Lion. But\r entering a wood he became entangled by his horns, and the Lion quickly\r came up to him and caught him. When too late, he thus reproached\r himself: “Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet which would\r have saved me I despised, and I gloried in these antlers which have\r proved my destruction.”\r \r What is most truly valuable is often underrated.\r \r \r \r \r The Lark Burying Her Father\r \r \r THE LARK (according to an ancient legend) was created before the earth\r itself, and when her father died, as there was no earth, she could find\r no place of burial for him. She let him lie uninterred for five days,\r and on the sixth day, not knowing what else to do, she buried him in\r her own head. Hence she obtained her crest, which is popularly said to\r be her father’s grave-hillock.\r \r Youth’s first duty is reverence to parents.\r \r \r \r \r The Gnat and the Bull\r \r \r A GNAT settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time. Just\r as he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and inquired of\r the Bull if he would like him to go. The Bull replied, “I did not know\r you had come, and I shall not miss you when you go away.”\r \r Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of\r their neighbors.\r \r \r \r \r The Monkey and the Camel\r \r \r THE BEASTS of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which the\r Monkey stood up and danced. Having vastly delighted the assembly, he\r sat down amidst universal applause. The Camel, envious of the praises\r bestowed on the Monkey and desiring to divert to himself the favour of\r the guests, proposed to stand up in his turn and dance for their\r amusement. He moved about in so utterly ridiculous a manner that the\r Beasts, in a fit of indignation, set upon him with clubs and drove him\r out of the assembly.\r \r It is absurd to ape our betters.\r \r \r \r \r The Dogs and the Hides\r \r \r SOME DOGS famished with hunger saw a number of cowhides steeping in a\r river. Not being able to reach them, they agreed to drink up the river,\r but it happened that they burst themselves with drinking long before\r they reached the hides.\r \r Attempt not impossibilities.\r \r \r \r \r The Jackdaw and the Fox\r \r \r A HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW seated himself on a fig-tree, which had\r produced some fruit entirely out of season, and waited in the hope that\r the figs would ripen. A Fox seeing him sitting so long and learning the\r reason of his doing so, said to him, “You are indeed, sir, sadly\r deceiving yourself; you are indulging a hope strong enough to cheat\r you, but which will never reward you with enjoyment.”\r \r \r \r \r Mercury and the Workmen\r \r \r A WORKMAN, felling wood by the side of a river, let his axe drop by\r accident into a deep pool. Being thus deprived of the means of his\r livelihood, he sat down on the bank and lamented his hard fate. Mercury\r appeared and demanded the cause of his tears. After he told him his\r misfortune, Mercury plunged into the stream, and, bringing up a golden\r axe, inquired if that were the one he had lost. On his saying that it\r was not his, Mercury disappeared beneath the water a second time,\r returned with a silver axe in his hand, and again asked the Workman if\r it were his. When the Workman said it was not, he dived into the pool\r for the third time and brought up the axe that had been lost. The\r Workman claimed it and expressed his joy at its recovery. Mercury,\r pleased with his honesty, gave him the golden and silver axes in\r addition to his own. The Workman, on his return to his house, related\r to his companions all that had happened. One of them at once resolved\r to try and secure the same good fortune for himself. He ran to the\r river and threw his axe on purpose into the pool at the same place, and\r sat down on the bank to weep. Mercury appeared to him just as he hoped\r he would; and having learned the cause of his grief, plunged into the\r stream and brought up a golden axe, inquiring if he had lost it. The\r Workman seized it greedily, and declared that truly it was the very\r same axe that he had lost. Mercury, displeased at his knavery, not only\r took away the golden axe, but refused to recover for him the axe he had\r thrown into the pool.\r \r \r \r \r The Peasant and the Apple-Tree\r \r \r A PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but only\r served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers. He resolved to\r cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a bold stroke at its\r roots. The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the\r tree that sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him\r and lighten his labours. He paid no attention to their request, but\r gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe. When he reached\r the hollow of the tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted\r the honeycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as\r sacred, took great care of it.\r \r Self-interest alone moves some men.\r \r \r \r \r The Two Soldiers and the Robber\r \r \r TWO SOLDIERS traveling together were set upon by a Robber. The one fled\r away; the other stood his ground and defended himself with his stout\r right hand. The Robber being slain, the timid companion ran up and drew\r his sword, and then, throwing back his traveling cloak said, “I’ll at\r him, and I’ll take care he shall learn whom he has attacked.” On this,\r he who had fought with the Robber made answer, “I only wish that you\r had helped me just now, even if it had been only with those words, for\r I should have been the more encouraged, believing them to be true; but\r now put up your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless\r tongue, till you can deceive others who do not know you. I, indeed, who\r have experienced with what speed you run away, know right well that no\r dependence can be placed on your valor.”\r \r \r \r \r The Shepherd and the Sheep\r \r \r A SHEPHERD driving his Sheep to a wood, saw an oak of unusual size full\r of acorns, and spreading his cloak under the branches, he climbed up\r into the tree and shook them down. The Sheep eating the acorns\r inadvertently frayed and tore the cloak. When the Shepherd came down\r and saw what was done, he said, “O you most ungrateful creatures! You\r provide wool to make garments for all other men, but you destroy the\r clothes of him who feeds you.”\r \r \r \r \r The Trees Under the Protection of the Gods\r \r \r THE GODS, according to an ancient legend, made choice of certain trees\r to be under their special protection. Jupiter chose the oak, Venus the\r myrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele the pine, and Hercules the poplar.\r Minerva, wondering why they had preferred trees not yielding fruit,\r inquired the reason for their choice. Jupiter replied, “It is lest we\r should seem to covet the honour for the fruit.” But said Minerva, “Let\r anyone say what he will the olive is more dear to me on account of its\r fruit.” Then said Jupiter, “My daughter, you are rightly called wise;\r for unless what we do is useful, the glory of it is vain.”\r \r \r \r \r The Flea and the Wrestler\r \r \r A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him, causing\r the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help. When the Flea a second\r time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, “O Hercules! if you\r will not help me against a Flea, how can I hope for your assistance\r against greater antagonists?”\r \r \r \r \r The Lion and the Fox\r \r \r A FOX entered into partnership with a Lion on the pretense of becoming\r his servant. Each undertook his proper duty in accordance with his own\r nature and powers. The Fox discovered and pointed out the prey; the\r Lion sprang on it and seized it. The Fox soon became jealous of the\r Lion carrying off the Lion’s share, and said that he would no longer\r find out the prey, but would capture it on his own account. The next\r day he attempted to snatch a lamb from the fold, but he himself fell\r prey to the huntsmen and hounds.\r \r \r \r \r Truth and the Traveler\r \r \r A WAYFARING MAN, traveling in the desert, met a woman standing alone\r and terribly dejected. He inquired of her, “Who art thou?” “My name is\r Truth,” she replied. “And for what cause,” he asked, “have you left the\r city to dwell alone here in the wilderness?” She made answer, “Because\r in former times, falsehood was with few, but is now with all men.”\r \r \r \r \r The Manslayer\r \r \r A MAN committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of the man\r whom he murdered. On his reaching the river Nile he saw a Lion on its\r bank and being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. He found a serpent\r in the upper branches of the tree, and again being greatly alarmed, he\r threw himself into the river, where a crocodile caught him and ate him.\r Thus the earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to a\r murderer.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion and the Eagle\r \r \r AN EAGLE stayed his flight and entreated a Lion to make an alliance\r with him to their mutual advantage. The Lion replied, “I have no\r objection, but you must excuse me for requiring you to find surety for\r your good faith, for how can I trust anyone as a friend who is able to\r fly away from his bargain whenever he pleases?”\r \r Try before you trust.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and His Driver\r \r \r AN ASS, being driven along a high road, suddenly started off and bolted\r to the brink of a deep precipice. While he was in the act of throwing\r himself over, his owner seized him by the tail, endeavoring to pull him\r back. When the Ass persisted in his effort, the man let him go and\r said, “Conquer, but conquer to your cost.”\r \r \r \r \r The Thrush and the Fowler\r \r \r A THRUSH was feeding on a myrtle-tree and did not move from it because\r its berries were so delicious. A Fowler observed her staying so long in\r one spot, and having well bird-limed his reeds, caught her. The Thrush,\r being at the point of death, exclaimed, “O foolish creature that I am!\r For the sake of a little pleasant food I have deprived myself of my\r life.”\r \r \r \r \r The Mother and the Wolf\r \r \r A FAMISHED WOLF was prowling about in the morning in search of food. As\r he passed the door of a cottage built in the forest, he heard a Mother\r say to her child, “Be quiet, or I will throw you out of the window, and\r the Wolf shall eat you.” The Wolf sat all day waiting at the door. In\r the evening he heard the same woman fondling her child and saying: “You\r are quiet now, and if the Wolf should come, we will kill him.” The\r Wolf, hearing these words, went home, gasping with cold and hunger.\r When he reached his den, Mistress Wolf inquired of him why he returned\r wearied and supperless, so contrary to his wont. He replied: “Why,\r forsooth! use I gave credence to the words of a woman!”\r \r \r \r \r The Hen and the Swallow\r \r \r A HEN finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them warm,\r nourished them into life. A Swallow, observing what she had done, said,\r “You silly creature! why have you hatched these vipers which, when they\r shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?”\r \r \r \r \r The Rose and the Amaranth\r \r \r AN AMARANTH planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus addressed it:\r “What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favourite alike with Gods and with\r men. I envy you your beauty and your perfume.” The Rose replied, “I\r indeed, dear Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season! If no cruel\r hand pluck me from my stem, yet I must perish by an early doom. But\r thou art immortal and dost never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed\r youth.”\r \r \r \r \r The Travelers and the Plane-Tree\r \r \r TWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer’s sun, laid\r themselves down at noon under the widespreading branches of a\r Plane-Tree. As they rested under its shade, one of the Travelers said\r to the other, “What a singularly useless tree is the Plane! It bears no\r fruit, and is not of the least service to man.” The Plane-Tree,\r interrupting him, said, “You ungrateful fellows! Do you, while\r receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade, dare to describe\r me as useless, and unprofitable?”\r \r Some men underrate their best blessings.\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and the Horse\r \r \r AN ASS besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his feed.\r “Yes,” said the Horse; “if any remains out of what I am now eating I\r will give it you for the sake of my own superior dignity, and if you\r will come when I reach my own stall in the evening, I will give you a\r little sack full of barley.” The Ass replied, “Thank you. But I can’t\r think that you, who refuse me a little matter now, will by and by\r confer on me a greater benefit.”\r \r \r \r \r The Crow and the Sheep\r \r \r A TROUBLESOME CROW seated herself on the back of a Sheep. The Sheep,\r much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long\r time, and at last said, “If you had treated a dog in this way, you\r would have had your deserts from his sharp teeth.” To this the Crow\r replied, “I despise the weak and yield to the strong. I know whom I may\r bully and whom I must flatter; and I thus prolong my life to a good old\r age.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Bramble\r \r \r A FOX was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught hold of\r a Bramble to save himself. Having pricked and grievously torn the soles\r of his feet, he accused the Bramble because, when he had fled to her\r for assistance, she had used him worse than the hedge itself. The\r Bramble, interrupting him, said, “But you really must have been out of\r your senses to fasten yourself on me, who am myself always accustomed\r to fasten upon others.”\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and the Charger\r \r \r AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully\r provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even\r that without hard work. But when war broke out, a heavily armed soldier\r mounted the Horse, and riding him to the charge, rushed into the very\r midst of the enemy. The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the\r battlefield. Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind,\r and commiserated the Horse.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant\r \r \r THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints. “It is true, O\r Jupiter!” he said, “that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in shape,\r and powerful in attack. I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet\r furnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest,\r and what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be\r frightened by the crowing of a cock.” Jupiter replied, “Why do you\r blame me without a cause? I have given you all the attributes which I\r possess myself, and your courage never fails you except in this one\r instance.” On hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and,\r reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die. As\r these thoughts passed through his mind, he met an Elephant and came\r close to hold a conversation with him. After a time he observed that\r the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he inquired what was the\r matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor every now and then.\r Just at that moment a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he\r replied, “Do you see that little buzzing insect? If it enters my ear,\r my fate is sealed. I should die presently.” The Lion said, “Well, since\r so huge a beast is afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor\r wish myself dead. I find myself, even as I am, better off than the\r Elephant.”\r \r \r \r \r The Dog and the Oyster\r \r \r A DOG, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his mouth to its\r widest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish, supposing it\r to be an egg. Soon afterwards suffering great pain in his stomach, he\r said, “I deserve all this torment, for my folly in thinking that\r everything round must be an egg.”\r \r They who act without sufficient thought, will often fall into\r unsuspected danger.\r \r \r \r \r The Mules and the Robbers\r \r \r TWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along. One carried\r panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain. The\r Mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of\r the value of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells\r fastened to his neck. His companion followed with quiet and easy step.\r All of a sudden Robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places, and\r in the scuffle with their owners, wounded with a sword the Mule\r carrying the treasure, which they greedily seized while taking no\r notice of the grain. The Mule which had been robbed and wounded\r bewailed his misfortunes. The other replied, “I am indeed glad that I\r was thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with\r any wound.”\r \r \r \r \r The Lamb and the Wolf\r \r \r A WOLF pursued a Lamb, which fled for refuge to a certain Temple. The\r Wolf called out to him and said, “The Priest will slay you in\r sacrifice, if he should catch you.” On which the Lamb replied, “It\r would be better for me to be sacrificed in the Temple than to be eaten\r by you.”\r \r \r \r \r The Partridge and the Fowler\r \r \r A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it. The Partridge\r earnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, “Pray, master, permit\r me to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for\r your mercy to me.” The Fowler replied, “I shall now with less scruple\r take your life, because you are willing to save it at the cost of\r betraying your friends and relations.”\r \r \r \r \r The Flea and the Man\r \r \r A MAN, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and said,\r “Who are you who dare to feed on my limbs, and to cost me so much\r trouble in catching you?” The Flea replied, “O my dear sir, pray spare\r my life, and destroy me not, for I cannot possibly do you much harm.”\r The Man, laughing, replied, “Now you shall certainly die by mine own\r hands, for no evil, whether it be small or large, ought to be\r tolerated.”\r \r \r \r \r The Rich Man and the Tanner\r \r \r A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the\r unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away.\r The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he\r would leave soon. But as he still continued to stay, as time went on,\r the rich man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of\r inconvenience, made no further complaints.\r \r \r \r \r The Viper and the File\r \r \r A VIPER, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools the\r means of satisfying his hunger. He more particularly addressed himself\r to a File, and asked of him the favour of a meal. The File replied,\r “You must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get\r anything from me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to\r give anything in return.”\r \r The covetous are  poor givers.\r \r \r \r \r The Lion and the Shepherd\r \r \r A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn. Soon afterward he\r came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to\r say, “I am a suppliant, and seek your aid.” The Shepherd boldly\r examined the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his\r lap, pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into\r the forest. Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false\r accusation, was condemned “to be cast to the Lions” as the punishment\r for his imputed crime. But when the Lion was released from his cage, he\r recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of\r attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap. The King,\r as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in\r the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his\r friends.\r \r \r \r \r The Camel and Jupiter\r \r \r THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him and\r wished that he himself could obtain the same honours. He went to\r Jupiter, and besought him to give him horns. Jupiter, vexed at his\r request because he was not satisfied with his size and strength of\r body, and desired yet more, not only refused to give him horns, but\r even deprived him of a portion of his ears.\r \r \r \r \r The Panther and the Shepherds\r \r \r A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit. The Shepherds discovered\r him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while\r others, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no\r one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life. At night\r they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on\r the morrow they would find him dead. The Panther, however, when he had\r recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from\r the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps. After a few days he\r came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who\r had attacked him, raged with angry fury. Then they who had spared his\r life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and\r begged only for their lives. To them the Panther made this reply: “I\r remember alike those who sought my life with stones, and those who gave\r me food aside, therefore, your fears. I return as an enemy only to\r those who injured me.”\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle and the Kite\r \r \r AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree in\r company with a Kite. “Why,” said the Kite, “do I see you with such a\r rueful look?” “I seek,” she replied, “a mate suitable for me, and am\r not able to find one.” “Take me,” returned the Kite, “I am much\r stronger than you are.” “Why, are you able to secure the means of\r living by your plunder?” “Well, I have often caught and carried away an\r ostrich in my talons.” The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted\r him as her mate. Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, “Fly off\r and bring me back the ostrich you promised me.” The Kite, soaring aloft\r into the air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from\r the length of time it had lain about the fields. “Is this,” said the\r Eagle, “the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?” The Kite\r replied, “That I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing that I\r would not have promised, however much I knew that I must fail in the\r performance.”\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle and His Captor\r \r \r AN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his wings\r and put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which\r treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief. Later, another\r neighbor purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again. The\r Eagle took flight, and pouncing upon a hare, brought it at once as an\r offering to his benefactor. A Fox, seeing this, exclaimed, “Do not\r cultivate the favour of this man, but of your former owner, lest he\r should again hunt for you and deprive you a second time of your wings.”\r \r \r \r \r The King’s Son and the Painted Lion\r \r \r A KING, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in\r which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion. Afraid the\r dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and\r adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized\r animals, among which was the picture of a lion. When the young Prince\r saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and,\r standing near the lion, he said: “O you most detestable of animals!\r through a lying dream of my father’s, which he saw in his sleep, I am\r shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl: what\r shall I now do to you?” With these words he stretched out his hands\r toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that\r he might beat the lion. But one of the tree’s prickles pierced his\r finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince\r fell down in a fainting fit. A violent fever suddenly set in, from\r which he died not many days later.\r \r We had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them.\r \r \r \r \r The Cat and Venus\r \r \r A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus to\r change her into the form of a woman. Venus consented to her request and\r transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the youth saw her and\r loved her, and took her home as his bride. While the two were reclining\r in their chamber, Venus wishing to discover if the Cat in her change of\r shape had also altered her habits of life, let down a mouse in the\r middle of the room. The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition,\r started up from the couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it.\r Venus was much disappointed and again caused her to return to her\r former shape.\r \r Nature exceeds nurture.\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle and the Beetle\r \r \r THE EAGLE and the Beetle were at enmity together, and they destroyed\r one another’s nests. The Eagle gave the first provocation in seizing\r upon and in eating the young ones of the Beetle. The Beetle got by\r stealth at the Eagle’s eggs, and rolled them out of the nest, and\r followed the Eagle even into the presence of Jupiter. On the Eagle\r making his complaint, Jupiter ordered him to make his nest in his lap;\r and while Jupiter had the eggs in his lap, the Beetle came flying about\r him, and Jupiter rising up unawares, to drive him away from his head,\r threw down the eggs, and broke them.\r \r The weak often revenge themselves on those who use them ill, even\r though they be more powerful.\r \r \r \r \r The She-Goats and Their Beards\r \r \r THE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, the\r He-Goats were sorely displeased and made complaint that the females\r equaled them in dignity. “Allow them,” said Jupiter, “to enjoy an empty\r honour and to assume the badge of your nobler sex, so long as they are\r not your equals in strength or courage.”\r \r It matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should be\r like us in outside appearances.\r \r \r \r \r The Bald Man and the Fly\r \r \r A FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy it,\r gave himself a heavy slap. Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, “You who\r have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect,\r see what you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?” The Bald\r Man replied, “I can easily make peace with myself, because I know there\r was no intention to hurt. But you, an ill-favoured and contemptible\r insect who delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have\r killed you even if I had incurred a heavier penalty.”\r \r \r \r \r The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea\r \r \r A SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept after\r his buffetings with the deep. After a while he awoke, and looking upon\r the Sea, loaded it with reproaches. He argued that it enticed men with\r the calmness of its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its\r waters, it grew rough and destroyed them. The Sea, assuming the form of\r a woman, replied to him: “Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for\r I am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the\r winds suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into\r fury.”\r \r \r \r \r The Buffoon and the Countryman\r \r \r A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to the people,\r and gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who\r invented a new amusement for the occasion. Various public performers\r contended for the prize. Among them came a Buffoon well known among the\r populace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment\r which had never been brought out on any stage before. This report being\r spread about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every\r part. The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any\r apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused an\r intense silence. He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and\r imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice that\r the audience declared he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded\r that it should be shaken out. When that was done and nothing was found,\r they cheered the actor, and loaded him with the loudest applause. A\r Countryman in the crowd, observing all that has passed, said, “So help\r me, Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!” and at once\r proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day, though in a\r much more natural way. On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in\r the theater, but now partiality for their favourite actor very\r generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the\r Countryman than to see the spectacle. Both of the performers appeared\r on the stage. The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and\r obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the\r spectators. Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he\r concealed a little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but\r not suspected by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull\r his ear causing the pig to squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out with\r one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and\r clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater. On this\r the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the\r most positive proof the greatness of their mistake. “Look here,” he\r said, “this shows what sort of judges you are.”\r \r \r \r \r The Crow and the Serpent\r \r \r A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny nook, and\r flying down, greedily seized him. The Serpent, turning about, bit the\r Crow with a mortal wound. In the agony of death, the bird exclaimed: “O\r unhappy me! who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the\r source of my destruction.”\r \r \r \r \r The Hunter and the Horseman\r \r \r A CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his shoulders\r and set out homewards. On his way he met a man on horseback who begged\r the hare of him, under the pretense of purchasing it. However, when the\r Horseman got the hare, he rode off as fast as he could. The Hunter ran\r after him, as if he was sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman\r increased more and more the distance between them. The Hunter, sorely\r against his will, called out to him and said, “Get along with you! for\r I will now make you a present of the hare.”\r \r \r \r \r The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree\r \r \r THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all\r the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons. A\r shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage,\r it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at\r once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree. But finding the\r Fig-Tree denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and\r did not injure it at all.\r \r \r \r \r The Frogs’ Complaint Against the Sun\r \r \r ONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun announced his intention to take a wife,\r the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. Jupiter,\r disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the cause of their\r complaint. One of them said, “The Sun, now while he is single, parches\r up the marsh, and compels us to die miserably in our arid homes. What\r will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?”\r \r \r \r \r The Brazier and His Dog\r \r \r A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favourite with his\r master, and his constant companion. While he hammered away at his\r metals the Dog slept; but when, on the other hand, he went to dinner\r and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as if he would\r ask for a share of his meal. His master one day, pretending to be angry\r and shaking his stick at him, said, “You wretched little sluggard! what\r shall I do to you? While I am hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the\r mat; and when I begin to eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your\r tail for food. Do you not know that labor is the source of every\r blessing, and that none but those who work are entitled to eat?”\r \r \r \r \r FOOTNOTES\r \r \r 1 (return)\r [ A History of the Literature of Ancient Greece, by K.

On the first occasion of their being\r composed they were intended to refer to some passing event, or to some\r individual acts of wrong-doing. Thus, the fables of the “Eagle and the\r Fox” and of the “Fox and Monkey” are supposed to have been written by\r Archilochus, to avenge the injuries done him by Lycambes. So also the\r fables of the “Swollen Fox” and of the “Frogs asking a King” were\r spoken by Æsop for the immediate purpose of reconciling the inhabitants\r of Samos and Athens to their respective rulers, Periander and\r Pisistratus; while the fable of the “Horse and Stag” was composed to\r caution the inhabitants of Himera against granting a bodyguard to\r Phalaris. In a similar manner, the fable from Phædrus, the “Marriage of\r the Sun,” is supposed to have reference to the contemplated union of\r Livia, the daughter of Drusus, with Sejanus the favourite, and minister\r of Trajan. These fables, however, though thus originating in special\r events, and designed at first to meet special circumstances, are so\r admirably constructed as to be fraught with lessons of general utility,\r and of universal application.]\r \r \r 4 (return)\r [ Hesiod.

There are two celebrated works which might by some be classed\r amongst works of this description. The one is the “Speculum Sapientiæ,”\r attributed to St. Cyril, Archbishop of Jerusalem, but of a considerably\r later origin, and existing only in Latin. It is divided into four\r books, and consists of long conversations conducted by fictitious\r characters under the figures the beasts of the field and forest, and\r aimed at the rebuke of particular classes of men, the boastful, the\r proud, the luxurious, the wrathful, &c. None of the stories are\r precisely those of Æsop, and none have the concinnity, terseness, and\r unmistakable deduction of the lesson intended to be taught by the\r fable, so conspicuous in the great Greek fabulist. The exact title of\r the book is this: “Speculum Sapientiæ, B. Cyrilli Episcopi: alias\r quadripartitus apologeticus vocatus, in cujus quidem proverbiis omnis\r et totius sapientiæ speculum claret et feliciter incipit.” The other is\r a larger work in two volumes, published in the fourteenth century by\r Cæsar Heisterbach, a Cistercian monk, under the title of “Dialogus\r Miraculorum,” reprinted in 1851. This work consists of conversations in\r which many stories are interwoven on all kinds of subjects. It has no\r correspondence with the pure Æsopian fable.]\r \r \r 12 (return)\r [ Post-mediæval Preachers, by S. Baring-Gould.

narrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a hidden meaning,\r and that not so much by the use of language, as by the skilful\r introduction of fictitious characters; and yet, unlike to either Tale\r or Parable, it will ever keep in view, as its high prerogative, and\r inseparable attribute, the great purpose of instruction, and will\r necessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim, social duty, or\r political truth.", "The true Fable, if it rise to its high requirements,\r ever aims at one great end and purpose—the representation of human\r motive, and the improvement of human conduct, and yet it so conceals\r its design under the disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing\r with speech the animals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees\r of the wood, or the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive\r advice without perceiving the presence of the adviser.", "Thus the\r superiority of the counsellor, which often renders counsel unpalatable,\r is kept out of view, and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance\r when the reader is led, unconsciously to himself, to have his\r sympathies enlisted in behalf of what is pure, honourable, and\r praiseworthy, and to have his indignation excited against what is low,\r ignoble, and unworthy.", "The true fabulist, therefore, discharges a most\r important function.", "He is neither a narrator, nor an allegorist.", "He is\r a great teacher, a corrector of morals, a censor of vice, and a\r commender of virtue.", "In this consists the superiority of the Fable over\r the Tale or the Parable.", "The fabulist is to create a laugh, but yet,\r under a merry guise, to convey instruction.", "Phædrus, the great imitator\r of Æsop, plainly indicates this double purpose to be the true office of\r the writer of fables.", "Duplex libelli dos est: quod risum movet,\r     Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet.", "The continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm, and\r accounts for the universal favour, of the fables of Æsop.", "“The fable,”\r says Professor K.", "O.", "Mueller, “originated in Greece in an intentional\r travestie of human affairs.", "The ‘ainos,’ as its name denotes, is an\r admonition, or rather a reproof, veiled, either from fear of an excess\r of frankness, or from a love of fun and jest, beneath the fiction of an\r occurrence happening among beasts; and wherever we have any ancient and\r authentic account of the Æsopian fables, we find it to be the same.”[1]\r \r The construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1), the\r narration itself; (2), the deduction of the moral; and (3), a careful\r maintenance of the individual characteristics of the fictitious\r personages introduced into it.", "The narration should relate to one\r simple action, consistent with itself, and neither be overladen with a\r multiplicity of details, nor distracted by a variety of circumstances.", "The moral or lesson should be so plain, and so intimately interwoven\r with, and so necessarily dependent on, the narration, that every reader\r should be compelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation.", "The introduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be\r marked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their natural\r attributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by universal\r popular consent.", "The Fox should be always cunning, the Hare timid, the\r Lion bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the Horse proud, and the\r Ass patient.", "Many of these fables are characterized by the strictest\r observance of these rules.", "They are occupied with one short narrative,\r from which the moral naturally flows, and with which it is intimately\r associated.", "“’Tis the simple manner,” says Dodsley,[2] “in which the\r morals of Æsop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him,\r and gives him the preference over all other mythologists.", "His ‘Mountain\r delivered of a Mouse,’ produces the moral of his fable in ridicule of\r pompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops her cheese, lets fall,\r as it were by accident, the strongest admonition against the power of\r flattery.", "There is no need of a separate sentence to explain it; no\r possibility of impressing it deeper, by that load we too often see of\r accumulated reflections.”[3] An equal amount of praise is due for the\r consistency with which the characters of the animals, fictitiously\r introduced, are marked.", "While they are made to depict the motives and\r passions of men, they retain, in an eminent degree, their own special\r features of craft or counsel, of cowardice or courage, of generosity or\r rapacity.", "These terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed on all\r the fables in this collection.", "Many of them lack that unity of design,\r that close connection of the moral with the narrative, that wise choice\r in the introduction of the animals, which constitute the charm and\r excellency of true Æsopian fable.", "This inferiority of some to others is\r sufficiently accounted for in the history of the origin and descent of\r these fables.", "The great bulk of them are not the immediate work of\r Æsop.", "Many are obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which\r he lived.", "Thus, the fable of the “Hawk and the Nightingale” is related\r by Hesiod;[4] the “Eagle wounded by an Arrow, winged with its own\r feathers,” by Æschylus;[5] the “Fox avenging his wrongs on the Eagle,”\r by Archilochus.[6] Many of them again are of later origin, and are to\r be traced to the monks of the middle ages: and yet this collection,\r though thus made up of fables both earlier and later than the era of\r Æsop, rightfully bears his name, because he composed so large a number\r (all framed in the same mould, and conformed to the same fashion, and\r stamped with the same lineaments, image, and superscription) as to\r secure to himself the right to be considered the father of Greek\r fables, and the founder of this class of writing, which has ever since\r borne his name, and has secured for him, through all succeeding ages,\r the position of the first of moralists.[7]\r \r The fables were in the first instance only narrated by Æsop, and for a\r long time were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral tradition.", "Socrates is mentioned by Plato[8] as having employed his time while in\r prison, awaiting the return of the sacred ship from Delphos which was\r to be the signal of his death, in turning some of these fables into\r verse, but he thus versified only such as he remembered.", "Demetrius\r Phalereus, a philosopher at Athens about 300 B.C., is said to have made\r the first collection of these fables.", "Phædrus, a slave by birth or by\r subsequent misfortunes, and admitted by Augustus to the honours of a\r freedman, imitated many of these fables in Latin iambics about the\r commencement of the Christian era.", "Aphthonius, a rhetorician of\r Antioch, A.D.", "315, wrote a treatise on, and converted into Latin prose,\r some of these fables.", "This translation is the more worthy of notice, as\r it illustrates a custom of common use, both in these and in later\r times.", "The rhetoricians and philosophers were accustomed to give the\r Fables of Æsop as an exercise to their scholars, not only inviting them\r to discuss the moral of the tale, but also to practice and to perfect\r themselves thereby in style and rules of grammar, by making for\r themselves new and various versions of the fables.", "Ausonius,[9] the\r friend of the Emperor Valentinian, and the latest poet of eminence in\r the Western Empire, has handed down some of these fables in verse,\r which Julianus Titianus, a contemporary writer of no great name,\r translated into prose.", "Avienus, also a contemporary of Ausonius, put\r some of these fables into Latin elegiacs, which are given by Nevelet\r (in a book we shall refer to hereafter), and are occasionally\r incorporated with the editions of Phædrus.", "Seven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the Fables\r of Æsop.", "During this long period these fables seem to have suffered an\r eclipse, to have disappeared and to have been forgotten; and it is at\r the commencement of the fourteenth century, when the Byzantine emperors\r were the great patrons of learning, and amidst the splendors of an\r Asiatic court, that we next find honours paid to the name and memory of\r Æsop.", "Maximus Planudes, a learned monk of Constantinople, made a\r collection of about a hundred and fifty of these fables.", "Little is\r known of his history.", "Planudes, however, was no mere recluse, shut up\r in his monastery.", "He took an active part in public affairs.", "In 1327\r A.D.", "he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Venice by the Emperor\r Andronicus the Elder.", "This brought him into immediate contact with the\r Western Patriarch, whose interests he henceforth advocated with so much\r zeal as to bring on him suspicion and persecution from the rulers of\r the Eastern Church.", "Planudes has been exposed to a two-fold accusation.", "He is charged on the one hand with having had before him a copy of\r Babrias (to whom we shall have occasion to refer at greater length in\r the end of this Preface), and to have had the bad taste “to transpose,”\r or to turn his poetical version into prose: and he is asserted, on the\r other hand, never to have seen the Fables of Æsop at all, but to have\r himself invented and made the fables which he palmed off under the name\r of the famous Greek fabulist.", "The truth lies between these two\r extremes.", "Planudes may have invented some few fables, or have inserted\r some that were current in his day; but there is an abundance of\r unanswerable internal evidence to prove that he had an acquaintance\r with the veritable fables of Æsop, although the versions he had access\r to were probably corrupt, as contained in the various translations and\r disquisitional exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers.", "His\r collection is interesting and important, not only as the parent source\r or foundation of the earlier printed versions of Æsop, but as the\r direct channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the\r learned.", "The eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Æsop to their\r high place in the general literature of Christendom, is to be looked\r for in the West rather than in the East.", "The calamities gradually\r thickening round the Eastern Empire, and the fall of Constantinople,\r 1453 A.D.", "combined with other events to promote the rapid restoration\r of learning in Italy; and with that recovery of learning the revival of\r an interest in the Fables of Æsop is closely identified.", "These fables,\r indeed, were among the first writings of an earlier antiquity that\r attracted attention.", "They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures\r and the ancient classic authors, in the minds of the great students of\r that day.", "Lorenzo Valla, one of the most famous promoters of Italian\r learning, not only translated into Latin the Iliad of Homer and the\r Histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, but also the Fables of Æsop.", "These fables, again, were among the books brought into an extended\r circulation by the agency of the printing press.", "Bonus Accursius, as\r early as 1475–1480, printed the collection of these fables, made by\r Planudes, which, within five years afterwards, Caxton translated into\r English, and printed at his press in Westminster Abbey, 1485.[10] It\r must be mentioned also that the learning of this age has left permanent\r traces of its influence on these fables,[11] by causing the\r interpolation with them (as a κτῆμα εἰς ἰει) of some of those amusing\r stories which were so frequently introduced into the public discourses\r of the great preachers of those days, and of which specimens are yet to\r be found in the extant sermons of Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel\r Barlette.[12] The publication of this era which most probably has\r influenced these fables, is the “Liber Facetiarum,”[13] a book\r consisting of a hundred jests and stories, by the celebrated Poggio\r Bracciolini, published A.D.", "1471, from which the two fables of the\r “Miller, his Son, and the Ass,” and the “Fox and the Woodcutter,” are\r undoubtedly selected.", "The knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into Germany,\r and their popularity was increased by the favour and sanction given to\r them by the great fathers of the Reformation, who frequently used them\r as vehicles for satire and protest against the tricks and abuses of the\r Romish ecclesiastics.", "The zealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an\r active part in the preparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found\r time, amidst his numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the\r students in the University of Tübingen, in which he was a professor.", "Martin Luther translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by\r Melancthon to complete the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the\r celebrated Lutheran theologian, and librarian to Frederick I., king of\r Prussia, mentions that the great Reformer valued the Fables of Æsop\r next after the Holy Scriptures.", "In 1546 A.D.", "the second printed edition\r of the collection of the Fables made by Planudes, was issued from the\r printing-press of Robert Stephens, in which were inserted some\r additional fables from a MS.", "in the Bibliothêque du Roy at Paris.", "The greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the Fables\r of Æsop to a place in the literature of the world, was made in the\r early part of the seventeenth century.", "In the year 1610, a learned\r Swiss, Isaac Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the third printed edition of\r these fables, in a work entitled “Mythologia Æsopica.” This was a noble\r effort to do honour to the great fabulist, and was the most perfect\r collection of Æsopian fables ever yet published.", "It consisted, in\r addition to the collection of fables given by Planudes and reprinted in\r the various earlier editions, of one hundred and thirty-six new fables\r (never before published) from MSS.", "in the Library of the Vatican, of\r forty fables attributed to Aphthonius, and of forty-three from Babrias.", "It also contained the Latin versions of the same fables by Phædrus,\r Avienus, and other authors.", "This volume of Nevelet forms a complete\r “Corpus Fabularum Æsopicarum;” and to his labours Æsop owes his\r restoration to universal favour as one of the wise moralists and great\r teachers of mankind.", "During the interval of three centuries which has\r elapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet’s, no book,\r with the exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider circulation\r than Æsop’s Fables.", "They have been translated into the greater number\r of the languages both of Europe and of the East, and have been read,\r and will be read, for generations, alike by Jew, Heathen, Mohammedan,\r and Christian.", "They are, at the present time, not only engrafted into\r the literature of the civilized world, but are familiar as household\r words in the common intercourse and daily conversation of the\r inhabitants of all countries.", "This collection of Nevelet’s is the great culminating point in the\r history of the revival of the fame and reputation of Æsopian Fables.", "It\r is remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the germ of an idea,\r which has been since proved to have been correct by a strange chain of\r circumstances.", "Nevelet intimates an opinion, that a writer named\r Babrias would be found to be the veritable author of the existing form\r of Æsopian Fables.", "This intimation has since given rise to a series of\r inquiries, the knowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to\r a full understanding of the true position of Æsop in connection with\r the writings that bear his name.", "The history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it might not\r unfitly be enumerated among the curiosities of literature.", "He is\r generally supposed to have been a Greek of Asia Minor, of one of the\r Ionic Colonies, but the exact period in which he lived and wrote is yet\r unsettled.", "He is placed, by one critic,[14] as far back as the\r institution of the Achaian League, B.C.", "250; by another as late as the\r Emperor Severus, who died A.D.", "235; while others make him a\r contemporary with Phædrus in the time of Augustus.", "At whatever time he\r wrote his version of Æsop, by some strange accident it seems to have\r entirely disappeared, and to have been lost sight of.", "His name is\r mentioned by Avienus; by Suidas, a celebrated critic, at the close of\r the eleventh century, who gives in his lexicon several isolated verses\r of his version of the fables; and by John Tzetzes, a grammarian and\r poet of Constantinople, who lived during the latter half of the twelfth\r century.", "Nevelet, in the preface to the volume which we have described,\r points out that the Fables of Planudes could not be the work of Æsop,\r as they contain a reference in two places to “Holy monks,” and give a\r verse from the Epistle of St.", "James as an “Epimith” to one of the\r fables, and suggests Babrias as their author.", "Francis Vavassor,[15] a\r learned French jesuit, entered at greater length on this subject, and\r produced further proofs from internal evidence, from the use of the\r word Piræus in describing the harbour of Athens, a name which was not\r given till two hundred years after Æsop, and from the introduction of\r other modern words, that many of these fables must have been at least\r committed to writing posterior to the time of Æsop, and more boldly\r suggests Babrias as their author or collector.[16] These various\r references to Babrias induced Dr.", "Richard Bentley, at the close of the\r seventeenth century, to examine more minutely the existing versions of\r Æsop’s Fables, and he maintained that many of them could, with a slight\r change of words, be resolved into the Scazonic[17] iambics, in which\r Babrias is known to have written: and, with a greater freedom than the\r evidence then justified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claim to\r the exclusive authorship of these fables.", "Such a seemingly extravagant\r theory, thus roundly asserted, excited much opposition.", "Dr.", "Bentley[18]\r met with an able antagonist in a member of the University of Oxford,\r the Hon.", "Mr.", "Charles Boyle,[19] afterwards Earl of Orrery.", "Their\r letters and disputations on this subject, enlivened on both sides with\r much wit and learning, will ever bear a conspicuous place in the\r literary history of the seventeenth century.", "The arguments of Dr.", "Bentley were yet further defended a few years later by Mr.", "Thomas\r Tyrwhitt, a well-read scholar, who gave up high civil distinctions that\r he might devote himself the more unreservedly to literary pursuits.", "Mr.", "Tyrwhitt published, A.D.", "1776, a Dissertation on Babrias, and a\r collection of his fables in choliambic metre found in a MS.", "in the\r Bodleian Library at Oxford.", "Francesco de Furia, a learned Italian,\r contributed further testimony to the correctness of the supposition\r that Babrias had made a veritable collection of fables by printing from\r a MS.", "contained in the Vatican library several fables never before\r published.", "In the year 1844, however, new and unexpected light was\r thrown upon this subject.", "A veritable copy of Babrias was found in a\r manner as singular as were the MSS.", "of Quinctilian’s Institutes, and of\r Cicero’s Orations by Poggio in the monastery of St.", "Gall A.D.", "1416.", "M.", "Menoides, at the suggestion of M.", "Villemain, Minister of Public\r Instruction to King Louis Philippe, had been entrusted with a\r commission to search for ancient MSS., and in carrying out his\r instructions he found a MS.", "at the convent of St.", "Laura, on Mount\r Athos, which proved to be a copy of the long suspected and wished-for\r choliambic version of Babrias.", "This MS.", "was found to be divided into\r two books, the one containing a hundred and twenty-five, and the other\r ninety-five fables.", "This discovery attracted very general attention,\r not only as confirming, in a singular manner, the conjectures so boldly\r made by a long chain of critics, but as bringing to light valuable\r literary treasures tending to establish the reputation, and to confirm\r the antiquity and authenticity of the great mass of Æsopian Fable.", "The\r Fables thus recovered were soon published.", "They found a most worthy\r editor in the late distinguished Sir George Cornewall Lewis, and a\r translator equally qualified for his task, in the Reverend James\r Davies, M.A., sometime a scholar of Lincoln College, Oxford, and\r himself a relation of their English editor.", "Thus, after an eclipse of\r many centuries, Babrias shines out as the earliest, and most reliable\r collector of veritable Æsopian Fables.", "Having thus given a complete synopsis of the origin, descent, and\r history of these fables, it only remains to explain the reasons which\r have induced the Publishers to prepare a new edition of Æsop, and to\r state the grounds on which they hope to establish a claim for support\r and public approval in their undertaking.", "They boldly assert that the\r new light thrown upon these fables by the discovery of the metrical\r version by Babrias, renders a new translation an inevitable necessity.", "The two chief existing English versions of Æsop are those by Archdeacon\r Croxall, and by the late Rev.", "Thomas James, canon of Peterborough.", "The\r first of these deviates so very far from the text, that it degenerates\r into a parody.", "The fables are so padded, diluted, and altered, as to\r give very little idea to the reader either of the terseness or the\r meaning of the original.", "The second of these is an improvement on its\r predecessor, but Mr.", "James, either out of compliance with the wishes of\r the publishers, or in condescension to the taste prevalent some twenty\r years ago, has so freely introduced as the point of the fable\r conventional English sayings which are not sanctioned by the Greek, and\r which in many instances are scarcely equivalent to it, that his version\r frequently approaches a paraphrase rather than a translation.", "The Publishers therefore ground their first claim for public approval\r on the necessity of a new translation.", "They trust further that their\r present work will have met that necessity in a satisfactory manner.", "They have sought to give as nearly a literal translation as possible of\r the Greek text; and they hope that if the reader should miss the\r smoothness and thoroughly English tone which characterized the previous\r version of these fables, he will be more than repaid by gaining a\r nearer approach to the spirit, thoughts, and (in some cases) to the\r epigrammatic terseness of the original.", "The Publishers trust to\r vindicate, on another ground, their claims to a share of public\r patronage.", "They have inserted a hundred new fables, and they have the\r satisfaction of knowing that this edition, on which they have spared no\r pains nor cost, will afford a larger choice, and greater variety, to\r the numerous and increasing circle of the admirers of Æsopian Fables.", "Whatever be the result of their labours, they will be content to have\r contributed towards promoting a wider acquaintance with fables, the\r wisdom, excellency, and wonderful suitableness of which to every\r condition of humanity has been attested and confirmed by the experience\r of so many generations; and which in all ages, amidst the ever changing\r fluctuations of human opinion, are adapted alike to amuse the young,\r and to instruct the thoughtful, and are well fitted to teach all who\r study them lessons useful for their guidance in every position of\r political, social, civil, or domestic life.", "The Editor must claim the privilege of adding a few words on a matter\r personal to himself.", "He has already within the last few months been\r connected with one edition of Æsop, and it may seem strange that he\r should be willing to undertake the superintendence of another.", "His\r answer is, that the two works on which he has been engaged were totally\r distinct, and entirely independent of each other.", "The first was a\r request to furnish new morals and applications to a definite number of\r fables; Ihe other was a commission to add a large number of additional\r fables and to make a wholly new translation.", "The necessity of a new and\r improved translation the Editor then recognized, and would have\r willingly undertaken.", "It was a wish he had much at heart, and when the\r proposal was voluntarily made to him by the present Publishers, to\r undertake the task of a new translation of an enlarged number of Æsop’s\r Fables, he saw no reason for refusing the offer because of his prior\r discharge of a totally different design; and he resolved to comply with\r the request submitted to him, and to do his best towards the attainment\r of so desirable an object as a purer translation and more literal\r rendering of fables so justly celebrated.", "The following are the sources from which the present translation has\r been prepared:—\r \r Babrii Fabulæ Æsopeæ.", "George Cornewall Lewis.", "Oxford, 1846.", "Babrii Fabulæ Æsopeæ.",

of being the birthplace of Æsop.", "Although the honour thus\r claimed cannot be definitely assigned to any one of these places, yet\r there are a few incidents now generally accepted by scholars as\r established facts, relating to the birth, life, and death of Æsop.", "He\r is, by an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about the\r year 620 B.C., and to have been by birth a slave.", "He was owned by two\r masters in succession, both inhabitants of Samos, Xanthus and Jadmon,\r the latter of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for his learning\r and wit.", "One of the privileges of a freedman in the ancient republics\r of Greece, was the permission to take an active interest in public\r affairs; and Æsop, like the philosophers Phædo, Menippus, and\r Epictetus, in later times, raised himself from the indignity of a\r servile condition to a position of high renown.", "In his desire alike to\r instruct and to be instructed, he travelled through many countries, and\r among others came to Sardis, the capital of the famous king of Lydia,\r the great patron, in that day, of learning and of learned men.", "He met\r at the court of Crœsus with Solon, Thales, and other sages, and is\r related so to have pleased his royal master by the part he took in the\r conversations held with these philosophers, that he applied to him an\r expression which has since passed into a proverb, “μᾶλλον ὁ Φρύξ.” “The\r Phrygian has spoken better than all.”\r \r On the invitation of Crœsus he fixed his residence at Sardis, and was\r employed by that monarch in various difficult and delicate affairs of\r State.", "In his discharge of these commissions he visited the different\r petty republics of Greece.", "At one time he is found in Corinth, and at\r another in Athens, endeavouring, by the narration of some of his wise\r fables, to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities to the\r administration of their respective rulers Periander and Pisistratus.", "One of these ambassadorial missions, undertaken at the command of\r Crœsus, was the occasion of his death.", "Having been sent to Delphi with\r a large sum of gold for distribution among the citizens, he was so\r provoked at their covetousness that he refused to divide the money, and\r sent it back to his master.", "The Delphians, enraged at this treatment,\r accused him of impiety, and, in spite of his sacred character as\r ambassador, executed him as a public criminal.", "This cruel death of Æsop\r was not unavenged.", "The citizens of Delphi were visited with a series of\r calamities, until they made a public reparation of their crime; and,\r “The blood of Æsop” became a well-known adage, bearing witness to the\r truth that deeds of wrong would not pass unpunished.", "Neither did the\r great

"This life by Planudes contains, however, so\r small an amount of truth, and is so full of absurd pictures of the\r grotesque deformity of Æsop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying\r legends, and gross anachronisms, that it is now universally condemned\r as false, puerile, and unauthentic.[20] It is given up in the present\r day, by general consent, as unworthy of the slightest credit.",

feed in my\r pasture.” “No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have not yet tasted\r grass.” Again said the Wolf, “You drink of my well.” “No,” exclaimed\r the Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is both\r food and drink to me.” Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up,\r saying, “Well!", "I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every\r one of my imputations.” The tyrant will always find a pretext for his\r tyranny.", "The Ass And The Grasshopper\r \r \r AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted;\r and, desiring to possess the

and the Shadow\r \r \r A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his\r mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another\r Dog, with a piece of meat double

undertake to find some\r favourable opportunity of effecting my escape.” At the approach of the\r evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag;\r and even the farm-bailiff

him in the hour of need.", "One of them again answered him: “We\r indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over.", "There is one other\r yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and\r until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril.” At that\r moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his\r oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried\r out: “Why is there such a scarcity of fodder?", "There is not half enough\r straw for them to lie on.", "Those lazy fellows have not even swept the\r cobwebs away.” While he thus examined everything in turn, he spied the\r tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw.", "Then\r summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be seized and\r killed.",

the Housedog a large share of his spoil.", "The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at this, reproached his companion,\r saying, “It is very hard to have all this labor, while you, who do not\r assist in the chase, luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions.” The\r Housedog replied, “Do not blame me, my friend, but find fault with the\r master, who has not taught me to labor, but to depend for

“These,” he made answer, “are worthy companions of\r yourself, fit at least to be ambassadors and leaders of armies.” The\r Ape and all his court, gratified with the lie, commanded that a\r handsome present be given to the flatterer.", "On this the truthful\r Traveler thought to himself, “If so great a reward be given for a lie,\r with what gift may not I be rewarded, if, according to my custom,

said, “I will come myself tomorrow\r with my laborers, and with as many reapers as I can hire, and will get\r in the harvest.” The Lark on hearing these words said to her brood, “It\r is time now to

a tame Partridge for sale.", "He purchased it and brought it home to be\r reared with his Gamecocks.", "When the Partridge was put into the\r poultry-yard, they struck at it and followed it about, so that the\r Partridge became grievously troubled and supposed that he was thus\r evilly treated because he was a stranger.", "Not long afterwards he saw\r the Cocks fighting together and not separating before one had well\r beaten the other.", "He then said to himself, “I shall no longer distress\r myself at being struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they\r cannot even refrain from quarreling with each other.”\r \r \r \r \r The Fox and the Lion\r \r \r A FOX saw a Lion confined in a cage, and standing near him, bitterly\r reviled him.", "The Lion said to the Fox, “It is not thou

gait and wrinkled skin?”\r \r \r \r \r The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox\r \r \r A LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave.", "All the beasts came to visit\r their king, except the Fox.", "The Wolf therefore, thinking that he had a\r capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of not paying any\r respect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to\r visit him.", "At that very moment the Fox came in and heard these last\r words of the Wolf.", "The Lion roaring out in a rage against him, the Fox\r sought an opportunity to defend himself and said, “And who of all those\r who have come to you have benefited you so much as I, who have traveled\r from place to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt from\r the physicians the means of healing you?” The Lion commanded him\r immediately to tell him the cure, when he replied, “You must flay a\r wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you.” The Wolf was at once\r taken and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile,\r “You should have moved your master not to ill, but to good, will.”\r \r \r \r \r The Dog’s House\r \r \r IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as

and the Sun disputed as to which was the most powerful,\r and agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip\r a wayfaring man of his clothes.", "The North Wind first tried his power\r and blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the\r Traveler wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all\r hope of victory, the Wind called upon the Sun to see what he could do.", "The Sun suddenly shone out with all his warmth.", "The Traveler no sooner\r felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another, and at\r last, fairly overcome

\r \r The Fox and the Crane\r \r \r A FOX invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his\r entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a\r broad flat stone dish.", "The soup fell out of the long bill of the Crane\r at every mouthful, and his vexation at not being able to eat afforded\r the Fox much amusement.", "The Crane, in his turn, asked the Fox to sup\r with him, and set before her a flagon with a long narrow mouth, so that\r he could easily insert his neck and enjoy its contents at his leisure.", "The Fox, unable even to taste it, met with a fitting

wisdom, counseled the Birds that when the acorn first\r began to sprout, to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it\r to grow.", "She said acorns would produce mistletoe, from which an\r irremediable poison, the bird-lime, would be extracted and by which\r they would be captured.", "The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed\r of the flax, which men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good\r to them.", "And, lastly, the Owl, seeing an archer approach, predicted\r that this man, being on foot, would contrive darts armed with feathers\r which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves.", "The\r Birds gave no credence to these warning words, but considered the Owl\r to be beside herself and said that she was mad.", "But afterwards, finding\r her words were true, they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to\r be the wisest of birds.", "Hence it is that when she appears they look to\r her as knowing all things, while she no longer gives them advice, but\r in solitude laments their past folly.", "The Goods and the Ills\r \r \r ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share\r which they each had in the affairs of

entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be\r associated with the Ills, as they had nothing in common and could not\r live together, but were engaged in unceasing warfare; and that an\r indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection.", "Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills\r should visit the earth in company with each other, but that the Goods\r should one by one enter the habitations of men.", "Hence it arises that\r Ills abound, for they come not one by one, but in troops, and by no\r means singly: while the Goods proceed from

Bramble\r \r \r A FOX was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught hold of\r a Bramble to save himself.", "Having pricked and grievously torn the soles\r of his feet, he accused the Bramble because, when he had fled to her\r for assistance, she had used him worse than the hedge itself.", "The\r Bramble, interrupting him, said, “But you really must have been out of\r your senses to fasten yourself on me, who am myself always accustomed\r to fasten upon others.”\r \r \r \r \r The Ass and the Charger\r \r \r AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully\r provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even\r that without hard work.", "But when war broke out, a heavily armed soldier\r mounted the Horse, and riding him to the charge, rushed into the very\r midst of the enemy.", "The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the\r battlefield.", "Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind,\r and commiserated the Horse.", "The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant\r \r \r THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints.", "“It is true, O\r Jupiter!” he said, “that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in shape,\r and powerful in attack.", "I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet\r furnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest,\r and what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be\r frightened by the crowing of a cock.” Jupiter replied, “Why do you\r blame me without a cause?", "I have given you all the attributes which I\r possess myself, and your courage never fails you except in this one\r instance.” On hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and,\r reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die.", "As\r these thoughts passed through his mind, he met an Elephant and came\r close to hold a conversation with him.", "After a time he observed that\r the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he inquired what was the\r matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor every now and then.", "Just at that moment a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he\r replied, “Do you see that little buzzing insect?", "If it enters my ear,\r my fate is sealed.", "I should die presently.” The Lion said, “Well, since\r so huge a beast is afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor\r wish myself dead.", "I find myself, even as I am, better off than the\r Elephant.”\r \r \r \r \r The Dog and the Oyster\r \r \r A DOG, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his mouth to its\r widest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish, supposing it\r to be an egg.", "Soon afterwards suffering great pain in his stomach, he\r said, “I deserve all this torment, for my folly in thinking that\r everything round must be an egg.”\r \r They who act without sufficient thought, will often fall into\r unsuspected danger.", "The Mules and the Robbers\r \r \r TWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along.", "One carried\r panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain.", "The\r Mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of\r the value of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells\r fastened to his neck.", "His companion followed with quiet and easy step.", "All of a sudden Robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places, and\r in the scuffle with their owners, wounded with a sword the Mule\r carrying the treasure, which they greedily seized while taking no\r notice of the grain.", "The Mule which had been robbed and wounded\r bewailed his misfortunes.", "The other replied, “I am indeed glad that I\r was thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with\r any wound.”\r \r \r \r \r The Lamb and the Wolf\r \r \r A WOLF pursued a Lamb, which fled for refuge to a certain Temple.", "The\r Wolf called out to him and said, “The Priest will slay you in\r sacrifice, if he should catch you.” On which the Lamb replied, “It\r would be better for me to be sacrificed in the Temple than to be eaten\r by you.”\r \r \r \r \r The Partridge and the Fowler\r \r \r A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it.", "The Partridge\r earnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, “Pray, master, permit\r me to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for\r your mercy to me.” The Fowler replied, “I shall now with less scruple\r take your life, because you are willing to save it at the cost of\r betraying your friends and relations.”\r \r \r \r \r The Flea and the Man\r \r \r A MAN, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and said,\r “Who are you who dare to feed on my limbs, and to cost me so much\r trouble in catching you?” The Flea replied, “O my dear sir, pray spare\r my life, and destroy me not, for I cannot possibly do you much harm.”\r The Man, laughing, replied, “Now you shall certainly die by mine own\r hands, for no evil, whether it be small or large, ought to be\r tolerated.”\r \r \r \r \r The Rich Man and the Tanner\r \r \r A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the\r unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away.", "The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he\r would leave soon.", "But as he still continued to stay, as time went on,\r the rich man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of\r inconvenience, made no further complaints.", "The Viper and the File\r \r \r A VIPER, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools the\r means of satisfying his hunger.", "He more particularly addressed himself\r to a File, and asked of him the favour of a meal.", "The File replied,\r “You must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get\r anything from me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to\r give anything in return.”\r \r The covetous are  poor givers.", "The Lion and the Shepherd\r \r \r A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn.", "Soon afterward he\r came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to\r say, “I am a suppliant, and seek your aid.” The Shepherd boldly\r examined the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his\r lap, pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into\r the forest.", "Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false\r accusation, was condemned “to be cast to the Lions” as the punishment\r for his imputed crime.", "But when the Lion was released from his cage, he\r recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of\r attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap.", "The King,\r as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in\r the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his\r friends.", "The Camel and Jupiter\r \r \r THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him and\r wished that he himself could obtain the same honours.", "He went to\r Jupiter, and besought him to give him horns.", "Jupiter, vexed at his\r request because he was not satisfied with his size and strength of\r body, and desired yet more, not only refused to give him horns, but\r even deprived him of a portion of his ears.", "The Panther and the Shepherds\r \r \r A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit.", "The Shepherds discovered\r him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while\r others, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no\r one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life.", "At night\r they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on\r the morrow they would find him dead.", "The Panther, however, when he had\r recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from\r the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps.", "After a few days he\r came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who\r had attacked him, raged with angry fury.", "Then they who had spared his\r life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and\r begged only for their lives.", "To them the Panther made this reply: “I\r remember alike those who sought my life with stones, and those who gave\r me food aside, therefore, your fears.", "I return as an enemy only to\r those who injured me.”\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle and the Kite\r \r \r AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree in\r company with a Kite.", "“Why,” said the Kite, “do I see you with such a\r rueful look?” “I seek,” she replied, “a mate suitable for me, and am\r not able to find one.” “Take me,” returned the Kite, “I am much\r stronger than you are.” “Why, are you able to secure the means of\r living by your plunder?” “Well, I have often caught and carried away an\r ostrich in my talons.” The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted\r him as her mate.", "Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, “Fly off\r and bring me back the ostrich you promised me.” The Kite, soaring aloft\r into the air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from\r the length of time it had lain about the fields.", "“Is this,” said the\r Eagle, “the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?” The Kite\r replied, “That I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing that I\r would not have promised, however much I knew that I must fail in the\r performance.”\r \r \r \r \r The Eagle and His Captor\r \r \r AN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his wings\r and put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which\r treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief.", "Later, another\r neighbor purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again.", "The\r Eagle took flight, and pouncing upon a hare, brought it at once as an\r offering to his benefactor.", "A Fox, seeing this, exclaimed, “Do not\r cultivate the favour of this man, but of your former owner, lest he\r should again hunt for you and deprive you a second time of your wings.”\r \r \r \r \r The King’s Son and the Painted Lion\r \r \r A KING, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in\r which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion.", "Afraid the\r dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and\r adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized\r animals, among which was the picture of a lion.", "When the young Prince\r saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and,\r standing near the lion, he said: “O you most detestable of animals!", "through a lying dream of my father’s, which he saw in his sleep, I am\r shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl: what\r shall I now do to you?” With these words he stretched out his hands\r toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that\r he might beat the lion.", "But one of the tree’s prickles pierced his\r finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince\r fell down in a fainting fit.", "A violent fever suddenly set in, from\r which he died not many days later.", "We had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them.", "The Cat and Venus\r \r \r A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus to\r change her into the form of a woman.", "Venus consented to her request and\r transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the youth saw her and\r loved her, and took her home as his bride.", "While the two were reclining\r in their chamber, Venus wishing to discover if the Cat in her change of\r shape had also altered her habits of life, let down a mouse in the\r middle of the room.", "The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition,\r started up from the couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it.", "Venus was much disappointed and again caused her to return to her\r former shape.", "Nature exceeds nurture.", "The Eagle and the Beetle\r \r \r THE EAGLE and the Beetle were at enmity together, and they destroyed\r one another’s nests.", "The Eagle gave the first provocation in seizing\r upon and in eating the young ones of the Beetle.", "The Beetle got by\r stealth at the Eagle’s eggs, and rolled them out of the nest, and\r followed the Eagle even into the presence of Jupiter.", "On the Eagle\r making his complaint, Jupiter ordered him to make his nest in his lap;\r and while Jupiter had the eggs in his lap, the Beetle came flying about\r him, and Jupiter rising up unawares, to drive him away from his head,\r threw down the eggs, and broke them.", "The weak often revenge themselves on those who use them ill, even\r though they be more powerful.", "The She-Goats and Their Beards\r \r \r THE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, the\r He-Goats were sorely displeased and made complaint that the females\r equaled them in dignity.", "“Allow them,” said Jupiter, “to enjoy an empty\r honour and to assume the badge of your nobler sex, so long as they are\r not your equals in strength or courage.”\r \r It matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should be\r like us in outside appearances.", "The Bald Man and the Fly\r \r \r A FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy it,\r gave himself a heavy slap.", "Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, “You who\r have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect,\r see what you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?” The Bald\r Man replied, “I can easily make peace with myself, because I know there\r was no intention to hurt.", "But you, an ill-favoured and contemptible\r insect who delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have\r killed you even if I had incurred a heavier penalty.”\r \r \r \r \r The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea\r \r \r A SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept after\r his buffetings with the deep.", "After a while he awoke, and looking upon\r the Sea, loaded it with reproaches.", "He argued that it enticed men with\r the calmness of its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its\r waters, it grew rough and destroyed them.", "The Sea, assuming the form of\r a woman, replied to him: “Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for\r I am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the\r winds suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into\r fury.”\r \r \r \r \r The Buffoon and the Countryman\r \r \r A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to the people,\r and gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who\r invented a new amusement for the occasion.", "Various public performers\r contended for the prize.", "Among them came a Buffoon well known among the\r populace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment\r which had never been brought out on any stage before.", "This report being\r spread about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every\r part.", "The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any\r apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused an\r intense silence.", "He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and\r imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice that\r the audience declared he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded\r that it should be shaken out.", "When that was done and nothing was found,\r they cheered the actor, and loaded him with the loudest applause.", "A\r Countryman in the crowd, observing all that has passed, said, “So help\r me, Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!” and at once\r proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day, though in a\r much more natural way.", "On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in\r the theater, but now partiality for their favourite actor very\r generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the\r Countryman than to see the spectacle.", "Both of the performers appeared\r on the stage.", "The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and\r obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the\r spectators.", "Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he\r concealed a little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but\r not suspected by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull\r his ear causing the pig to squeak.", "The Crowd, however, cried out with\r one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and\r clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater.", "On this\r the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the\r most positive proof the greatness of their mistake.", "“Look here,” he\r said, “this shows what sort of judges you are.”\r \r \r \r \r The Crow and the Serpent\r \r \r A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny nook, and\r flying down, greedily seized him.", "The Serpent, turning about, bit the\r Crow with a mortal wound.", "In the agony of death, the bird exclaimed: “O\r unhappy me!", "who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the\r source of my destruction.”\r \r \r \r \r The Hunter and the Horseman\r \r \r A CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his shoulders\r and set out homewards.", "On his way he met a man on horseback who begged\r the hare of him, under the pretense of purchasing it.", "However, when the\r Horseman got the hare, he rode off as fast as he could.", "The Hunter ran\r after him, as if he was sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman\r increased more and more the distance between them.", "The Hunter, sorely\r against his will, called out to him and said, “Get along with you!", "for\r I will now make you a present of the hare.”\r \r \r \r \r The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree\r \r \r THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all\r the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons.", "A\r shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage,\r it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at\r once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree.", "But finding the\r Fig-Tree denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and\r did not injure it at all.", "The Frogs’ Complaint Against the Sun\r \r \r ONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun

These apples were always counted, and about\r the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\r of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\r gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\r eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in\r the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\r ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\r another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\r the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\r to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\r under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\r noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\r it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son\r jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\r only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.\r The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\r council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\r all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no\r use to me, I must have the whole bird.’\r \r Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\r bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\r wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\r bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,\r for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and\r that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the\r evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\r other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\r there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\r to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can\r such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at\r the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\r ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\r the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\r singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\r and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby\r house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,\r and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\r \r Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\r were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\r to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\r to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\r the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\r withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\r his country in the same manner.\r \r Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\r the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\r listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\r was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\r coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\r not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\r the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\r attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my\r tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to\r run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\r whistled in the wind.\r \r When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and\r without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\r night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\r was beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come\r to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\r snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\r on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\r close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\r bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\r you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\r young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\r their hair whistled in the wind.\r \r Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\r and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\r below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\r lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a\r very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so\r he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.\r But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\r they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning\r the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\r die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\r swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\r given him for his own.\r \r So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\r when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now\r what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will\r still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\r I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the\r horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep\r and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old\r leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’\r Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock\r and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\r \r All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\r saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity\r to put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good one,’\r said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the\r groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took\r him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court\r to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he\r could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the\r bird and the horse given him for his own.\r \r Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why\r did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\r both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\r straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\r o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\r and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\r you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’\r Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\r and stone till their hair whistled again.\r \r As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\r o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the\r kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears\r that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,\r but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last\r he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards\r awoke and he was taken prisoner again.\r \r Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never\r have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops\r the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world\r could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had\r done very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; I\r will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;\r so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was\r removed he must give him the princess.\r \r Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man\r and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all\r three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man,\r ‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’\r \r ‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you come\r to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here\r she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden\r horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of\r them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on\r to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as\r fast as you can.’\r \r All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where\r the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\r ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\r horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that\r you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and\r when you get it into your hand, ride away.’\r \r This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\r princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\r came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the\r young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give\r you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\r and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’\r thought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’\r \r He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\r he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and\r uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men\r are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\r his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any\r way be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his\r money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to\r think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\r given up, and went on with him towards their home.\r \r And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\r cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the\r side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,\r ‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\r river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\r down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\r home to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our\r labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\r eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.\r \r The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was\r nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\r that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,\r and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\r have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\r of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\r to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill\r you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor\r man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the\r doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\r left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his\r brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\r princess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to\r his kingdom.\r \r A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\r met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\r off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\r fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\r princess, who had been lost a great many many years.\r \r \r \r \r HANS IN LUCK\r \r \r Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\r right--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\r swans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\r will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\r much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\r they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it\r know about the matter?\r \r One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\r worked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I\r must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\r and let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good\r servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump\r of silver as big as his head.\r \r Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\r threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he\r went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\r trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a\r fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy\r as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\r stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did\r not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,\r friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to\r carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up\r my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say\r of making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse,\r and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\r trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my\r heart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\r thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’\r However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\r the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When\r you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\r “Jip!”’\r \r Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\r elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\r minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\r \r  ‘No care and no sorrow,\r   A fig for the morrow!\r   We’ll laugh and be merry,\r   Sing neigh down derry!’\r \r After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\r smacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and\r before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\r back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\r was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\r himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\r shepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\r a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\r his neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\r deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\r spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\r not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that\r cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\r into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said\r the shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\r horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\r myself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart that good man\r has!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\r and the cow good morning, and away he rode.\r \r Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\r then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\r one. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\r able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\r it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\r can I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\r bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had\r rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s\r village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\r last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\r an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\r clave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought\r he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the\r stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\r was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\r him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had\r not thought of looking to that.\r \r While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\r clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\r last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\r lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\r pig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the\r butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he\r was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then\r the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh\r yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old\r beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said\r Hans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and\r give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate\r cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like\r that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\r something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said\r the butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\r neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\r pig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’\r said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\r wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\r its leg.\r \r So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\r with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.\r How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\r last got?\r \r The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\r countryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;\r and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\r how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then\r began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\r christening. ‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\r weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\r it has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in\r his hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the\r countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he,\r ‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing\r you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I\r just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\r dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If\r you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least\r they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?’\r \r Poor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out\r of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\r but he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this\r country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought\r to have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat\r goose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\r that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then\r he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\r while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’\r thought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig\r it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I\r have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;\r then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\r are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,\r and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my\r mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.’\r \r As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\r working and singing,\r \r  ‘O’er hill and o’er dale\r   So happy I roam,\r   Work light and live well,\r   All the world is my home;\r   Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’\r \r Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well\r off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the\r other, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\r into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\r beautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where\r did you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a\r horse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my\r head for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh! I worked hard for that seven long\r years.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder,\r ‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\r in it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be\r managed?’ ‘How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other;\r ‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one\r that is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\r value of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said\r Hans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\r whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there’s\r the goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\r that lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\r enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’\r \r Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\r sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born\r in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.\r People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\r letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’\r \r Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\r last penny in his joy at getting the cow.\r \r At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\r dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\r water, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\r the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\r little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.\r \r For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\r up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\r with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\r the ugly heavy stone.\r \r ‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he\r got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\r he reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to\r good luck was.\r \r \r \r \r JORINDA AND JORINDEL\r \r \r There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\r wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take\r any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of\r an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\r became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred\r paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step\r till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given\r her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came\r within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her\r into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were\r seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with\r beautiful birds in them.\r \r Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\r than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\r lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\r to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\r alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near\r to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\r setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\r the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\r birches.\r \r Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\r both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\r parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when\r they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\r at a loss to know what path to take.\r \r The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\r the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\r bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\r walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.\r Jorinda was just singing,\r \r  ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\r   Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\r   He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,\r   Well-a-day!’\r \r when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\r beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\r with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\r round them, and three times screamed:\r \r  ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’\r \r Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\r weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;\r the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\r old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\r chin that almost met one another.\r \r She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\r with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\r what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\r where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\r voice:\r \r  ‘Till the prisoner is fast,\r   And her doom is cast,\r   There stay! Oh, stay!\r   When the charm is around her,\r   And the spell has bound her,\r   Hie away! away!’\r \r On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\r before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\r she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\r went her way.\r \r He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what\r will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\r a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time\r did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\r but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\r \r At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\r and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\r plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\r that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\r found his Jorinda again.\r \r In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\r this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\r on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\r flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\r pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\r night, till he came again to the castle.\r \r He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\r fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.\r Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with\r the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,\r and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the\r chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in\r the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\r screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\r the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at\r the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then\r should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to\r do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the\r best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched\r the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her\r arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when\r they walked together in the wood.\r \r Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\r took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\r married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\r other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s\r cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.\r \r \r \r \r THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS\r \r \r An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\r a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\r unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\r began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\r mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\r towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’\r \r After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\r roadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my\r friend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to\r knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\r myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\r earn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great\r city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\r do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\r together.\r \r They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\r road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,\r ‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’\r said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in\r danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\r ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\r laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\r enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’\r ‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are\r a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat\r was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\r \r Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\r perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\r ‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\r is all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that\r we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\r the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\r head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\r on Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master\r Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\r your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\r may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my\r heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\r \r They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\r night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\r themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\r branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\r should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\r his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\r see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something\r bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a\r house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said\r the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\r best in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the\r worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together\r towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\r near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\r house in which a gang of robbers lived.\r \r The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\r peeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What\r do I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\r good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would\r be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we\r could only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive\r to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed\r himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\r window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s\r shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When\r all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass\r brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\r they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\r the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The\r robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\r had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\r and scampered away as fast as they could.\r \r The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\r the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\r to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\r put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\r his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\r the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\r cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\r cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\r rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\r \r But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\r out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\r too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\r the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he\r marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\r order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\r the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\r light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\r and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away\r he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\r leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\r cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At\r this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\r the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\r him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\r knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\r in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\r club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\r ‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go\r back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\r that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\r this very day.\r \r \r \r \r OLD SULTAN\r \r \r A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\r and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife\r were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot\r old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife\r said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a\r great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of\r his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not\r a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to\r be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;\r tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’\r \r Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\r and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\r tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\r friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,\r and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself\r easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,\r you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\r field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\r behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie\r down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come\r out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as\r you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they\r will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you\r that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this\r plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the\r child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\r soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\r and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old\r Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live\r and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and\r give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on\r as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he\r could wish for.\r \r Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my\r good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\r when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’\r said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf\r thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But\r Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\r for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for\r a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed\r his locks for him finely.\r \r Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and\r swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the\r boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now\r Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old\r three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped\r along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.\r \r The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\r espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing\r straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\r fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\r a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\r fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\r up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\r wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden\r himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\r them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\r mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\r up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there\r sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf\r sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\r and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\r himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.\r \r \r \r \r THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\r \r \r In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\r of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and\r that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.\r When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\r observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\r a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw\r began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal\r replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\r by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\r burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,\r but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\r into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better\r fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has\r destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\r once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’\r \r ‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.\r \r ‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped\r death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\r mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\r repair to a foreign country.’\r \r The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\r together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\r no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\r it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight\r across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw\r therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\r who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\r newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\r water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\r and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\r two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed\r when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had\r prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\r was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would\r have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\r was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.\r As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\r and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\r tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.\r \r \r \r \r BRIAR ROSE\r \r \r A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\r where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had\r plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\r good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but\r though they had been married many years they had no children, and this\r grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking\r by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\r little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\r and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little\r fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\r it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,\r and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\r soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to\r pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\r could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\r feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked\r his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen\r said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good\r to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;\r but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat\r out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.\r So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red\r shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:\r and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all\r their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another\r beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\r world.\r \r Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\r the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\r come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\r broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.\r Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\r scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\r revenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\r year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of\r the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\r said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\r mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle\r wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\r hundred years.\r \r However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\r the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\r should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven\r fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\r beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew\r her loved her.\r \r It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\r and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she\r roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till\r at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase\r ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when\r she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning\r away very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what\r are you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her\r head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that\r little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle\r and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the\r fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell\r down lifeless on the ground.\r \r However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\r the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\r fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\r the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\r the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\r sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\r goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\r at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\r on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\r asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the\r jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\r \r A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\r became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\r and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But\r there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\r Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to\r time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\r into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\r thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\r they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\r \r After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an\r old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\r palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\r lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard\r from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\r break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\r died. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I\r will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but\r he was bent upon going.\r \r Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\r to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\r which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.\r Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\r asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\r the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he\r came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\r was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\r to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\r plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\r if she was going to beat the boy.\r \r Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\r every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\r the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\r fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\r could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\r But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\r upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\r awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.\r And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\r pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\r flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\r the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\r with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\r draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave\r the boy the box on his ear.\r \r And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\r was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.\r \r \r \r \r THE DOG AND THE SPARROW\r \r \r A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\r suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he\r took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.\r On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,\r my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have\r nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me\r into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they\r went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,\r the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you\r down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\r first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\r pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\r till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\r away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said\r the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\r the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had\r eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you\r had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should\r like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’\r said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him\r to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\r they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\r another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the\r sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and\r now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went\r out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\r far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a\r nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime\r I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the\r road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\r a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The\r sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\r go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\r out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the\r carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!\r what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\r dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the\r sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\r mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’\r ‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’\r and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\r pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\r all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked\r round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.\r ‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\r the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\r pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,\r he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\r her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head\r with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’\r cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter\r went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the\r cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine\r ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch\r that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and\r perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The\r carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she\r flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the\r spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\r the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him\r too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or\r caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his\r third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I\r am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew\r away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The\r carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\r overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what\r ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\r dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into\r the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am\r sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it\r up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of\r birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\r midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw\r that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the\r sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.\r \r The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\r into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat\r himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat\r on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost\r thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,\r and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the\r window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\r cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and\r blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\r cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\r and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\r glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\r touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the\r wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting\r her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\r her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\r and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he\r could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,\r strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but\r she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\r dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.\r \r \r \r \r THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\r \r \r There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\r twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\r shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\r worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\r could find out how it happened, or where they had been.\r \r Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\r discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\r danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\r wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\r succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\r \r A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was\r taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\r twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;\r and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door\r of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and\r when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\r dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing\r happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\r cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\r and all lost their lives in the same manner.\r \r Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\r and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\r reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\r who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or\r what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very\r well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\r I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard\r task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\r princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\r you pretend to be fast asleep.’\r \r Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on\r you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\r princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good\r counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\r he was willing to undertake the task.\r \r He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\r fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\r to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\r the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\r away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\r down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\r he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\r heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser\r thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened\r their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\r dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\r to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while\r you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will\r befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;\r have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?\r And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping\r draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’\r \r When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\r snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\r quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,\r and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier\r saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest\r leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put\r on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;\r but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest\r princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone\r took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is\r nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the\r bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and\r the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.\r The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke\r off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the\r youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you\r hear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It\r is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’\r \r Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\r gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\r diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\r was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\r the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\r So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\r lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\r who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\r \r One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\r the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\r prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\r said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\r we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat\r seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the\r princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’\r \r On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\r which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,\r and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\r the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and\r when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it\r all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,\r too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always\r silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then\r all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.\r The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\r soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the\r opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising\r to come again the next night.\r \r When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\r and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very\r much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all\r is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine\r clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the\r soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more\r of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;\r and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\r till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,\r on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a\r token of where he had been.\r \r As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\r before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the\r twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would\r say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at\r night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And\r then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three\r branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king\r called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said\r was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was\r of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king\r asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he\r answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they\r were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s\r heir.\r \r \r \r \r THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE\r \r \r There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\r by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and\r one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling\r waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away\r deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.\r But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an\r enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’\r said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will\r have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon\r as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted\r straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him\r on the wave.\r \r When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how\r he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\r prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not\r you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,\r in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\r little cottage.’\r \r The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\r seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\r green. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!\r   Hearken to me!\r   My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?\r What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when\r I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let\r you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants\r a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the\r cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the\r door of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is\r not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a\r parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there\r was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and\r there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the\r fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at\r least,’ said his wife.\r \r Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\r ‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\r courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\r have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him\r to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to\r him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this\r pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it\r very willingly, I know; go along and try!’\r \r The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\r the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went\r close to the edge of the waves, and said:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!\r   Hearken to me!\r   My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man,\r dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’\r said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went\r the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\r castle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into\r the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the\r rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and\r behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a\r mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the\r courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we\r will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of\r our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,\r before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.\r \r The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\r she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,\r and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’\r said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’\r ‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you\r be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say\r no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away\r quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time\r the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves\r and the ridges of foam as he cried out:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!\r   Hearken to me!\r   My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor\r man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king\r already.’\r \r Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw\r a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when\r he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,\r with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six\r fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the\r fisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had\r looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it\r is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long\r as we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long\r time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\r think I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to\r be emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!\r I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish\r cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\r such a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go\r at once!’\r \r So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\r ‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\r tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He\r soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\r a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\r went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!\r   Hearken to me!\r   My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,\r ‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor\r already.’\r \r So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\r sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\r her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards\r and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the\r tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And\r before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\r up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am\r emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing\r it is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being\r emperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be\r pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said\r she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the\r fish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make\r an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’\r \r So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\r and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were\r in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the\r middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards\r the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight\r the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his\r knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and\r said:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!\r   Hearken to me!\r   My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my\r wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’\r \r Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\r that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and\r around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side\r of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as\r large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no\r larger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked\r at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’\r ‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now\r you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about\r that,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not\r sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she\r was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she,\r as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot\r prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened\r her husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must\r be lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the\r thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.\r ‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’\r said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my\r leave. Go to the fish at once!’\r \r Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to\r the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\r shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\r lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\r the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\r white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\r and cried out, as well as he could:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!\r   Hearken to me!\r   My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to\r be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty\r again.’\r \r And there they live to this very day.\r \r \r \r \r THE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR\r \r \r Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\r and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother\r wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’\r said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was\r the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very\r much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not\r done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until\r the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in\r her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young\r ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him\r back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady\r Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the\r nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he\r had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it\r again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw\r five or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried\r the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you\r are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were\r frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are\r honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’\r \r The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\r holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\r when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as\r touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\r settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\r here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall\r be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and\r called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\r suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was\r announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\r part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\r contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\r air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\r flies had to come.\r \r When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies\r to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was\r the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,\r and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be\r announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him\r and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be\r general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we\r agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long\r bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift\r my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\r let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard\r that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\r detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,\r all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the\r earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\r the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\r was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\r other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle\r beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt\r the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\r he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\r sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\r hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When\r the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each\r into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\r \r Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\r ‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won\r the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear\r must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable\r children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the\r bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my\r children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall\r be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged\r their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat\r down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the\r night.\r \r \r \r \r THE FROG-PRINCE\r \r \r One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\r out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\r spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down\r to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\r favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\r catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that\r she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\r along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\r princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\r deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail\r her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would\r give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\r world.’\r \r Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\r ‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you\r do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’\r The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;\r but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off\r your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball\r again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is\r talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\r he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\r shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will\r bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head\r down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\r up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\r spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\r it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\r never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.\r The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\r said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.\r \r The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\r strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\r marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\r door, and a little voice cried out and said:\r \r  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r   Open the door to thy true love here!\r   And mind the words that thou and I said\r   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r \r Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\r the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\r frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\r seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\r asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at\r the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\r told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\r get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\r in.’\r \r While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\r \r  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r   Open the door to thy true love here!\r   And mind the words that thou and I said\r   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r \r Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word\r you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped\r into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\r bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\r the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,\r ‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog\r said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This\r she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am\r tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,\r though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\r pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was\r light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.\r ‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be\r troubled with him no more.’\r \r But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\r tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\r \r  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r   Open the door to thy true love here!\r   And mind the words that thou and I said\r   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r \r And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\r her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did\r the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\r astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\r with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\r of her bed.\r \r He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\r changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\r some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\r her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the\r prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\r but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will\r marry you, and love you as long as you live.’\r \r The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to\r all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\r horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\r the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\r the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\r bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\r \r They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\r horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s\r kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\r many years.\r \r \r \r \r CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r \r \r A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\r to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\r length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\r ‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\r from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture\r everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice\r was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\r to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no\r place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\r dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\r and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was\r placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\r yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,\r little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\r asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\r him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\r after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all\r means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\r should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,\r however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\r be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\r began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\r walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\r stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\r of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.\r ‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a\r merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they\r give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried\r the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\r your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse\r than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’\r \r Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\r the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\r a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\r white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,\r but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\r half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\r oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When\r she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’\r ‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I\r never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the\r calendar!’\r \r The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good\r things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.\r The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\r exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\r happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!\r Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me\r very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey\r fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because\r you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse\r cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\r emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some\r peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\r home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\r the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the\r cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the\r most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\r what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\r down to sleep.\r \r From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\r when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\r outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,\r we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\r shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much\r as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\r window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\r fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the\r mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\r friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\r top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the\r cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on\r the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\r on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of\r the world.\r \r \r \r \r THE GOOSE-GIRL\r \r \r The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\r only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\r mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good\r fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\r over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\r great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\r got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her\r mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\r silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\r royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\r her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.\r Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,\r and could speak.\r \r When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\r bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\r and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for\r it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took\r a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\r her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\r bridegroom’s kingdom.\r \r One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\r feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch\r me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\r drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\r stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\r longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\r little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\r her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’\r And the lock answered her, and said:\r \r  ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\r maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\r \r Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\r the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\r and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude\r speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\r my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\r than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’\r Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\r down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\r ‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:\r \r  ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\r and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did\r not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\r charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\r she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would\r have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,\r and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her\r horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\r maid’s shabby ones.\r \r At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\r servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\r happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\r \r Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\r other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\r royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\r meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\r who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;\r but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\r \r Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\r amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\r going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\r and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\r to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left\r standing in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her\r company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,\r that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think\r of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes\r care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,\r that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was\r Curdken.\r \r But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one\r piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of\r your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\r was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,\r she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and\r tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the\r faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she\r wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large\r dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning\r and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the\r slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and\r nailed it up under the dark gate.\r \r Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\r she said sorrowfully:\r \r  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r \r and the head answered:\r \r  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r   Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\r came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\r waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\r saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the\r locks out, but she cried:\r \r  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\r   Let Curdken’s hat go!\r   Blow, breezes, blow!\r   Let him after it go!\r   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r   Away be it whirl’d\r   Till the silvery locks\r   Are all comb’d and curl’d!\r \r Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and\r away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\r it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her\r hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,\r and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it\r grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.\r \r The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\r girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:\r \r  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r \r and the head answered:\r \r  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r   Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\r to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\r take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\r \r  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\r   Let Curdken’s hat go!\r   Blow, breezes, blow!\r   Let him after it go!\r   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r   Away be it whirl’d\r   Till the silvery locks\r   Are all comb’d and curl’d!\r \r Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\r over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\r he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they\r watched the geese till it grew dark.\r \r In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\r said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\r longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she\r does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him\r what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through\r the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\r of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\r \r  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r \r and the head answers:\r \r  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r   Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\r where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\r to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the\r old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning\r came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke\r to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and\r hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own\r eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,\r she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her\r say:\r \r  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\r   Let Curdken’s hat go!\r   Blow, breezes, blow!\r   Let him after it go!\r   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r   Away be it whirl’d\r   Till the silvery locks\r   Are all comb’d and curl’d!\r \r And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away\r went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\r hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\r when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\r and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That\r I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’\r \r But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\r him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very\r lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\r royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was\r so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a\r false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true\r bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and\r heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to\r the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all\r his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one\r side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her\r beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all\r like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\r \r When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\r he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\r princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\r true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would\r behave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she\r should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that\r two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to\r street till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as\r thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young\r king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the\r kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came\r to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.\r \r \r \r \r THE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET\r \r \r 1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\r \r ‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\r ‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\r before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said\r Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’\r \r So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\r there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\r nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,\r I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not\r become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little\r carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\r it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\r home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;\r I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,\r if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came\r quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have\r you in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon\r that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no\r coward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\r that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\r upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she\r agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,\r duck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good\r pace.\r \r After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\r walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’\r and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\r dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\r friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\r drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\r that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\r carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\r likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\r promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\r tread on Partlet’s toes.\r \r Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\r the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\r deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\r quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\r house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\r however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\r had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\r the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\r they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\r \r Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\r stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\r egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\r fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\r and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair\r and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\r away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open\r air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\r close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\r \r An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\r to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\r walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\r stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.\r ‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my\r head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\r easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the\r pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,\r suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\r after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\r would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\r reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\r \r \r 2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\r \r Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\r so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\r harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\r and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where\r are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,\r \r  ‘All on our way\r   A visit to pay\r   To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r \r Then the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my\r heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’\r \r  ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\r   Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\r   Now, mice, be ready,\r   And, wheels, run steady!\r   For we are going a visit to pay\r   To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r \r Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\r Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\r them.\r \r When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice\r drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\r upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\r the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\r millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\r up in the towel.\r \r When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\r the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\r wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\r when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\r over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his\r supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\r his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\r run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\r down on his head, and killed him on the spot.\r \r \r 3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\r \r Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\r to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\r should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large\r nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\r herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\r stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\r Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\r shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\r said, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\r will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,\r and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to\r the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\r the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\r lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride\r said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\r in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\r from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\r the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\r the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\r Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\r quite dead, and never moved any more.\r \r Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\r came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\r hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\r themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they\r met the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my\r Partlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but\r you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then\r the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\r all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\r \r So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get\r over?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,\r and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the\r straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\r and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came\r and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\r shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed\r so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\r stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\r offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\r and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\r managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\r who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\r and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\r \r Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\r a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.\r Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\r died too; and so all were dead.\r \r \r \r \r RAPUNZEL\r \r \r There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\r child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.\r These people had a little window at the back of their house from which\r a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\r flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\r one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\r great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was\r standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\r bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\r looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\r and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and\r asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat\r some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\r die.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,\r bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’\r At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\r enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\r wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It\r tasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\r three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband\r must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\r therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\r wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\r him. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my\r garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’\r ‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\r up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the\r window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\r had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\r softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow\r you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\r condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\r the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\r mother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\r woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\r child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\r \r Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\r twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\r a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\r little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\r beneath it and cried:\r \r  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r   Let down your hair to me.’\r \r Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\r heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\r wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\r fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\r \r After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through\r the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\r charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\r solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king’s\r son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\r but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\r touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\r listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\r that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\r \r  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r   Let down your hair to me.’\r \r Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\r climbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\r will try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow\r dark, he went to the tower and cried:\r \r  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r   Let down your hair to me.’\r \r Immediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.\r \r At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\r had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to\r her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\r that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.\r Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\r him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\r thought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said\r yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with\r you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk\r every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\r that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They\r agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\r old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until\r once Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that\r you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king’s son--he\r is with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress.\r ‘What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all\r the world, and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched\r Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,\r seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut\r off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless\r that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\r grief and misery.\r \r On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\r fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\r window, and when the king’s son came and cried:\r \r  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r   Let down your hair to me.’\r \r she let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding\r his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\r wicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch\r your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;\r the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is\r lost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son was beside\r himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He\r escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his\r eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but\r roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of\r his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\r length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she\r had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a\r voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and\r when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two\r of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could\r see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was\r joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and\r contented.\r \r \r \r \r FUNDEVOGEL\r \r \r There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as\r he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\r there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\r the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\r asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in\r her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\r \r The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\r ‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He\r took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\r one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\r had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\r when they did not see each other they were sad.\r \r Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\r began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\r to the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you\r fetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will\r tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,\r and then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester\r is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the\r kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’\r \r Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\r was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:\r ‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel\r said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then\r will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water\r into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said\r that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early\r tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle\r full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up\r quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’\r \r The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\r away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\r bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,\r and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly\r alarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the\r forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be\r followed instantly to get them back again.’\r \r Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\r overtake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the\r forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\r said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’\r Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become\r a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to\r the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\r the children were nowhere. Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done\r here,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\r in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the\r old cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the\r rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\r you; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for\r the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.\r Then Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\r you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you\r become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three\r servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in\r it. They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go\r home.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;\r so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a\r chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools! why\r did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home\r with you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with\r the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,\r saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\r after them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will\r never leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’\r Said Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook,\r however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,\r and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized\r her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old\r witch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were\r heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.\r \r \r \r \r THE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR\r \r \r One summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\r window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came\r a peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams,\r cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his\r delicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman;\r here you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps\r to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\r for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\r at length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\r ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\r consequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\r what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam\r shall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health\r and strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\r a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t\r taste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I\r take a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\r bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\r rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\r attracted and descended on it in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’ said the\r little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,\r who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\r again in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all\r patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\r and saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on\r them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\r than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that\r sort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole\r town shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\r a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at\r one stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear\r of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The tailor\r put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\r thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,\r he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\r take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\r he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which\r had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the\r cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\r he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\r reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\r peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\r and said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\r wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.\r Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously\r at the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’\r \r ‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\r showed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I\r am!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had\r been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\r for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\r a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\r of it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is\r that all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his\r hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\r the liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,\r wasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\r of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\r that the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do\r that likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone\r came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\r back at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\r and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,\r rose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you,\r comrade?’ asked the tailor. ‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant,\r ‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He\r took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\r the ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\r tree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you\r the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\r after all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his\r shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\r could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\r tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\r whistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if\r carrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the\r heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark\r you, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,\r seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\r to the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\r the tree!’\r \r They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\r hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\r down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\r tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\r it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.\r When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is\r this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no\r lack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could\r be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over\r the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.\r Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he\r could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\r that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.\r \r The giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\r cavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and\r followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\r there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\r was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much\r more spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and\r said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too\r big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\r a corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\r tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\r cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\r grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\r forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\r walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,\r they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\r great hurry.\r \r The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\r After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\r palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.\r Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\r read on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does\r the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty\r lord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\r opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\r man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased\r the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer\r him military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by\r the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,\r and then conveyed to him this proposal. ‘For this very reason have\r I come here,’ the tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’s\r service.’ He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling\r was assigned him.\r \r The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\r him a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said\r among themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\r seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\r him.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\r the king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’ said\r they, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was\r sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\r wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\r have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his\r dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people\r dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a\r long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor\r and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one\r request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,\r who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,\r and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in\r danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he\r would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a\r dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.\r ‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the\r little tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a\r kingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon\r subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen\r to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of\r two.’\r \r The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.\r When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\r ‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then\r he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a\r while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and\r snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not\r idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\r tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat\r just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on\r the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,\r but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you\r knocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking\r you.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\r threw a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried\r the other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered\r the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were\r weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The\r little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and\r threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. ‘That\r is too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\r companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in\r the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\r belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\r the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is\r a lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which\r I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a\r squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave\r each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the\r horsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them\r off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\r defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\r like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not\r wounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about\r that,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The\r horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\r found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\r torn-up trees.\r \r The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\r repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\r rid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\r kingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed. In\r the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\r it first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one\r blow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went\r forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\r wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards\r him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\r horn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as\r that,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\r close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against\r the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\r that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\r was caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out\r from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\r axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\r beast away and took it to the king.\r \r The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\r demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\r made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\r help. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not\r take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\r that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\r such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When\r the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\r whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\r fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\r once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor\r ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\r beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\r was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\r might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to\r the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his\r promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known\r that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before\r him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding\r was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a\r king was made.\r \r After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\r night: ‘Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\r will rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what\r state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained\r of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of\r her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her\r and said: ‘Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants\r shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\r him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\r world.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the king’s armour-bearer,\r who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of\r the whole plot. ‘I’ll put a screw into that business,’ said the little\r tailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and\r when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,\r and then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to\r be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make me the doublet\r and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your\r ears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one\r unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\r outside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\r were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\r behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\r him. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\r life.\r \r \r \r \r HANSEL AND GRETEL\r \r \r Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\r two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\r little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\r land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\r over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\r groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we\r to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\r ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early\r tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\r it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\r of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\r leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\r rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I\r bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\r soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we\r must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\r coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very\r sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.\r \r The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\r heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\r bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,\r Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\r to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\r on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\r shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\r glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\r little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went\r back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\r peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When\r day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the\r two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the\r forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:\r ‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\r for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,\r as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together\r on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\r stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.\r His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\r behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,\r father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is\r sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:\r ‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\r shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\r the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\r out of his pocket on the road.\r \r When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,\r children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\r be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\r little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\r very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\r fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we\r have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’\r \r Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\r piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\r believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but\r a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\r blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\r time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\r at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and\r said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted\r her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\r will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\r his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\r newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\r \r They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\r to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\r opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty\r children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\r never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\r him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\r \r Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\r land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\r father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\r is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the\r wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\r means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:\r ‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\r children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\r say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,\r and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\r also.\r \r The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\r When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\r out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\r the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his\r little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\r good God will help us.’\r \r Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\r beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\r than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\r in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\r ‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I\r am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\r wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,\r ‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\r on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\r on the path.\r \r The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\r never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\r the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\r you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\r the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When\r it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\r scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\r no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\r night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,\r Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\r which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When\r the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\r thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\r them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but\r they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\r too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\r and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\r berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\r legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\r asleep.\r \r It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They\r began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\r help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\r was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\r which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\r when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\r and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\r which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\r that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\r were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and\r have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\r some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and\r broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\r against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\r from the parlour:\r \r  ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\r   Who is nibbling at my little house?’\r \r The children answered:\r \r  ‘The wind, the wind,\r   The heaven-born wind,’\r \r and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\r taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\r the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\r it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\r supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\r so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\r hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear\r children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No\r harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them\r into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and\r pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little\r beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\r in them, and thought they were in heaven.\r \r The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\r a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\r little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\r into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\r day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\r a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.\r When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\r malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me\r again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\r already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\r pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That\r will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\r hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\r grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to\r Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch\r some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\r stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’\r Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\r forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\r \r And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\r but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\r cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\r be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and\r the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was\r Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening\r him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\r was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,\r Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.\r Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,\r how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\r and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she\r cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\r at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’\r said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’\r \r Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\r the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,\r ‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor\r Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.\r ‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that\r we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\r shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.\r But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am\r to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door\r is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and\r thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove\r her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then\r she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless\r witch was miserably burnt to death.\r \r Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\r and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel\r sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did\r rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And\r as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s\r house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\r ‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his\r pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take\r something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must\r be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’\r \r When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\r water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no\r bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white\r duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she\r cried:\r \r  ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\r   Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\r   There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\r   Take us across on thy back so white.’\r \r The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\r his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy\r for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The\r good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\r walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\r to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then\r they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\r their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had\r left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel\r emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\r room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\r add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\r in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\r catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\r \r \r \r \r THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\r \r \r Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\r partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\r they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\r considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the\r wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\r to the cooking.\r \r When people are too well off they always begin to long for something\r new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\r fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\r household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\r poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\r at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire\r and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\r until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the\r pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\r dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\r among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\r and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and\r had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\r finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\r morning: and that was really a very delightful life.\r \r Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\r the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\r and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\r change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray\r as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\r master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\r drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\r to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\r \r And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\r made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\r till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\r sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\r flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across\r a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\r booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog\r of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for\r the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and\r that was the reason his life had been forfeited.\r \r He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\r had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\r best of things and to remain with one another.\r \r So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\r wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\r out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the\r pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having\r already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\r \r Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\r could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\r here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to\r be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,\r caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,\r but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable\r to recover himself, he was drowned.\r \r \r \r \r MOTHER HOLLE\r \r \r Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\r was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\r however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\r daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\r to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\r family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\r the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\r chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\r stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\r of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her\r misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\r her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall\r into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’\r \r The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\r her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\r \r She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\r beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\r in every direction.\r \r She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven\r full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us\r out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\r ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\r \r She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.\r ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,\r are ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\r her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\r apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\r heap and walked on again.\r \r The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\r woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\r turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you\r afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\r properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\r however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\r it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\r in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman\r spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\r into her service.\r \r She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and\r every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\r feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good\r as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and\r boiled meats every day.\r \r So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\r to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\r became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\r was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\r Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went\r to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with\r you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own\r people.’\r \r Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back\r to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I\r will take you home myself.’\r \r Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\r was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\r her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\r head to foot.\r \r ‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she\r spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\r \r The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\r world close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\r cock who was perched on the well, called out:\r \r  ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r   Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’\r \r Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\r covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\r all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\r great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\r and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well\r and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\r thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\r she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.\r \r Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\r till she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall\r be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves\r as before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty\r my hands for you?’ and walked on.\r \r Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\r apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice\r thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and\r passed on.\r \r At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about\r the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\r herself without delay to the old woman.\r \r The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\r to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\r return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and\r the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in\r the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to\r make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the\r feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\r and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\r thought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,\r as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\r through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\r pouring over her.\r \r ‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut\r the gate.\r \r So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\r well called out as she saw her:\r \r  ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r   Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’\r \r But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\r her as long as she lived.\r \r \r \r \r LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\r \r \r Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\r who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\r nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\r little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\r wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’\r \r One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\r of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\r and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and\r when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\r or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\r get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good\r morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’\r \r ‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\r her hand on it.\r \r The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\r and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\r did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\r him.\r \r ‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.\r \r ‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’\r \r ‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’\r \r ‘To my grandmother’s.’\r \r ‘What have you got in your apron?’\r \r ‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\r have something good, to make her stronger.’\r \r ‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’\r \r ‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\r under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\r surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.\r \r The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice\r plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\r act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by\r the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how\r pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,\r too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\r walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\r out here in the wood is merry.’\r \r Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\r here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\r she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\r please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\r in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\r flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\r still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\r deeper into the wood.\r \r Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked\r at the door.\r \r ‘Who is there?’\r \r ‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open\r the door.’\r \r ‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot\r get up.’\r \r The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\r word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then\r he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\r and drew the curtains.\r \r Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\r and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\r remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\r \r She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\r went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\r herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\r being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but\r received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\r There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\r looking very strange.\r \r ‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’\r \r ‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.\r \r ‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.\r \r ‘The better to see you with, my dear.’\r \r ‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’\r \r ‘The better to hug you with.’\r \r ‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’\r \r ‘The better to eat you with!’\r \r And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\r bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\r \r When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\r fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\r the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must\r just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he\r came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you\r here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as\r he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\r devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\r not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\r of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little\r Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\r sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was\r inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\r also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\r great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,\r he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\r once, and fell dead.\r \r Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and\r went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\r Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As\r long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\r wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’\r \r \r It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\r grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\r path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\r her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\r had said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\r that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\r have eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door,\r that he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\r ‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\r some cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\r stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\r intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\r steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother\r saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone\r trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\r sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\r trough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the\r smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,\r and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep\r his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight\r into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,\r and no one ever did anything to harm her again.\r \r \r \r \r THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM\r \r \r There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\r grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\r for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who\r comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\r he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\r which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\r not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\r She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\r nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You\r have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\r time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is\r out there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by\r saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed\r only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\r invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\r will strew ashes along the path.’\r \r When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\r dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\r be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\r lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\r entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\r she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\r step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\r darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so\r grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped\r inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\r throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\r \r  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r \r The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\r cage on the wall. Again it cried:\r \r  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r \r The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\r all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,\r and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\r shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband\r lives here?’\r \r ‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to\r come to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,\r and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\r you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron\r of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have\r you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\r you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save\r you, you would be lost.’\r \r Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\r from view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,\r or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\r all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\r opportunity to escape.’\r \r The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\r dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\r paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,\r three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\r and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her\r dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\r pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.\r \r The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\r cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\r the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\r the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off\r easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang\r into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was\r hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he\r could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of\r the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,\r and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’\r \r ‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\r the finger and sat down.\r \r The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\r long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\r snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind\r the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who\r were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed\r dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she\r passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,\r opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’\r den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and\r lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide\r them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it\r was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father\r all that had happened.\r \r The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom\r arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\r care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,\r each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did\r not say a word.\r \r ‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no\r tale you know? Tell us something.’\r \r ‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a\r forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but\r a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\r \r  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r \r and again a second time it said these words.’\r \r ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r \r ‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\r and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the\r cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\r head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,\r “Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed\r does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards\r cook and eat you.”’\r \r ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r \r ‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\r this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\r them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\r yellow, and with that she died.’\r \r ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r \r ‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\r pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’\r \r ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r \r ‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\r finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut\r off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the\r great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And\r with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\r assembled guests.\r \r The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\r tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\r delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\r condemned to death for their wicked deeds.\r \r \r \r \r TOM THUMB\r \r \r A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\r fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is,\r wife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me\r to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\r us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’\r ‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round\r her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\r ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\r happy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\r pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\r had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\r quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So\r they said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\r little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas\r Thumb.\r \r They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\r bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\r Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\r be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\r \r One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\r fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\r want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;\r the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman\r laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s\r bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only\r harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\r go.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’\r \r When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\r Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\r to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse\r went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\r wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\r was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd\r thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a\r carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,\r indeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it\r goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\r place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\r out, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take\r me down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\r the other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a\r straw, where he sat as merry as you please.\r \r The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\r to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That\r little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\r about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to\r the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He\r will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell\r him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\r than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the\r bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder\r and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;\r I’ll soon come back to you.’\r \r So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\r large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to\r sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be\r a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we\r go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\r father they took him away with them.\r \r They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\r said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and\r put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\r road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into\r an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and\r look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place,\r and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;\r Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite\r dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as\r sulky as could be.\r \r When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What\r dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to\r fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’\r At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is\r lucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.\r \r Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\r together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s\r house of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise\r was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’\r They stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll\r soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said\r they. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the\r sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him\r up in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for\r us?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house,\r and throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the\r thieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’\r \r When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the\r window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\r ‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,\r and said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’\r But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,\r ‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in\r the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and\r listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little\r way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little\r urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and\r whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your\r roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out\r as loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’\r \r The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\r open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and\r the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.\r By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when\r she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found\r nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her\r eyes open.\r \r The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\r place to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\r to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\r mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows\r happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,\r to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away\r a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast\r asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found\r himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the\r cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good\r lack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon\r found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about\r him, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to\r death. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said\r he; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a\r candle would be no bad thing.’\r \r Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\r all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\r down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he\r cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring\r me any more hay!’\r \r The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\r speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\r that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\r her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself\r up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\r parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson\r said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the\r cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\r \r Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t\r bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and\r thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\r spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\r lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\r \r Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\r task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\r ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\r whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\r \r Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\r not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\r out, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’\r said the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own\r father’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and\r then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold\r chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can\r wish.’\r \r The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\r the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into\r the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As soon as\r he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that\r he could not go out by the same way he came in.\r \r This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\r great shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the\r wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’\r ‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now\r I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as\r loud as he could.\r \r The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\r a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\r suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\r axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman,\r ‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the\r scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here,\r the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we\r have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the\r scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and\r struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was\r dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father,\r ‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have\r travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we\r parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’\r ‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a\r mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the\r wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’\r \r ‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again\r for all the riches in the world.’\r \r Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\r to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\r clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.\r So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for\r though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many\r fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always\r agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!\r \r \r \r \r RUMPELSTILTSKIN\r \r \r By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\r of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was\r close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.\r She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\r of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\r hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now\r this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast\r his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\r him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\r heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must\r be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain\r that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\r for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\r door was locked, and she was left alone.\r \r She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\r fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\r hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\r weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and\r I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it\r for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,\r and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\r \r  ‘Round about, round about,\r     Lo and behold!\r   Reel away, reel away,\r     Straw into gold!’\r \r And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\r the straw was all spun into gold.\r \r When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\r but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\r miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\r and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\r said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’\r said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\r wheel again, and whistled and sang:\r \r  ‘Round about, round about,\r     Lo and behold!\r   Reel away, reel away,\r     Straw into gold!’\r \r till, long before morning, all was done again.\r \r The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\r but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet\r larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\r you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and\r said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’\r ‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said\r the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are\r queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she\r knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he\r asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once\r more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding\r all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s\r daughter, and she really became queen.\r \r At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\r dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where\r she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then\r she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all\r the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at\r last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’\r grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your\r child.’\r \r Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\r she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\r out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with\r TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\r remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my\r name.’\r \r The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\r BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\r still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’\r \r The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have\r travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as\r I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox\r and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before\r the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was\r dancing upon one leg, and singing:\r \r  “Merrily the feast I’ll make.\r   Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;\r   Merrily I’ll dance and sing,\r   For next day will a stranger bring.\r   Little does my lady dream\r   Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”\r \r When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\r friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\r to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\r arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began\r to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with\r him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my\r name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’\r ‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?’ said the\r lady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried\r the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\r floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\r out.\r \r Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\r baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\r trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a\r merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’\r \r \r \r \r CLEVER GRETEL\r \r \r There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\r when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\r was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when\r she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,\r and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she\r was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what\r the food is like.’\r \r It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a\r guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will\r see to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,\r plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\r the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\r nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out\r to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\r from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\r the moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run\r myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,\r Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing\r so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\r when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\r drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’\r and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\r not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.\r \r Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\r and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\r Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’\r She touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It\r certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\r time!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\r his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\r ‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’\r So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\r thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\r something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and\r looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\r her: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\r somewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\r been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\r eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’\r So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\r one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\r and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\r ‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s\r right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\r another draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty\r drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\r \r While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry\r up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will\r soon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that\r the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\r going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently\r the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.\r Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\r she put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly\r as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\r certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\r two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest\r heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\r could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\r ‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by\r that?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just\r going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a\r nice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had\r but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to\r him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him\r with the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning\r that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The\r guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of\r his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take\r them both with him.\r \r \r \r \r THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\r \r \r There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\r of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\r hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\r out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so\r the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\r and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\r of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\r tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\r fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said\r nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\r half-pence, out of which he had to eat.\r \r They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\r began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are\r you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’\r answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’\r \r The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\r began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\r henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\r did spill a little of anything.\r \r \r \r \r THE LITTLE PEASANT\r \r \r There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\r peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He\r had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\r yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\r ‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\r make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\r other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman\r also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\r the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\r hanging down as if it were eating.\r \r Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\r called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,\r but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All\r right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\r it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\r which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,\r just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the\r herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat\r your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you\r home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and\r waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\r the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\r cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not\r stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must\r have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together,\r but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It\r must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me\r that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness\r condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\r \r And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\r so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\r it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They\r salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\r the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On\r the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,\r and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the\r weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could\r go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The\r miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay\r yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.\r The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman\r thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the\r parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is\r out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard\r them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make\r shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four\r different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\r \r Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\r outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly\r hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\r the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\r on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank\r heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the\r world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the\r straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the\r wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\r shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\r the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get\r me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and\r cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as\r I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and\r said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to\r be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin\r in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you\r there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can\r he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered\r the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\r himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something\r for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked\r and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The\r peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine\r hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there\r and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven\r croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some\r roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and\r went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\r prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some\r salad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and\r went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven\r once more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there\r are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the\r miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\r \r And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife\r was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\r her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little\r peasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth\r is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much\r the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on\r three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s\r head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The\r peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in\r the closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and\r opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,\r and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he\r could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my\r own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with\r the three hundred talers.\r \r At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\r house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to\r the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\r shovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\r bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s\r skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard\r that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed\r all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in\r the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my\r servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he\r did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others\r came, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all\r these skins?’\r \r Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\r outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\r treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\r sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\r pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who\r was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to\r a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the\r man who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free\r from the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up\r came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had\r long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I\r will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The\r shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about?\r What is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make\r me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’\r The shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be\r mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you\r will get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in,\r and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s\r flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,\r and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the\r barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd\r cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than\r that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is\r what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below\r there,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\r \r After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\r village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\r sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,\r and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the\r water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,\r until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\r barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\r of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\r me.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,\r ‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that\r they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\r mayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just\r then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\r are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\r the peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor\r pressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and\r if things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went\r the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\r plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and\r the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\r \r \r \r \r FREDERICK AND CATHERINE\r \r \r There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\r Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\r ‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\r hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’\r ‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew\r nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\r put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to\r crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\r then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\r to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a\r large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran\r into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her\r head, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\r that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\r the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\r it.\r \r Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\r faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what\r can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;\r and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\r to cool herself.\r \r Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\r the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\r the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\r happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from\r seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last\r remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\r and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\r nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have\r now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set\r it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\r all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!\r well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she\r strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her\r cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’\r \r At noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for\r dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but\r while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\r I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\r with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the\r cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,\r ‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the\r ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I\r did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’\r \r The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must\r look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\r said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put\r them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you\r never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that\r I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with\r earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.\r ‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if\r you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow\r buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden\r and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare\r not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these\r yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of\r plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:\r and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been\r doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow\r buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves\r and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of\r work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you\r to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any\r harm in it; you should have told me.’\r \r Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\r ‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\r the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter\r and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’\r ‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\r fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought\r she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’\r \r Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\r was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees\r on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have\r bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she\r took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so\r that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this\r kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down\r the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she\r said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he\r has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after\r it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said\r she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she\r could not stay there all day waiting for them.\r \r At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\r eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’\r said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor\r trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I\r sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on\r the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly\r things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure\r you never told me not.’\r \r They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you\r locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did\r not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’\r said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’\r \r Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\r ‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of\r butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,\r for I have often seen him take some.’\r \r When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\r took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but\r surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took\r her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried\r out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as\r carefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I\r have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so\r that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have\r brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’\r ‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the\r nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if\r you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’\r \r Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\r into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\r when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\r Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\r were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\r class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;\r so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\r Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\r some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on\r the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for\r the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’\r \r Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\r but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\r softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not\r now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,\r then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled\r the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,\r it is hailing.’\r \r A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\r so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray\r don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said\r she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\r said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’\r \r At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that\r was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw\r the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he\r was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down\r went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried\r out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they\r could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,\r there they found all their money safe and sound.\r \r \r \r \r SWEETHEART ROLAND\r \r \r There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\r daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\r her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\r because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\r apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\r told her mother that she must and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my\r child,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepsister has\r long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her\r head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and\r push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor\r girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard\r everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime\r had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\r far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\r front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In\r the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right\r hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,\r and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s\r head off.\r \r When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\r was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said\r to him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\r wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,\r and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland,\r ‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape\r if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the\r dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in\r front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she\r hurried away with her lover.\r \r When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\r wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\r cried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered\r the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\r stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am\r warming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\r kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah,\r here in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She went\r into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\r whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into\r a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\r into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\r sweetheart Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you\r have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her\r many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step,\r and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when\r she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic\r wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\r swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\r threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\r but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\r go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\r Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole\r night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful\r flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\r Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up\r towards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that\r beautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to\r you while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was\r just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower\r was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced\r to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more\r violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes\r from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he\r did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\r \r As they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and\r arrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and\r wait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will\r change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the\r girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.\r But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\r fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\r long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\r changed herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come\r this way, and trample me down.’\r \r It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\r the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\r laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\r in the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\r already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the\r fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,\r when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He\r could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being\r in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was\r certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so\r afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise\r woman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some\r morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no\r matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will\r be stopped.’\r \r The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\r he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he\r sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\r transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\r who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\r time she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\r and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\r answered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\r Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to\r go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\r \r And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,\r and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\r that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\r bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\r that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\r but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,\r she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she\r could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s\r ears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true\r bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had\r vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then\r the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and\r grief came to an end and joy began.\r \r \r \r \r SNOWDROP\r \r \r It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\r around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working\r at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and\r as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three\r drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red\r drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little\r daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as\r black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow\r up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and\r her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\r \r But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\r queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear\r to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy\r looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\r herself in it, and say:\r \r  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r   Of all the ladies in the land,\r   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r \r And the glass had always answered:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’\r \r But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\r old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.\r Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it\r as usual:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\r   But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’\r \r When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\r one of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\r that I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but\r his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\r said, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by\r herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would\r tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his\r heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to\r her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\r \r Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\r the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the\r evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for\r her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and\r neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there\r were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses\r with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by\r the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked\r a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each\r glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she\r tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too\r short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself\r down and went to sleep.\r \r By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little\r dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.\r They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not\r right. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second,\r ‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my\r bread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth,\r ‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with\r my knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first\r looked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came\r running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his\r bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come\r and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought\r their lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child\r she is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake\r her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs\r in turn, till the night was gone.\r \r In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\r and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\r knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\r take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,\r seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\r home; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where\r you are, so take care and let no one in.’\r \r But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\r must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\r said:\r \r  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r   Of all the ladies in the land,\r   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r \r And the glass answered:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r   But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r   Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r   There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r   Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’\r \r Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\r always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.\r And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\r than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went\r her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she\r knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked\r out at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman! what have you to\r sell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all\r colours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good\r sort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.\r ‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced! Let me\r lace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of\r any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work\r so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was\r stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. ‘There’s an end to all\r thy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\r \r In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\r grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the\r ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when\r they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she\r began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The\r old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one\r in when we are away.’\r \r When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\r as before; but to her great grief it still said:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r   But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r   Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r   There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r   Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’\r \r Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\r Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\r another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\r comb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and\r cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone\r in.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave\r her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and\r put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,\r the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. ‘There you may\r lie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs\r came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on\r the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned\r comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that\r had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to\r anyone.\r \r Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\r read the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die,\r if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\r ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\r whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a\r peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage,\r and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and\r said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do\r as you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty\r apple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’\r ‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? Do you\r think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the\r other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the\r other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for\r the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she\r could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,\r when she fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save\r thee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it\r said:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’\r \r And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\r be.\r \r When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\r lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid\r that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and\r washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little\r girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven\r watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they\r would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just\r as it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in\r the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might\r still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name\r was, and that she was a king’s daughter. And the coffin was set among\r the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the\r birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came\r an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\r \r And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\r though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\r as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the\r dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\r letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them\r to let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for\r all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and\r gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home\r with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop\r awoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe\r with me.’\r \r Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better\r than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall\r be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;\r and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their\r wedding.\r \r To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen;\r and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\r glass and said:\r \r  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r   Of all the ladies in the land,\r   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r \r And the glass answered:\r \r  ‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\r   But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’\r \r When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\r were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And\r when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\r she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell\r down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily\r over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the\r mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind\r to Snowdrop in her time of need.\r \r \r \r \r THE PINK\r \r \r There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\r Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\r bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\r and said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,\r so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.’ Then\r she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time\r was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\r \r Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\r beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\r happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\r her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the\r child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,\r and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen’s apron\r and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,\r where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and\r accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by\r the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed\r this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,\r in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into\r it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat\r or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the\r shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her\r food until the seven years were over.\r \r The cook, however, thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power of\r wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So\r he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\r speak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\r a garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words out\r of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.\r After a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for you to be so\r alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son\r wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\r beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\r together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\r went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,\r that the king’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus\r bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,\r and said: ‘Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this\r knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do\r not do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon he went away, and when\r he returned next day she had not done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed\r the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?’ The cook once\r more said: ‘If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When\r he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her\r to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,\r and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: ‘Lie down in\r your bed, and draw the clothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in\r and said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the\r plate to him, but the king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old\r sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.\r You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,\r and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\r throat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\r into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\r were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\r flames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a\r short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\r were still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ‘I will go home to my\r own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’\r she replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land\r where I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as they\r could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed\r into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his\r own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower\r in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for\r a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and\r looked inside, and cried: ‘Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still\r alive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still\r satisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there. Said he: ‘I am your\r dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;\r but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.’ Then he descended\r again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a\r strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said\r yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to\r him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\r district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game\r for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all\r the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.\r And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end\r where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more\r came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.\r Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\r king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having\r had none at all for years.\r \r Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\r household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\r they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ‘As you are\r so clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your majesty\r must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,\r and said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was sitting\r there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\r king’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how\r it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,\r or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,\r and said: ‘Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen\r living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?’ But the king\r replied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will\r not have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and said: ‘Gracious lord\r father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away\r by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\r arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\r chicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:\r ‘That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and these the\r dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\r forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would\r like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form\r of the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron,\r and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,\r and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman\r spoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me\r up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,\r though her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would\r like to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her\r to you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into\r his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\r and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\r Then the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and\r wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\r beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\r \r And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\r to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\r led in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful God who has\r supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three days\r more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white\r doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of\r heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged\r king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the\r king’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden\r whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they\r are still alive or not, is known to God.\r \r \r \r \r CLEVER ELSIE\r \r \r There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And\r when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’\r said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At\r length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;\r but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said\r the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,\r she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’\r ‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When\r they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go\r into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher\r from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she\r went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she\r fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had\r no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected\r injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and\r while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but\r looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\r pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left\r there.\r \r Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have\r a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\r beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she\r sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\r misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,\r but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:\r ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and\r found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why\r do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to\r weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to\r draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill\r him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down\r beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,\r as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the\r beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see\r where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever\r Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you\r weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,\r and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the\r pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What\r a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to\r howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not\r return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see\r where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst\r of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told\r her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\r grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the\r mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept\r with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not\r come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the\r cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,\r and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and\r that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one\r into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if\r he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very\r time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat\r down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone\r for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be\r waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’\r When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\r quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened\r then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other\r and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw\r something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might\r dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to\r weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed\r for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and\r seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\r \r After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work\r and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we\r may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had\r gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\r with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I\r do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then\r she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once\r more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?\r I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.\r Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said\r he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\r even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,\r Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she\r was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought\r a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she\r still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\r down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever\r Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about\r her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was\r alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or\r not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer\r to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:\r ‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure\r to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then\r she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’\r answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:\r ‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the\r people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\r could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has\r seen her since.\r \r \r \r \r THE MISER IN THE BUSH\r \r \r A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\r him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\r into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;\r so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long\r time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my\r trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very\r simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s\r service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to\r have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad\r fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself\r merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming\r over hill and valley.\r \r As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\r met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make\r me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\r should I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it\r all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.\r ‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them\r to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and\r gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have\r such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every\r penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at\r his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I\r will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,\r a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and\r thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf\r said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,\r and went his way.\r \r Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,\r he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old\r miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush\r singing away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I\r would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’\r said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his\r bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.\r The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into\r the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the\r miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in\r the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung\r in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\r the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!\r master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’\r ‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou\r art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the\r miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but\r he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced\r him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till\r at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,\r and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman\r saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took\r the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\r bargain.\r \r Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\r plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\r his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\r complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\r into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\r back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\r officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\r was soon caught and brought up to be tried.\r \r The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of\r his money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the\r countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\r matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\r \r So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord\r Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the\r other. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon\r my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for\r heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge\r said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he\r could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.\r \r Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But\r the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\r note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and\r no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his\r prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first\r bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and\r all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry\r and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed\r to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him\r to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,\r till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him\r the hundred florins.\r \r Then he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where\r you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole\r it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge\r that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman\r stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\r \r \r \r \r ASHPUTTEL\r \r \r The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\r nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be\r a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon\r afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;\r and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always\r good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful\r white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the\r sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This\r new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;\r they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time\r for the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the\r parlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;\r away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and\r gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her\r into the kitchen.\r \r There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\r bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,\r the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the\r evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made\r to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her\r always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\r \r It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\r wife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the\r first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he\r to his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear\r father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\r homewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes\r and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he\r rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost\r pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he\r got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to\r her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was\r watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three\r times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came\r and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over\r her, and brought her whatever she wished for.\r \r Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\r last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\r a bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they\r called her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie\r our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’\r Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help\r crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have\r gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard\r to let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to\r wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to\r the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of\r her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in\r two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast\r too.’\r \r Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\r out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\r \r  ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,\r   Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\r   Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r   Hither, hither, haste away!\r   One and all come help me, quick!\r   Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’\r \r Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\r came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\r heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\r And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\r pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\r them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish\r but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite\r done, and all flew out again at the windows.\r \r Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\r that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you\r slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when\r Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s\r time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go\r too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she\r shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\r \r But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\r and cried out as before:\r \r  ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,\r   Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\r   Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r   Hither, hither, haste away!\r   One and all come help me, quick!\r   Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’\r \r Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\r turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\r chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the\r little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\r then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\r into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all\r was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\r her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.\r But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no\r clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off\r she went with her two daughters to the ball.\r \r Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\r sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\r \r  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r   Gold and silver over me!’\r \r Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\r silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\r on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\r and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\r beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,\r taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\r \r The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\r with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\r else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’\r \r Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\r go home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to\r your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\r she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\r the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\r the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\r the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\r pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\r within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\r she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\r lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could\r through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken\r off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird\r might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her\r little grey frock.\r \r The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\r sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\r \r  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r   Gold and silver over me!’\r \r And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she\r had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\r wondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,\r took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to\r dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’\r \r When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here\r as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang\r away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.\r In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and\r Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without\r being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find\r out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said\r to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I\r think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to\r himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut\r down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into\r the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped\r down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes\r back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey\r frock.\r \r The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\r went again into the garden, and said:\r \r  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r   Gold and silver over me!’\r \r Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\r former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\r to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the\r king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to\r dance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’\r \r When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with\r her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,\r she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\r her left golden slipper upon the stairs.\r \r The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\r and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\r fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they\r had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden\r slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and\r wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could\r not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then\r the mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you\r are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So\r the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,\r and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her\r beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\r \r But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\r had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\r \r  ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\r   The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\r   Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\r   For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’\r \r Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\r blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\r turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\r and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put\r on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the\r shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it\r in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her\r as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\r \r But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\r and sang:\r \r  ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\r   The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\r   Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\r   For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’\r \r Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\r shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\r and brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he\r to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is\r only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\r sure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the\r mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show\r herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed\r her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached\r her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,\r and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made\r for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and\r said, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters\r were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his\r horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the\r white dove sang:\r \r  ‘Home! home! look at the shoe!\r   Princess! the shoe was made for you!\r   Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\r   For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’\r \r And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\r her right shoulder, and so went home with her.\r \r \r \r \r THE WHITE SNAKE\r \r \r A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\r all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of\r the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\r strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,\r and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more\r dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what\r was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\r cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\r \r This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\r away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\r carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,\r he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But\r when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\r so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it\r touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\r outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\r the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of\r all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating\r the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\r \r Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\r beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\r servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to\r be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\r could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked\r upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was\r dismissed with no better answer.\r \r In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\r how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\r together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they\r were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\r confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\r They were telling one another of all the places where they had been\r waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and\r one said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\r I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s\r window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the\r kitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’\r ‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared\r no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long\r enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the\r spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.\r \r The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\r amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him\r the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\r everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\r he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request\r was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he\r saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though\r it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must\r perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his\r horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with\r delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you\r and repay you for saving us!’\r \r He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\r the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why\r cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\r horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\r mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to\r him: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’\r \r The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\r by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with you, you\r idle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for\r you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’\r But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and\r crying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,\r and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the\r good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave\r it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their\r hunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves\r another!’\r \r And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long\r way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in\r the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s\r daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard\r task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had\r already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\r saw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\r forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\r \r So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\r his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\r bottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will\r be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the\r people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him\r alone by the sea.\r \r He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\r he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\r fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in\r its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he\r had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.\r Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him\r the promised reward.\r \r But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\r birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\r task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\r sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning\r before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\r wanting.’\r \r The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\r to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\r sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.\r But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\r all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single\r grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands\r and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry\r picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\r \r Presently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\r amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.\r But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he\r has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had\r brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where\r the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,\r as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding\r it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to\r a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in\r the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time\r three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and\r said: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when\r we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,\r we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life\r stands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out\r homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter,\r who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in\r two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,\r and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\r \r \r \r \r THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS\r \r \r There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\r loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\r wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all\r seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\r be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\r all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but\r you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The\r kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go\r away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way\r with an easy mind.\r \r It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\r ‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\r something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that\r it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried\r they, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but\r your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a\r shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made\r his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the\r house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here\r and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf\r had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them\r and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\r like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I\r have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker\r had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some\r white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The\r wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you\r will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made\r his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.\r \r So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\r it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother\r has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the\r forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that\r we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws\r in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they\r believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should\r come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.\r One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the\r stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the\r sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But\r the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the\r other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in\r the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had\r satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a\r tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards\r the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw\r there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches\r were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts\r and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they\r were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but\r no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice\r cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and\r it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then\r you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\r \r At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.\r When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored\r so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and\r saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,\r heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has\r swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to\r run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\r open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one\r little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six\r sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered\r no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them\r down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,\r and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now\r go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s\r stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged\r the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this\r stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the\r greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once\r stirred.\r \r When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\r and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\r go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the\r stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried\r he:\r \r  ‘What rumbles and tumbles\r   Against my poor bones?\r   I thought ‘twas six kids,\r   But it feels like big stones.’\r \r And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\r heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven\r kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf\r is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with\r their mother.\r \r \r \r \r THE QUEEN BEE\r \r \r Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\r fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\r that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\r little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when\r he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\r young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\r were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set\r out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two\r elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor\r ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the\r little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not\r suffer you to trouble them.’\r \r So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\r about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the\r dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill\r them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was\r so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to\r light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.\r But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy\r themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’\r \r At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\r stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\r no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they\r came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\r was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw\r a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\r twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then\r he rose and came out to them.\r \r He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\r table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and\r drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\r \r The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\r where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\r which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the\r wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s\r daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\r he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’\r \r The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\r but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was\r turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\r \r The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\r better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\r pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\r \r At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\r was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat\r down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants\r (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\r it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\r heap.\r \r The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be\r fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\r he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\r dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\r \r The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and\r the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and\r all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of\r sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;\r so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\r \r Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\r from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\r upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\r which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\r turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf\r married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\r her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.\r \r \r \r \r THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\r \r \r There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\r but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\r had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of\r shoes.\r \r Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning\r to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and\r his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,\r left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after\r he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his\r great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The\r good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.\r He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the\r whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\r \r The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\r he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\r shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.\r In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might\r get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for\r when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon\r in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought\r leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight\r and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some\r time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and\r the good man soon became thriving and well off again.\r \r One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\r the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and\r watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\r me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\r themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\r there, and watched what would happen.\r \r As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\r they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work\r that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching\r and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\r wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the\r job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.\r This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\r lightning.\r \r The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have\r made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\r turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\r indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to\r keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,\r and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and\r do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’\r \r The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\r all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\r work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\r watch what the little elves would do.\r \r About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\r room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\r saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\r mightily delighted.\r \r Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\r capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\r out at the door, and away over the green.\r \r The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\r from that time forward, as long as they lived.\r \r \r \r \r THE JUNIPER-TREE\r \r \r Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich\r man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but\r sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire\r to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they\r remained childless.\r \r In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.\r One winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and\r as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the\r snow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as\r blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew\r light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and\r she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,\r and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all\r the earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the\r trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly\r intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife\r stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her\r heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that\r she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and\r she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the\r berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little\r while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I\r die, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy\r again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and\r when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy\r was so great that she died.\r \r Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\r her. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he\r still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later\r on he married again.\r \r He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\r was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother\r loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked\r at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in\r the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could\r get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession\r of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She\r drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the\r poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left\r school to the time he went back.\r \r One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the\r store-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said\r the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\r had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.\r \r ‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one\r too?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he\r comes out of school.’\r \r Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\r as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out\r of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before\r your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The\r little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say\r kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a\r wicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give\r me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come\r with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one\r out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged\r her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.\r Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.\r ‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So\r she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of\r her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and\r bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed\r him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.\r \r Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\r a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is\r sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\r and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\r frightened me.’\r \r ‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him\r a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me\r that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the\r ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran\r crying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off\r brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\r \r ‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,\r so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make\r him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him\r into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,\r and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no\r need of salt.\r \r Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\r ‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\r black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\r \r The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’\r \r ‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s\r great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’\r \r ‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’\r \r ‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\r weeks; he is well looked after there.’\r \r ‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not\r be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’\r \r With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do\r you weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more\r pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\r \r Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\r her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\r table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but\r weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and\r she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,\r and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the\r branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and\r then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for\r joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there\r was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful\r bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it\r could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the\r silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.\r \r Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\r still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to\r the table and ate.\r \r The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\r sing:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\r song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got\r up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\r slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on\r one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still\r held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing\r up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\r \r ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’\r \r ‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\r chain, and I will sing it you again.’\r \r ‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that\r again.’\r \r The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then\r he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and\r sang:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\r shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his\r hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\r \r ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the\r door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it\r and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the\r children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\r street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red\r and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two\r bright stars in its head.\r \r ‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’\r \r ‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must\r give me something.’\r \r ‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will\r see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched\r the shoes.\r \r ‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’\r \r The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\r went back to the roof and sang:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw\r and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the\r mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were\r twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,\r hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click\r clack.’\r \r The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r \r then one of the men left off,\r \r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r \r two more men left off and listened,\r \r   My sister loved me best of all;\r \r then four more left off,\r \r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r \r now there were only eight at work,\r \r   Underneath\r \r And now only five,\r \r   the juniper-tree.\r \r And now only one,\r \r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r then he looked up and the last one had left off work.\r \r ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it\r too; sing it again.’\r \r ‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\r millstone, and I will sing it again.’\r \r ‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’\r \r ‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’\r \r The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\r stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\r the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the\r tree and sang--\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the\r chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round\r his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.\r \r The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\r \r ‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’\r \r ‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\r were coming.’\r \r But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\r \r Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\r \r ‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun\r shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’\r \r ‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that\r my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and\r she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the\r corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\r \r The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r \r the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\r nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a\r violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\r \r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r \r ‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so\r magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\r scent of spice in the air!’\r \r   My sister loved me best of all;\r \r then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\r \r ‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.\r \r ‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in\r flames!’\r \r But the man went out and looked at the bird.\r \r  She laid her kerchief over me,\r  And took my bones that they might lie\r  Underneath the juniper-tree\r  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\r man’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\r \r He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has\r given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’\r \r But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,\r and her cap fell from her head.\r \r Then the bird began again:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r \r ‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the\r earth, that I might not hear that song.’\r \r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r \r then the woman fell down again as if dead.\r \r   My sister loved me best of all;\r \r ‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will\r give me anything.’\r \r So she went out.\r \r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r \r and he threw down the shoes to her,\r \r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\r danced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I\r came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\r and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’\r \r The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\r of fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten\r my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’\r \r But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone\r down on her head, and she was crushed to death.\r \r The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\r saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\r passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\r little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\r inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\r \r \r \r \r THE TURNIP\r \r \r There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\r the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\r pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\r and sowed turnips.\r \r When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\r it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\r growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for\r there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it\r was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and\r the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it\r would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What\r shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;\r and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing\r perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’\r \r Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\r to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many\r strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you\r get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child\r of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune;\r I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I\r laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a\r brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world\r knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’\r \r The king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no\r longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your\r brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so\r rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\r \r When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\r gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\r could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he\r determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a\r rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must\r have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so\r much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?\r \r The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\r give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\r the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.\r When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;\r and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to\r kill his brother.\r \r So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\r lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have\r found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\r us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\r together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out\r upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\r \r But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\r horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\r prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\r cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime\r he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out\r his head.\r \r When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\r who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as\r the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good\r morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about\r everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came\r from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’\r \r Then the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here\r I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great\r and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the\r schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man\r can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here\r I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws\r that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the\r healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of\r precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel\r and own the power of knowledge.\r \r The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\r ‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\r let me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if\r very unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou\r wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an\r hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown\r to me.’\r \r So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\r heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\r for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give\r way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\r yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down,\r opened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend\r quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a\r while,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him\r in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after\r wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he,\r ‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,\r till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’\r \r So saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow\r to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.\r \r \r \r \r CLEVER HANS\r \r \r The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To\r Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’\r ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,\r Hans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have\r something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:\r ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\r \r Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart\r home. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’\r ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something\r given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the\r needle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You\r should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do\r better next time.’\r \r ‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\r I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\r Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is\r good?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel\r presents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans\r takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,\r mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What\r did you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did\r Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck\r in my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in\r your pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\r \r ‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\r I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\r Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you\r bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents\r Hans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes\r the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it\r is suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have\r you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she\r gave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’\r ‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,\r Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,\r will do better next time.’\r \r ‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\r I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\r Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you\r bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents\r Hans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\r \r Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.\r The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope\r in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good\r evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With\r Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me\r something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where\r is the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took\r it.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your\r head.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\r \r ‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll\r behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.\r ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I\r bring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans\r with a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\r \r Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.\r ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With\r Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something\r given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the\r calf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was\r ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’\r ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\r \r ‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll\r behave well.

apples were always counted, and about\r the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\r of them was gone.", "The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\r gardener to keep watch all night under the tree.", "The gardener set his\r eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in\r the morning another of the apples was missing.", "Then the second son was\r ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\r another apple was gone.", "Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\r the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\r to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\r under the tree to watch.", "As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\r noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\r it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son\r jumped up and shot an arrow at it.", "But the arrow did the bird no harm;\r only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.", "The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\r council was called together.", "Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\r all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no\r use to me, I must have the whole bird.’\r \r Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\r bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\r wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\r bow and made ready to shoot at it.", "Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,\r for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and\r that you want to find the golden bird.", "You will reach a village in the\r evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\r other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\r there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\r to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can\r such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at\r the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\r ran into the wood.", "Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\r the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\r singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\r and poor.", "‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby\r house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,\r and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.", "Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\r were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\r to him.", "He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\r to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\r the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\r withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\r his country in the same manner.", "Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\r the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\r listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\r was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\r coming back.", "However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\r not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\r the same good counsel.", "But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\r attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my\r tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to\r run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\r whistled in the wind.", "When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and\r without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\r night at his ease.", "In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\r was beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come\r to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\r snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\r on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\r close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\r bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\r you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\r young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\r their hair whistled in the wind.", "Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\r and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\r below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\r lost were lying close by it.", "Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a\r very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so\r he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.", "But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\r they took him prisoner and carried him before the king.", "The next morning\r the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\r die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\r swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\r given him for his own.", "So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\r when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now\r what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel.", "I will\r still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\r I bid you.", "You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the\r horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep\r and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old\r leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’\r Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock\r and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.", "All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\r saddle.", "But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity\r to put the leathern saddle upon it.", "‘I will give him the good one,’\r said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the\r groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took\r him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court\r to be judged, and was sentenced to die.", "But it was agreed, that, if he\r could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the\r bird and the horse given him for his own.", "Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why\r did not you listen to me?", "If you had, you would have carried away\r both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel.", "Go\r straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle.", "At twelve\r o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\r and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\r you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’\r Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\r and stone till their hair whistled again.", "As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\r o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the\r kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears\r that he would let her take leave of her father.", "At first he refused,\r but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last\r he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards\r awoke and he was taken prisoner again.", "Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never\r have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops\r the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world\r could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had\r done very little, the fox came and said.", "‘Lie down and go to sleep; I\r will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;\r so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was\r removed he must give him the princess.", "Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man\r and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all\r three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man,\r ‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’\r \r ‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done.", "When you come\r to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here\r she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden\r horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of\r them; but shake hands with the princess last.", "Then lift her quickly on\r to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as\r fast as you can.’\r \r All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where\r the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\r ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\r horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that\r you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and\r when you get it into your hand, ride away.’\r \r This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\r princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood.", "Then the fox\r came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the\r young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give\r you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\r and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went.", "‘Well,’\r thought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’\r \r He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\r he had left his two brothers.", "And there he heard a great noise and\r uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men\r are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\r his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any\r way be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his\r money upon the rascals and buy their liberty.", "Then he did not stay to\r think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\r given up, and went on with him towards their home.", "And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\r cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the\r side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,\r ‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\r river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\r down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\r home to the king their master, and said.", "‘All this have we won by our\r labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\r eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.", "The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was\r nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\r that he could find no way to get out.", "Then the old fox came once more,\r and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\r have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\r of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\r to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill\r you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor\r man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the\r doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\r left off weeping.", "Then he went to the king, and told him all his\r brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\r princess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to\r his kingdom.", "A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\r met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\r off his head and feet.", "And at last he did so, and in a moment the\r fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\r princess, who had been lost a great many many years.", "HANS IN LUCK\r \r \r Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\r right--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\r swans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\r will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\r much the faster.", "The world may very likely not always think of them as\r they think of themselves, but what care they for the world?", "what can it\r know about the matter?", "One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans.", "Seven long years he had\r worked hard for his master.", "At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I\r must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\r and let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good\r servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump\r of silver as big as his head.", "Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\r threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards.", "As he\r went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\r trotting gaily along on a capital horse.", "‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a\r fine thing it is to ride on horseback!", "There he sits as easy and happy\r as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\r stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did\r not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,\r friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to\r carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up\r my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say\r of making an exchange?’ said the horseman.", "‘I will give you my horse,\r and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\r trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my\r heart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\r thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’\r However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\r the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When\r you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\r “Jip!”’\r \r Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\r elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\r minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\r \r  ‘No care and no sorrow,\r   A fig for the morrow!", "We’ll laugh and be merry,\r   Sing neigh down derry!’\r \r After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\r smacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and\r before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\r back by the road-side.", "His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\r was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it.", "Hans soon came to\r himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\r shepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\r a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\r his neck.", "However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\r deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\r spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\r not very like a nosegay.", "One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that\r cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\r into the bargain.", "What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said\r the shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\r horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\r myself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily.", "‘What a noble heart that good man\r has!’ thought he.", "Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\r and the cow good morning, and away he rode.", "Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\r then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\r one.", "‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\r able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\r it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\r can I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\r bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer.", "When he had\r rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s\r village.", "But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\r last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\r an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\r clave to the roof of his mouth.", "‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought\r he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the\r stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\r was to be had.", "Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\r him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry?", "Hans had\r not thought of looking to that.", "While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\r clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\r last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\r lay a long while senseless.", "Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\r pig in a wheelbarrow.", "‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the\r butcher, as he helped him up.", "Hans told him what had happened, how he\r was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too.", "Then\r the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh\r yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old\r beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said\r Hans, ‘who would have thought it?", "What a shame to take my horse, and\r give me only a dry cow!", "If I kill her, what will she be good for?", "I hate\r cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me.", "If it were a pig now--like\r that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\r something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said\r the butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\r neighbourly thing.", "To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\r pig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’\r said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\r wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\r its leg.", "So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\r with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.", "How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\r last got?", "The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose.", "The\r countryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;\r and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\r how all the world went gay and smiling with him.", "The countryman then\r began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\r christening.", "‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\r weeks old.", "Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\r it has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in\r his hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the\r countryman began to look grave, and shook his head.", "‘Hark ye!’ said he,\r ‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing\r you a kind turn.", "Your pig may get you into a scrape.", "In the village I\r just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty.", "I was\r dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig.", "If\r you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you.", "The least\r they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond.", "Can you swim?’\r \r Poor Hans was sadly frightened.", "‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out\r of this scrape.", "I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\r but he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this\r country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought\r to have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat\r goose for a pig, indeed!", "‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\r that.", "However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then\r he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\r while Hans went on the way homewards free from care.", "‘After all,’\r thought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in.", "I don’t care whose pig\r it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me.", "I\r have much the best of the bargain.", "First there will be a capital roast;\r then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\r are all the beautiful white feathers.", "I will put them into my pillow,\r and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking.", "How happy my\r mother will be!", "Talk of a pig, indeed!", "Give me a fine fat goose.’\r \r As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\r working and singing,\r \r  ‘O’er hill and o’er dale\r   So happy I roam,\r   Work light and live well,\r   All the world is my home;\r   Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’\r \r Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well\r off, master grinder!", "you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the\r other, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\r into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\r beautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where\r did you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a\r horse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my\r head for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh!", "I worked hard for that seven long\r years.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder,\r ‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\r in it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be\r managed?’ ‘How?", "Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other;\r ‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself.", "Here is one\r that is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\r value of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said\r Hans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\r whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more?", "there’s\r the goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\r that lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\r enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’\r \r Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\r sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born\r in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.", "People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\r letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’\r \r Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\r last penny in his joy at getting the cow.", "At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\r dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\r water, and rest a while.", "So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\r the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\r little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.", "For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\r up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\r with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\r the ugly heavy stone.", "‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he\r got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\r he reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to\r good luck was.", "JORINDA AND JORINDEL\r \r \r There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\r wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy.", "Now this fairy could take\r any shape she pleased.", "All the day long she flew about in the form of\r an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\r became an old woman again.", "When any young man came within a hundred\r paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step\r till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given\r her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came\r within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her\r into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle.", "There were\r seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with\r beautiful birds in them.", "Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda.", "She was prettier\r than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\r lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\r to be married.", "One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\r alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near\r to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\r setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\r the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\r birches.", "Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\r both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\r parted from one another for ever.", "They had wandered a long way; and when\r they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\r at a loss to know what path to take.", "The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\r the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\r bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\r walls of the castle.", "Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.", "Jorinda was just singing,\r \r  ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\r   Well-a-day!", "Well-a-day!", "He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,\r   Well-a-day!’\r \r when her song stopped suddenly.", "Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\r beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\r with a mournful _jug, jug_.", "An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\r round them, and three times screamed:\r \r  ‘Tu whu!", "Tu whu!", "Tu whu!’\r \r Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\r weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot.", "And now the sun went quite down;\r the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\r old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\r chin that almost met one another.", "She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\r with it in her hand.", "Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\r what could he do?", "He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\r where he stood.", "At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\r voice:\r \r  ‘Till the prisoner is fast,\r   And her doom is cast,\r   There stay!", "Oh, stay!", "When the charm is around her,\r   And the spell has bound her,\r   Hie away!", "away!’\r \r On a sudden Jorindel found himself free.", "Then he fell on his knees\r before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\r she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\r went her way.", "He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain.", "‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what\r will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\r a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep.", "Many a time\r did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\r but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.", "At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\r and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\r plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\r that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\r found his Jorinda again.", "In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\r this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\r on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\r flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\r pearl.", "Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\r night, till he came again to the castle.", "He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\r fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.", "Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this.", "Then he touched the door with\r the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,\r and listened when he heard so many birds singing.", "At last he came to the\r chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in\r the seven hundred cages.", "When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\r screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\r the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard.", "He looked around at\r the birds, but alas!", "there were many, many nightingales, and how then\r should he find out which was his Jorinda?", "While he was thinking what to\r do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the\r best of her way off through the door.", "He ran or flew after her, touched\r the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her\r arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when\r they walked together in the wood.", "Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\r took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\r married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\r other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s\r cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.", "THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS\r \r \r An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\r a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\r unfit for work.", "His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\r began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\r mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\r towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’\r \r After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\r roadside and panting as if he were tired.", "‘What makes you pant so, my\r friend?’ said the ass.", "‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to\r knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\r myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\r earn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great\r city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\r do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\r together.", "They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\r road and making a most rueful face.", "‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,\r ‘what’s the matter with you?", "You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’\r said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in\r danger?", "Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\r ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\r laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\r enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’\r ‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are\r a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat\r was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.", "Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\r perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.", "‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\r is all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that\r we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\r the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\r head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\r on Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master\r Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\r your head cut off!", "Besides, who knows?", "If we care to sing in tune, we\r may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my\r heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.", "They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\r night came on, they went into a wood to sleep.", "The ass and the dog laid\r themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\r branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\r should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\r his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\r see that everything was well.", "In doing this, he saw afar off something\r bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a\r house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said\r the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\r best in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the\r worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together\r towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\r near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\r house in which a gang of robbers lived.", "The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\r peeped in.", "‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What\r do I see?’ replied the ass.", "‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\r good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would\r be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock.", "‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we\r could only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive\r to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan.", "The ass placed\r himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\r window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s\r shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head.", "When\r all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music.", "The ass\r brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\r they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\r the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter!", "The\r robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\r had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\r and scampered away as fast as they could.", "The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\r the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\r to eat again for a month.", "As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\r put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\r his own liking.", "The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\r the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\r cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\r cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\r rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.", "But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\r out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\r too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\r the rest, went to see what was going on.", "Finding everything still, he\r marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\r order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\r the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\r light it.", "But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\r and spat, and scratched at him.", "This frightened him dreadfully, and away\r he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\r leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\r cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might.", "At\r this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\r the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\r him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\r knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\r in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\r club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\r ‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go\r back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\r that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\r this very day.", "OLD SULTAN\r \r \r A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\r and had lost all his teeth.", "And one day when the shepherd and his wife\r were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot\r old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife\r said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a\r great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of\r his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not\r a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to\r be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;\r tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’\r \r Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\r and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\r tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\r friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,\r and how his master meant to kill him in the morning.", "‘Make yourself\r easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice.", "Your master,\r you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\r field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\r behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work.", "Now do you lie\r down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come\r out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as\r you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they\r will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you\r that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this\r plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed.", "The wolf ran with the\r child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\r soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\r and mistress.", "Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old\r Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live\r and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat.", "Wife, go home, and\r give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on\r as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he\r could wish for.", "Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my\r good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\r when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’\r said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf\r thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel.", "But\r Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\r for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for\r a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed\r his locks for him finely.", "Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and\r swore he would have his revenge.", "So the next morning the wolf sent the\r boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter.", "Now\r Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old\r three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped\r along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.", "The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\r espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing\r straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\r fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\r a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\r fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\r up into a tree.", "Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\r wondered that no one was there.", "The boar, however, had not quite hidden\r himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\r them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\r mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\r up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there\r sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf\r sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\r and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\r himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.", "THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\r \r \r In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\r of beans and wanted to cook them.", "So she made a fire on her hearth, and\r that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.", "When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\r observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\r a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two.", "Then the straw\r began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal\r replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\r by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\r burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,\r but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\r into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better\r fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw.", "‘The old woman has\r destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\r once, and took their lives.", "I luckily slipped through her fingers.’\r \r ‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.", "‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped\r death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\r mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\r repair to a foreign country.’\r \r The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\r together.", "Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\r no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\r it.", "The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight\r across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw\r therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\r who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\r newly-built bridge.", "But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\r water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\r and ventured no farther.", "The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\r two pieces, and fell into the stream.", "The coal slipped after her, hissed\r when she got into the water, and breathed her last.", "The bean, who had\r prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\r was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst.", "It would\r have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\r was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.", "As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\r and sewed her together.", "The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\r tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.", "BRIAR ROSE\r \r \r A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\r where there were in those days fairies.", "Now this king and queen had\r plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\r good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but\r though they had been married many years they had no children, and this\r grieved them very much indeed.", "But one day as the queen was walking\r by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\r little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\r and nearly dead on the bank.", "Then the queen took pity on the little\r fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\r it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,\r and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\r soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to\r pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\r could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\r feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land.", "So he asked\r his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours.", "But the queen\r said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good\r to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;\r but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat\r out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.", "So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red\r shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:\r and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all\r their best gifts to the little princess.", "One gave her goodness, another\r beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\r world.", "Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\r the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\r come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\r broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.", "Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\r scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\r revenge.", "So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\r year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of\r the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\r said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\r mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle\r wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\r hundred years.", "However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\r the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\r should be bought up and burnt.", "But all the gifts of the first eleven\r fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\r beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew\r her loved her.", "It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\r and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace.", "So she\r roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till\r at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase\r ending with a little door.", "In the door there was a golden key, and when\r she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning\r away very busily.", "‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what\r are you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her\r head, humming a tune, while buzz!", "went the wheel.", "‘How prettily that\r little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle\r and began to try and spin.", "But scarcely had she touched it, before the\r fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell\r down lifeless on the ground.", "However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\r the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\r fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\r the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\r the walls.", "Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\r sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\r goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\r at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\r on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\r asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the\r jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.", "A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\r became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\r and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen.", "But\r there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\r Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to\r time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\r into the palace.", "This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\r thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\r they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.", "After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an\r old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\r palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\r lay in it asleep, with all her court.", "He told, too, how he had heard\r from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\r break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\r died.", "Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I\r will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but\r he was bent upon going.", "Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\r to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\r which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.", "Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\r asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\r the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings.", "And when he\r came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\r was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\r to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\r plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\r if she was going to beat the boy.", "Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\r every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\r the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\r fast asleep on a couch by the window.", "She looked so beautiful that he\r could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.", "But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\r upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\r awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.", "And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\r pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\r flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\r the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\r with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\r draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave\r the boy the box on his ear.", "And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\r was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.", "THE DOG AND THE SPARROW\r \r \r A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\r suffer the greatest hunger.", "At last he could bear it no longer; so he\r took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.", "On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,\r my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have\r nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me\r into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they\r went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,\r the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you\r down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\r first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\r pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\r till at last down it fell.", "Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\r away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up.", "‘Well,’ said\r the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\r the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had\r eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you\r had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should\r like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’\r said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him\r to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\r they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\r another shop and pecked down some more for him.", "When that was eaten, the\r sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now.", "‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and\r now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went\r out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\r far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a\r nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime\r I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the\r road, and fell fast asleep.", "Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\r a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine.", "The\r sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\r go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\r out, ‘Stop!", "stop!", "Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the\r carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!", "what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\r dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death.", "‘There,’ cried the\r sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog.", "Now\r mind what I say.", "This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’\r ‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’\r and passed on.", "But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\r pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\r all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it.", "At last he looked\r round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.", "‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he.", "‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\r the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\r pecked at him till he reared up and kicked.", "When the carter saw this,\r he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\r her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head\r with such force, that he fell down dead.", "‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’\r cried he.", "‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow.", "And as the carter\r went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the\r cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine\r ran out.", "When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch\r that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and\r perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too.", "The\r carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she\r flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the\r spot.", "‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he.", "‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\r the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him\r too.", "The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or\r caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his\r third horse as he done the other two.", "‘Alas!", "miserable wretch that I\r am!’ cried he.", "‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew\r away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The\r carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\r overflowing with rage and vexation.", "‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what\r ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\r dead.’ ‘Alas!", "husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into\r the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am\r sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it\r up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of\r birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\r midst of them.", "‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw\r that the corn was almost all gone.", "‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the\r sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.", "The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\r into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat\r himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner.", "But the sparrow sat\r on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter!", "thy cruelty shall cost\r thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,\r and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the\r window.", "The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\r cried, ‘Carter!", "it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and\r blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\r cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\r and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\r glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\r touching the bird at all.", "In the end, however, they caught her: and the\r wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting\r her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\r her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\r and cried, ‘Carter!", "it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he\r could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,\r strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but\r she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\r dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.", "THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\r \r \r There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters.", "They slept in\r twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\r shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\r worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\r could find out how it happened, or where they had been.", "Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\r discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\r danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\r wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\r succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.", "A king’s son soon came.", "He was well entertained, and in the evening was\r taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\r twelve beds.", "There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;\r and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door\r of his chamber was left open.", "But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and\r when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\r dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes.", "The same thing\r happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\r cut off.", "After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\r and all lost their lives in the same manner.", "Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\r and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\r reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\r who asked him where he was going.", "‘I hardly know where I am going, or\r what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very\r well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\r I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard\r task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\r princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\r you pretend to be fast asleep.’\r \r Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on\r you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\r princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good\r counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\r he was willing to undertake the task.", "He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\r fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\r to the outer chamber.", "Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\r the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\r away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop.", "Then he laid himself\r down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\r he was fast asleep.", "When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\r heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser\r thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened\r their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\r dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\r to begin dancing.", "But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while\r you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will\r befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;\r have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?", "And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping\r draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’\r \r When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\r snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\r quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,\r and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open.", "The soldier\r saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest\r leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put\r on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;\r but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest\r princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone\r took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is\r nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the\r bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and\r the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.", "The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke\r off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree.", "Then the\r youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you\r hear that noise?", "That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It\r is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’\r \r Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\r gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\r diamonds.", "And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\r was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\r the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.", "So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\r lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\r who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.", "One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\r the same boat with the youngest.", "As they were rowing over the lake, the\r prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\r said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\r we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat\r seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the\r princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’\r \r On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\r which came the merry music of horns and trumpets.", "There they all landed,\r and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\r the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and\r when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it\r all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty.", "At this,\r too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always\r silenced her.", "They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then\r all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.", "The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\r soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the\r opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising\r to come again the next night.", "When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\r and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very\r much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all\r is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine\r clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed.", "In the morning the\r soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more\r of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;\r and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\r till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home.", "However,\r on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a\r token of where he had been.", "As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\r before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the\r twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would\r say.", "And when the king asked him.", "‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at\r night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And\r then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three\r branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him.", "Then the king\r called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said\r was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was\r of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all.", "And the king\r asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he\r answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they\r were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s\r heir.", "THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE\r \r \r There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\r by the seaside.", "The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and\r one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling\r waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away\r deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.", "But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live!", "I am not a real fish; I am an\r enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’\r said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will\r have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon\r as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted\r straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him\r on the wave.", "When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how\r he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\r prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again.", "‘Did not\r you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,\r in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\r little cottage.’\r \r The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\r seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\r green.", "And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!", "Hearken to me!", "My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?", "What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when\r I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let\r you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants\r a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the\r cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the\r door of a nice trim little cottage.", "‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is\r not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a\r parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there\r was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and\r there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens.", "‘Ah!’ said the\r fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at\r least,’ said his wife.", "Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\r ‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\r courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\r have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him\r to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to\r him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this\r pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it\r very willingly, I know; go along and try!’\r \r The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\r the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went\r close to the edge of the waves, and said:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!", "Hearken to me!", "My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish.", "‘Ah!’ said the man,\r dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’\r said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went\r the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\r castle.", "‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into\r the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the\r rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and\r behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a\r mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the\r courtyard were stables and cow-houses.", "‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we\r will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of\r our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,\r before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.", "The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\r she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,\r and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’\r said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king?", "I will not be king.’\r ‘Then I will,’ said she.", "‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you\r be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say\r no more about it, but go and try!", "I will be king.’ So the man went away\r quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king.", "This time\r the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves\r and the ridges of foam as he cried out:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!", "Hearken to me!", "My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish.", "‘Alas!’ said the poor\r man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king\r already.’\r \r Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw\r a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets.", "And when\r he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,\r with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six\r fair maidens, each a head taller than the other.", "‘Well, wife,’ said the\r fisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had\r looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife!", "what a fine thing it\r is to be king!", "Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long\r as we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long\r time.", "I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\r think I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife!", "why should you wish to\r be emperor?’ said the fisherman.", "‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!", "I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish\r cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\r such a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go\r at once!’\r \r So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\r ‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\r tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He\r soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\r a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\r went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!", "Hearken to me!", "My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘What would she have now?’ said the fish.", "‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,\r ‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor\r already.’\r \r So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\r sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\r her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards\r and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the\r tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger.", "And\r before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\r up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am\r emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing\r it is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being\r emperor?", "I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be\r pope?", "there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said\r she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the\r fish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make\r an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’\r \r So the fisherman went.", "But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\r and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were\r in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows.", "In the\r middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards\r the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising.", "At this sight\r the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his\r knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and\r said:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!", "Hearken to me!", "My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘What does she want now?’ said the fish.", "‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my\r wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’\r \r Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\r that was two miles high.", "And she had three great crowns on her head, and\r around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church.", "And on each side\r of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as\r large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no\r larger than a small rushlight.", "‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked\r at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’\r ‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now\r you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about\r that,’ said the wife.", "Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not\r sleep all night for thinking what she should be next.", "At last, as she\r was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose.", "‘Ha!’ thought she,\r as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot\r prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened\r her husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must\r be lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the\r thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.", "‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’\r said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my\r leave.", "Go to the fish at once!’\r \r Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to\r the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\r shook.", "And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\r lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\r the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\r white foam upon their heads.", "And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\r and cried out, as well as he could:\r \r  ‘O man of the sea!", "Hearken to me!", "My wife Ilsabill\r   Will have her own will,\r   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r \r ‘What does she want now?’ said the fish.", "‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to\r be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty\r again.’\r \r And there they live to this very day.", "THE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR\r \r \r Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\r and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother\r wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’\r said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was\r the willow-wren.", "‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very\r much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not\r done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until\r the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in\r her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young\r ones.", "The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him\r back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady\r Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the\r nest lay, and trotted away.", "The bear, however, could not rest until he\r had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it\r again.", "The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw\r five or six young ones lying there.", "‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried\r the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you\r are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were\r frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not!", "Our parents are\r honest people!", "Bear, you will have to pay for that!’\r \r The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\r holes.", "The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\r when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as\r touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\r settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\r here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall\r be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and\r called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children?", "You shall\r suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was\r announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\r part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\r contained.", "And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\r air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\r flies had to come.", "When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies\r to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief.", "The gnat, who was\r the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,\r and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be\r announced.", "There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him\r and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be\r general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we\r agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long\r bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers.", "When I lift\r my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\r let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard\r that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\r detail, to the willow-wren.", "When day broke, and the battle was to begin,\r all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the\r earth trembled.", "The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\r the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\r was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\r other.", "But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle\r beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might.", "When the fox felt\r the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\r he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\r sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\r hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs.", "When\r the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each\r into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.", "Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\r ‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won\r the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear\r must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable\r children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the\r bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my\r children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall\r be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged\r their pardon.", "And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat\r down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the\r night.", "THE FROG-PRINCE\r \r \r One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\r out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\r spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down\r to rest a while.", "Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\r favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\r catching it again as it fell.", "After a time she threw it up so high that\r she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\r along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring.", "The\r princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\r deep that she could not see the bottom of it.", "Then she began to bewail\r her loss, and said, ‘Alas!", "if I could only get my ball again, I would\r give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\r world.’\r \r Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\r ‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you\r do for me, you nasty frog?", "My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’\r The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;\r but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off\r your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball\r again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is\r talking!", "He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\r he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\r shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will\r bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head\r down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\r up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\r spring.", "As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\r it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\r never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.", "The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\r said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.", "The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\r strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\r marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\r door, and a little voice cried out and said:\r \r  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r   Open the door to thy true love here!", "And mind the words that thou and I said\r   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r \r Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\r the frog, whom she had quite forgotten.", "At this sight she was sadly\r frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\r seat.", "The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\r asked her what was the matter.", "‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at\r the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\r told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\r get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\r in.’\r \r While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\r \r  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r   Open the door to thy true love here!", "And mind the words that thou and I said\r   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r \r Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word\r you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped\r into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\r bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\r the princess sat.", "‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,\r ‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog\r said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This\r she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am\r tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,\r though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\r pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long.", "As soon as it was\r light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.", "‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be\r troubled with him no more.’\r \r But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\r tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\r \r  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r   Open the door to thy true love here!", "And mind the words that thou and I said\r   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r \r And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\r her pillow as before, till the morning broke.", "And the third night he did\r the same.", "But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\r astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\r with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\r of her bed.", "He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\r changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\r some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\r her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights.", "‘You,’ said the\r prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\r but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will\r marry you, and love you as long as you live.’\r \r The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to\r all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\r horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\r the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\r the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\r bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.", "They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\r horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s\r kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\r many years.", "CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r \r \r A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\r to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\r length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.", "‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\r from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture\r everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice\r was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\r to put it.", "At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no\r place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\r dares take anything away from there.", "We will set it beneath the altar,\r and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was\r placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\r yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,\r little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\r asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\r him over the font at the christening.", "Let me go out today, and you look\r after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all\r means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me.", "I\r should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,\r however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\r be godmother.", "She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\r began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off.", "Then she took a\r walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\r stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\r of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.", "‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a\r merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat.", "‘What name did they\r give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly.", "‘Top off!’ cried\r the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\r your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse\r than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’\r \r Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning.", "She said to\r the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\r a day alone.", "I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\r white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,\r but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\r half the pot of fat.", "‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\r oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work.", "When\r she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’\r ‘Half-done,’ answered the cat.", "‘Half-done!", "What are you saying?", "I\r never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the\r calendar!’\r \r The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking.", "‘All good\r things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.", "The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\r exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\r happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!", "Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me\r very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey\r fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because\r you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse\r cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\r emptied the pot of fat.", "‘When everything is eaten up one has some\r peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\r home till night.", "The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\r the third child.", "‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the\r cat.", "‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the\r most suspicious name of all!", "I have never seen it in print.", "All-gone;\r what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\r down to sleep.", "From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\r when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\r outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,\r we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\r shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much\r as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\r window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\r fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty.", "‘Alas!’ said the\r mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light!", "You are a true\r friend!", "You have devoured all when you were standing godmother.", "First\r top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the\r cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on\r the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\r on her, seized her, and swallowed her down.", "Verily, that is the way of\r the world.", "THE GOOSE-GIRL\r \r \r The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\r only child.", "This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\r mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her.", "And there was a good\r fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\r over her.", "When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\r great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\r got ready to set off on her journey to his country.", "Then the queen her\r mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\r silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\r royal bride.", "And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\r her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.", "Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,\r and could speak.", "When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\r bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\r and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for\r it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took\r a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\r her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\r bridegroom’s kingdom.", "One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\r feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch\r me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\r drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\r stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\r longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\r little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\r her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas!", "what will become of me?’\r And the lock answered her, and said:\r \r  ‘Alas!", "alas!", "if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\r maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.", "Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\r the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\r and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude\r speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\r my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\r than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’\r Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\r down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\r ‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:\r \r  ‘Alas!", "alas!", "if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\r and floated away with the water.", "Now she was so frightened that she did\r not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\r charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\r she had lost the hair.", "So when the bride had done drinking, and would\r have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,\r and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her\r horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\r maid’s shabby ones.", "At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\r servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\r happened.", "But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.", "Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\r other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\r royal court.", "There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\r meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\r who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;\r but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.", "Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\r amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\r going on; and he saw her in the courtyard.", "As she looked very pretty,\r and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\r to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left\r standing in the court below.", "‘I brought her with me for the sake of her\r company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,\r that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think\r of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes\r care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,\r that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was\r Curdken.", "But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one\r piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince.", "‘Then tell one of\r your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\r was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,\r she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and\r tell all she had done to the princess.", "She carried her point, and the\r faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she\r wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large\r dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning\r and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes.", "Then the\r slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and\r nailed it up under the dark gate.", "Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\r she said sorrowfully:\r \r  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r \r and the head answered:\r \r  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!", "Alas!", "alas!", "if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on.", "And when she\r came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\r waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\r saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the\r locks out, but she cried:\r \r  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!", "Let Curdken’s hat go!", "Blow, breezes, blow!", "Let him after it go!", "O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r   Away be it whirl’d\r   Till the silvery locks\r   Are all comb’d and curl’d!", "Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and\r away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\r it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her\r hair, and had put it up again safe.", "Then he was very angry and sulky,\r and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it\r grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.", "The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\r girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:\r \r  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r \r and the head answered:\r \r  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!", "Alas!", "alas!", "if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\r to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\r take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\r \r  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!", "Let Curdken’s hat go!", "Blow, breezes, blow!", "Let him after it go!", "O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r   Away be it whirl’d\r   Till the silvery locks\r   Are all comb’d and curl’d!", "Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\r over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\r he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe.", "So they\r watched the geese till it grew dark.", "In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\r said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\r longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king.", "‘Because, instead of doing any good, she\r does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him\r what had happened.", "And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through\r the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\r of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\r \r  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r \r and the head answers:\r \r  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!", "Alas!", "alas!", "if thy mother knew it,\r   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r \r And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\r where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\r to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves.", "But the\r old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning\r came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke\r to Falada, and how Falada answered.", "Then he went into the field, and\r hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own\r eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,\r she let down her hair that glittered in the sun.", "And then he heard her\r say:\r \r  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!", "Let Curdken’s hat go!", "Blow, breezes, blow!", "Let him after it go!", "O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r   Away be it whirl’d\r   Till the silvery locks\r   Are all comb’d and curl’d!", "And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away\r went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\r hair.", "All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\r when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\r and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That\r I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’\r \r But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\r him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word.", "And it was very\r lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\r royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was\r so beautiful.", "Then he called his son and told him that he had only a\r false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true\r bride stood by.", "And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and\r heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to\r the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all\r his court.", "The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one\r side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her\r beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all\r like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.", "When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\r he would tell them a tale.", "So he began, and told all the story of the\r princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\r true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would\r behave thus.", "‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she\r should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that\r two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to\r street till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as\r thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young\r king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the\r kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came\r to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.", "THE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET\r \r \r 1.", "HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\r \r ‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\r ‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\r before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said\r Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’\r \r So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\r there till the evening.", "Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\r nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,\r I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not\r become them to go home on foot.", "So Chanticleer began to build a little\r carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\r it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\r home.", "‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;\r I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,\r if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came\r quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have\r you in my grounds?", "I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon\r that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily.", "But Chanticleer was no\r coward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\r that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\r upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them.", "This she\r agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,\r duck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good\r pace.", "After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\r walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’\r and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\r dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\r friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\r drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\r that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\r carriage.", "Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\r likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\r promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\r tread on Partlet’s toes.", "Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\r the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\r deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\r quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\r house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\r however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\r had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\r the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\r they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.", "Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\r stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\r egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\r fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\r and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair\r and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\r away as softly as possible.", "However, the duck, who slept in the open\r air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\r close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.", "An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\r to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\r walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\r stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.", "‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my\r head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\r easy chair; but, oh dear!", "the needle ran into him; and this time the\r pain was not in his head.", "He now flew into a very great passion, and,\r suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\r after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\r would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\r reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.", "2.", "HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\r \r Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\r so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\r harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\r and away they drove.", "Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where\r are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,\r \r  ‘All on our way\r   A visit to pay\r   To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r \r Then the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my\r heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’\r \r  ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\r   Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!", "Now, mice, be ready,\r   And, wheels, run steady!", "For we are going a visit to pay\r   To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r \r Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\r Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\r them.", "When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice\r drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\r upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\r the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\r millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\r up in the towel.", "When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\r the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\r wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\r when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\r over his face and eyes.", "Then he was very angry, and went without his\r supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\r his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\r run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\r down on his head, and killed him on the spot.", "3.", "HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\r \r Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\r to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\r should be shared equally between them.", "Now Partlet found a very large\r nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\r herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\r stuck in her throat.", "Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\r Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\r shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\r said, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\r will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,\r and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to\r the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\r the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\r lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride\r said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\r in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\r from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\r the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\r the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\r Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\r quite dead, and never moved any more.", "Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\r came and wept with him over poor Partlet.", "And six mice built a little\r hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\r themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them.", "On the way they\r met the fox.", "‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he.", "‘To bury my\r Partlet,’ said the other.", "‘May I go with you?’ said the fox.", "‘Yes; but\r you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then\r the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\r all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.", "So on they went till they came to a rapid stream.", "‘How shall we get\r over?’ said Chanticleer.", "Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,\r and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the\r straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\r and were drowned.", "What was to be done?", "Then a large log of wood came\r and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\r shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed\r so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\r stream.", "Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\r offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\r and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\r managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\r who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\r and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.", "Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\r a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.", "Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\r died too; and so all were dead.", "RAPUNZEL\r \r \r There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\r child.", "At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.", "These people had a little window at the back of their house from which\r a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\r flowers and herbs.", "It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\r one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\r great power and was dreaded by all the world.", "One day the woman was\r standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\r bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\r looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\r and began to look pale and miserable.", "Then her husband was alarmed, and\r asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat\r some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\r die.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,\r bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’\r At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\r enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\r wife.", "She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.", "It\r tasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\r three times as much as before.", "If he was to have any rest, her husband\r must once more descend into the garden.", "In the gloom of evening\r therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\r wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\r him.", "‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my\r garden and steal my rampion like a thief?", "You shall suffer for it!’\r ‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\r up my mind to do it out of necessity.", "My wife saw your rampion from the\r window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\r had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\r softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow\r you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\r condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\r the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\r mother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\r woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\r child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.", "Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun.", "When she was\r twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\r a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\r little window.", "When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\r beneath it and cried:\r \r  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r   Let down your hair to me.’\r \r Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\r heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\r wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\r fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.", "After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through\r the forest and passed by the tower.", "Then he heard a song, which was so\r charming that he stood still and listened.", "This was Rapunzel, who in her\r solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.", "The king’s\r son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\r but none was to be found.", "He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\r touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\r listened to it.", "Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\r that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\r \r  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r   Let down your hair to me.’\r \r Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\r climbed up to her.", "‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\r will try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow\r dark, he went to the tower and cried:\r \r  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r   Let down your hair to me.’\r \r Immediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.", "At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\r had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to\r her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\r that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.", "Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\r him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\r thought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said\r yes, and laid her hand in his.", "She said: ‘I will willingly go away with\r you, but I do not know how to get down.", "Bring with you a skein of silk\r every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\r that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They\r agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\r old woman came by day.", "The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until\r once Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that\r you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king’s son--he\r is with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah!", "you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress.", "‘What do I hear you say!", "I thought I had separated you from all\r the world, and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched\r Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,\r seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut\r off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.", "And she was so pitiless\r that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\r grief and misery.", "On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\r fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\r window, and when the king’s son came and cried:\r \r  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r   Let down your hair to me.’\r \r she let the hair down.", "The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding\r his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\r wicked and venomous looks.", "‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch\r your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;\r the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well.", "Rapunzel is\r lost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son was beside\r himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower.", "He\r escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his\r eyes.", "Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but\r roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of\r his dearest wife.", "Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\r length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she\r had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.", "He heard a\r voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and\r when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept.", "Two\r of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could\r see with them as before.", "He led her to his kingdom where he was\r joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and\r contented.", "FUNDEVOGEL\r \r \r There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as\r he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\r there.", "He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\r the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\r asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in\r her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.", "The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\r ‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He\r took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together.", "And the\r one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\r had carried it away.", "Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\r when they did not see each other they were sad.", "Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\r began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\r to the spring.", "Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you\r fetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will\r tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,\r and then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester\r is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the\r kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’\r \r Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\r was gone the children were still in bed.", "Then Lina said to Fundevogel:\r ‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel\r said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then\r will I tell you.", "Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water\r into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said\r that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early\r tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle\r full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up\r quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’\r \r The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\r away.", "When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\r bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it.", "But when she came in,\r and went to the beds, both the children were gone.", "Then she was terribly\r alarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the\r forester comes home and sees that the children are gone?", "They must be\r followed instantly to get them back again.’\r \r Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\r overtake the children.", "The children, however, were sitting outside the\r forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\r said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’\r Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become\r a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to\r the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\r the children were nowhere.", "Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done\r here,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\r in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it.", "Then the\r old cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the\r rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\r you; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for\r the second time.", "The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.", "Then Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\r you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you\r become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three\r servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in\r it.", "They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go\r home.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;\r so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a\r chandelier in it.", "And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools!", "why\r did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home\r with you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with\r the three servants in pursuit of the children.", "The children, however,\r saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\r after them.", "Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will\r never leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’\r Said Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook,\r however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,\r and was about to drink it up.", "But the duck swam quickly to her, seized\r her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old\r witch had to drown.", "Then the children went home together, and were\r heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.", "THE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR\r \r \r One summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\r window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might.", "Then came\r a peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap!", "Good jams,\r cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his\r delicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman;\r here you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps\r to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\r for him.", "He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\r at length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\r ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\r consequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\r what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling.", "‘Now, this jam\r shall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health\r and strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\r a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it.", "‘This won’t\r taste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I\r take a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\r bigger and bigger stitches.", "In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\r rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\r attracted and descended on it in hosts.", "‘Hi!", "who invited you?’ said the\r little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away.", "The flies, however,\r who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\r again in ever-increasing companies.", "The little tailor at last lost all\r patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\r and saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on\r them.", "When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\r than seven, dead and with legs stretched out.", "‘Are you a fellow of that\r sort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery.", "‘The whole\r town shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\r a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at\r one stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear\r of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail.", "The tailor\r put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\r thought his workshop was too small for his valour.", "Before he went away,\r he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\r take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\r he put in his pocket.", "In front of the door he observed a bird which\r had caught itself in the thicket.", "It had to go into his pocket with the\r cheese.", "Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\r he felt no fatigue.", "The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\r reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\r peacefully about him.", "The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\r and said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\r wide-spread world!", "I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.", "Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously\r at the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin!", "You miserable creature!’\r \r ‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\r showed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I\r am!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had\r been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\r for the tiny fellow.", "Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\r a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\r of it.", "‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is\r that all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his\r hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\r the liquid ran out of it.", "‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,\r wasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\r of the little man.", "Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\r that the eye could scarcely follow it.", "‘Now, little mite of a man, do\r that likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone\r came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\r back at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\r and threw it into the air.", "The bird, delighted with its liberty,\r rose, flew away and did not come back.", "‘How does that shot please you,\r comrade?’ asked the tailor.", "‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant,\r ‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He\r took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\r the ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\r tree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you\r the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\r after all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his\r shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\r could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\r tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\r whistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if\r carrying the tree were child’s play.", "The giant, after he had dragged the\r heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark\r you, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,\r seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\r to the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\r the tree!’\r \r They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\r hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\r down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat.", "But the little\r tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\r it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.", "When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is\r this?", "Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no\r lack of strength,’ answered the little tailor.", "‘Do you think that could\r be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow?", "I leapt over\r the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.", "Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he\r could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\r that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.", "The giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\r cavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and\r followed him.", "When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\r there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\r was eating it.", "The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much\r more spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and\r said he was to lie down in it and sleep.", "The bed, however, was too\r big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\r a corner.", "When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\r tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\r cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\r grasshopper for good.", "With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\r forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\r walked up to them quite merrily and boldly.", "The giants were terrified,\r they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\r great hurry.", "The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.", "After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\r palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.", "Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\r read on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does\r the great warrior want here in the midst of peace?", "He must be a mighty\r lord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\r opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\r man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart.", "The counsel pleased\r the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer\r him military service when he awoke.", "The ambassador remained standing by\r the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,\r and then conveyed to him this proposal.", "‘For this very reason have\r I come here,’ the tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’s\r service.’ He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling\r was assigned him.", "The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\r him a thousand miles away.", "‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said\r among themselves.", "‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\r seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\r him.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\r the king, and begged for their dismissal.", "‘We are not prepared,’ said\r they, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was\r sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\r wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\r have been rid of him again.", "But he did not venture to give him his\r dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people\r dead, and place himself on the royal throne.", "He thought about it for a\r long time, and at last found good counsel.", "He sent to the little tailor\r and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one\r request to make to him.", "In a forest of his country lived two giants,\r who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,\r and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in\r danger of death.", "If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he\r would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a\r dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.", "‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the\r little tailor.", "‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a\r kingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon\r subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen\r to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of\r two.’\r \r The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.", "When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\r ‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then\r he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left.", "After a\r while he perceived both giants.", "They lay sleeping under a tree, and\r snored so that the branches waved up and down.", "The little tailor, not\r idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\r tree.", "When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat\r just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on\r the breast of one of the giants.", "For a long time the giant felt nothing,\r but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you\r knocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking\r you.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\r threw a stone down on the second.", "‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried\r the other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered\r the first, growling.", "They disputed about it for a time, but as they were\r weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more.", "The\r little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and\r threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant.", "‘That\r is too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\r companion against the tree until it shook.", "The other paid him back in\r the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\r belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\r the ground at the same time.", "Then the little tailor leapt down.", "‘It is\r a lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which\r I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a\r squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave\r each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the\r horsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them\r off, but it was hard work!", "They tore up trees in their sore need, and\r defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\r like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not\r wounded?’ asked the horsemen.", "‘You need not concern yourself about\r that,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The\r horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\r found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\r torn-up trees.", "The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\r repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\r rid of the hero.", "‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\r kingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed.", "In\r the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\r it first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants.", "Seven at one\r blow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went\r forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\r wait outside.", "He had not long to seek.", "The unicorn soon came towards\r him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\r horn without more ado.", "‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as\r that,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\r close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree.", "The unicorn ran against\r the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\r that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\r was caught.", "‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out\r from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\r axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\r beast away and took it to the king.", "The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\r demand.", "Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\r made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\r help.", "‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not\r take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\r that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\r such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him.", "When\r the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\r whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\r fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\r once, and in one bound out again.", "The boar ran after him, but the tailor\r ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\r beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\r was caught.", "The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\r might see the prisoner with their own eyes.", "The hero, however, went to\r the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his\r promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom.", "Had he known\r that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before\r him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did.", "The wedding\r was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a\r king was made.", "After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\r night: ‘Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\r will rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what\r state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained\r of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of\r her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor.", "The king comforted her\r and said: ‘Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants\r shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\r him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\r world.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the king’s armour-bearer,\r who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of\r the whole plot.", "‘I’ll put a screw into that business,’ said the little\r tailor.", "At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and\r when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,\r and then lay down again.", "The little tailor, who was only pretending to\r be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make me the doublet\r and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your\r ears.", "I smote seven at one blow.", "I killed two giants, I brought away one\r unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\r outside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\r were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\r behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\r him.", "So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\r life.", "HANSEL AND GRETEL\r \r \r Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\r two children.", "The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel.", "He had\r little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\r land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.", "Now when he thought\r over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\r groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us?", "How are we\r to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\r ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early\r tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\r it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\r of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\r leave them alone.", "They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\r rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I\r bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\r soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we\r must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\r coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented.", "‘But I feel very\r sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.", "The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\r heard what their stepmother had said to their father.", "Gretel wept\r bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,\r Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\r to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\r on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside.", "The moon\r shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\r glittered like real silver pennies.", "Hansel stooped and stuffed the\r little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in.", "Then he went\r back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\r peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed.", "When\r day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the\r two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards!", "we are going into the\r forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:\r ‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\r for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,\r as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket.", "Then they all set out together\r on the way to the forest.", "When they had walked a short time, Hansel\r stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.", "His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\r behind for?", "Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,\r father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is\r sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:\r ‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\r shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\r the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\r out of his pocket on the road.", "When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,\r children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\r be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\r little hill.", "The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\r very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\r fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood.", "When we\r have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’\r \r Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\r piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\r believed that their father was near.", "It was not the axe, however, but\r a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\r blowing backwards and forwards.", "And as they had been sitting such a long\r time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.", "When\r at last they awoke, it was already dark night.", "Gretel began to cry and\r said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted\r her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\r will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\r his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\r newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.", "They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\r to their father’s house.", "They knocked at the door, and when the woman\r opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty\r children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\r never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\r him to the heart to leave them behind alone.", "Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\r land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\r father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\r is the end.", "The children must go, we will take them farther into the\r wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\r means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:\r ‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\r children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\r say, but scolded and reproached him.", "He who says A must say B, likewise,\r and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\r also.", "The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.", "When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\r out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\r the door, and Hansel could not get out.", "Nevertheless he comforted his\r little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\r good God will help us.’\r \r Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\r beds.", "Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\r than the time before.", "On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\r in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.", "‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I\r am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\r wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel.", "‘Fool!’ said the woman,\r ‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\r on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\r on the path.", "The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\r never in their lives been before.", "Then a great fire was again made, and\r the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\r you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\r the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When\r it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\r scattered his by the way.", "Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\r no one came to the poor children.", "They did not awake until it was dark\r night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,\r Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\r which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When\r the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\r thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\r them all up.", "Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but\r they did not find it.", "They walked the whole night and all the next day\r too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\r and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\r berries, which grew on the ground.", "And as they were so weary that their\r legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\r asleep.", "It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house.", "They\r began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\r help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness.", "When it\r was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\r which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it.", "And\r when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\r and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\r which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\r that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\r were of clear sugar.", "‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and\r have a good meal.", "I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\r some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and\r broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\r against the window and nibbled at the panes.", "Then a soft voice cried\r from the parlour:\r \r  ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\r   Who is nibbling at my little house?’\r \r The children answered:\r \r  ‘The wind, the wind,\r   The heaven-born wind,’\r \r and went on eating without disturbing themselves.", "Hansel, who liked the\r taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\r the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\r it.", "Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\r supported herself on crutches, came creeping out.", "Hansel and Gretel were\r so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\r hands.", "The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear\r children, who has brought you here?", "do come in, and stay with me.", "No\r harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them\r into her little house.", "Then good food was set before them, milk and\r pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts.", "Afterwards two pretty little\r beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\r in them, and thought they were in heaven.", "The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\r a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\r little house of bread in order to entice them there.", "When a child fell\r into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\r day with her.", "Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\r a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.", "When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\r malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me\r again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\r already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\r pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That\r will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\r hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\r grated door.", "Scream as he might, it would not help him.", "Then she went to\r Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch\r some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\r stable outside, and is to be made fat.", "When he is fat, I will eat him.’\r Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\r forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.", "And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\r but crab-shells.", "Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\r cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\r be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and\r the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was\r Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening\r him.", "When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\r was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer.", "‘Now, then,\r Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.", "Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,\r how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\r and how her tears did flow down her cheeks!", "‘Dear God, do help us,’ she\r cried.", "‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\r at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’\r said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’\r \r Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\r the water, and light the fire.", "‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,\r ‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor\r Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.", "‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that\r we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\r shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.", "But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am\r to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman.", "‘The door\r is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and\r thrust her head into the oven.", "Then Gretel gave her a push that drove\r her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt.", "Oh!", "then\r she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless\r witch was miserably burnt to death.", "Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\r and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved!", "The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel\r sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened.", "How they did\r rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other!", "And\r as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s\r house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.", "‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his\r pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take\r something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full.", "‘But now we must\r be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’\r \r When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\r water.", "‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no\r bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white\r duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she\r cried:\r \r  ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\r   Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?", "There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\r   Take us across on thy back so white.’\r \r The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\r his sister to sit by him.", "‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy\r for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The\r good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\r walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\r to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house.", "Then\r they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\r their father’s neck.", "The man had not known one happy hour since he had\r left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead.", "Gretel\r emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\r room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\r add to them.", "Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\r in perfect happiness.", "My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\r catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.", "THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\r \r \r Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\r partnership and set up house together.", "For a long time all went well;\r they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\r considerably to their stores.", "The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the\r wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\r to the cooking.", "When people are too well off they always begin to long for something\r new.", "And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\r fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\r household arrangements.", "But the other bird sneered at him for being a\r poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\r at home and had a good time of it.", "For, when the mouse had made the fire\r and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\r until it was time to set the table.", "The sausage had only to watch the\r pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\r dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\r among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\r and salted, and ready to be served.", "Then, when the bird came home and\r had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\r finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\r morning: and that was really a very delightful life.", "Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\r the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\r and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\r change, and to try some other way of arranging the work.", "Beg and pray\r as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\r master of the situation, and the venture had to be made.", "They therefore\r drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\r to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.", "And now what happened?", "The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\r made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\r till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day.", "But the\r sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\r flew out to meet him.", "He had not flown far, however, when he came across\r a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\r booty, and so seized and swallowed him.", "The bird complained to the dog\r of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for\r the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and\r that was the reason his life had been forfeited.", "He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\r had seen and heard.", "They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\r best of things and to remain with one another.", "So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\r wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\r out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the\r pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having\r already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.", "Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\r could nowhere see the cook.", "In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\r here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to\r be found.", "Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,\r caught fire and began to blaze.", "The bird hastened to fetch some water,\r but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable\r to recover himself, he was drowned.", "MOTHER HOLLE\r \r \r Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\r was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy.", "The mother,\r however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\r daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\r to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\r family.", "Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\r the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed.", "Now it\r chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\r stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\r of her hand and fell into the well.", "She ran home crying to tell of her\r misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\r her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall\r into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’\r \r The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\r her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.", "She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\r beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\r in every direction.", "She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven\r full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us\r out, or alas!", "we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\r ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.", "She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.", "‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,\r are ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\r her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\r apple left upon it.", "Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\r heap and walked on again.", "The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\r woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\r turned to run away.", "But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you\r afraid of, dear child?", "Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\r properly for me, I will make you very happy.", "You must be very careful,\r however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\r it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\r in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman\r spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\r into her service.", "She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and\r every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\r feathers flew about like so many snowflakes.", "The old woman was as good\r as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and\r boiled meats every day.", "So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\r to grow unhappy.", "She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\r became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\r was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\r Holle than with her mother and sister.", "After waiting awhile, she went\r to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with\r you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own\r people.’\r \r Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back\r to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I\r will take you home myself.’\r \r Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway.", "The gate\r was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\r her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\r head to foot.", "‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she\r spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.", "The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\r world close to her mother’s house.", "As she entered the courtyard, the\r cock who was perched on the well, called out:\r \r  ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!", "Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’\r \r Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\r covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome.", "She related to them\r all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\r great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\r and try her fortune.", "So she made the sister go and sit by the well\r and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\r thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\r she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.", "Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\r till she came to the oven.", "‘Take us out, take us out, or alas!", "we shall\r be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves\r as before.", "But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty\r my hands for you?’ and walked on.", "Presently she came to the apple-tree.", "‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\r apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried.", "But she only answered, ‘A nice\r thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and\r passed on.", "At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about\r the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\r herself without delay to the old woman.", "The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\r to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\r return.", "The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and\r the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in\r the mornings and refused to get up.", "Worse still, she neglected to\r make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the\r feathers might fly about.", "So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\r and told her she might go.", "The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\r thought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,\r as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\r through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\r pouring over her.", "‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut\r the gate.", "So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\r well called out as she saw her:\r \r  ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!", "Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’\r \r But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\r her as long as she lived.", "LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\r \r \r Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\r who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\r nothing that she would not have given to the child.", "Once she gave her a\r little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\r wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’\r \r One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\r of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\r and weak, and they will do her good.", "Set out before it gets hot, and\r when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\r or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\r get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good\r morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’\r \r ‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\r her hand on it.", "The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\r and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her.", "Red-Cap\r did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\r him.", "‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.", "‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’\r \r ‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’\r \r ‘To my grandmother’s.’\r \r ‘What have you got in your apron?’\r \r ‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\r have something good, to make her stronger.’\r \r ‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’\r \r ‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\r under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\r surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.", "The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature!", "what a nice\r plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.", "I must\r act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by\r the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how\r pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round?", "I believe,\r too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\r walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\r out here in the wood is merry.’\r \r Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\r here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\r she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\r please her too.", "It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\r in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\r flowers.", "And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\r still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\r deeper into the wood.", "Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked\r at the door.", "‘Who is there?’\r \r ‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf.", "‘She is bringing cake and wine; open\r the door.’\r \r ‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot\r get up.’\r \r The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\r word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her.", "Then\r he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\r and drew the curtains.", "Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\r and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\r remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.", "She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\r went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\r herself: ‘Oh dear!", "how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\r being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but\r received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.", "There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\r looking very strange.", "‘Oh!", "grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’\r \r ‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.", "‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.", "‘The better to see you with, my dear.’\r \r ‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’\r \r ‘The better to hug you with.’\r \r ‘Oh!", "but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’\r \r ‘The better to eat you with!’\r \r And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\r bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.", "When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\r fell asleep and began to snore very loud.", "The huntsman was just passing\r the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring!", "I must\r just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he\r came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.", "‘Do I find you\r here, you old sinner!’ said he.", "‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as\r he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\r devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\r not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\r of the sleeping wolf.", "When he had made two snips, he saw the little\r Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\r sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been!", "How dark it was\r inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\r also, but scarcely able to breathe.", "Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\r great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,\r he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\r once, and fell dead.", "Then all three were delighted.", "The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and\r went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\r Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As\r long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\r wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’\r \r \r It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\r grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\r path.", "Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\r her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\r had said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\r that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\r have eaten her up.", "‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door,\r that he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\r ‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\r some cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\r stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\r intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\r steal after her and devour her in the darkness.", "But the grandmother\r saw what was in his thoughts.", "In front of the house was a great stone\r trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\r sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\r trough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full.", "Then the\r smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,\r and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep\r his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight\r into the great trough, and was drowned.", "But Red-Cap went joyously home,\r and no one ever did anything to harm her again.", "THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM\r \r \r There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\r grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\r for.", "He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who\r comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\r he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\r which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him.", "But the girl did\r not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.", "She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\r nor think of him without an inward shudder.", "One day he said to her, ‘You\r have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\r time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered.", "‘My house is\r out there in the dark forest,’ he said.", "She tried to excuse herself by\r saying that she would not be able to find the way thither.", "Her betrothed\r only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\r invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\r will strew ashes along the path.’\r \r When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\r dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\r be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\r lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along.", "On reaching the\r entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\r she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\r step she took.", "She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\r darkest part of the forest.", "There she saw a lonely house, looking so\r grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all.", "She stepped\r inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\r throughout.", "Suddenly a voice cried:\r \r  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r \r The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\r cage on the wall.", "Again it cried:\r \r  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r \r The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\r all empty, and still she saw no one.", "At last she came to the cellar,\r and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\r shaking.", "‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband\r lives here?’\r \r ‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to\r come to!", "This is a murderers’ den.", "You think yourself a promised bride,\r and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\r you will keep your marriage feast.", "Look, do you see that large cauldron\r of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire!", "As soon as they have\r you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\r you, for they are eaters of men.", "If I did not take pity on you and save\r you, you would be lost.’\r \r Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\r from view.", "‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,\r or it will be all over with you.", "Tonight, when the robbers are\r all asleep, we will flee together.", "I have long been waiting for an\r opportunity to escape.’\r \r The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\r dragging another young girl along with them.", "They were all drunk, and\r paid no heed to her cries and lamentations.", "They gave her wine to drink,\r three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\r and with that her heart gave way and she died.", "Then they tore off her\r dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\r pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.", "The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\r cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\r the robbers.", "One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\r the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off\r easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang\r into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was\r hiding there.", "The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he\r could not find it.", "‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of\r the others.", "But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,\r and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’\r \r ‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\r the finger and sat down.", "The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\r long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\r snoring.", "As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind\r the cask.", "She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who\r were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed\r dread lest she should awaken them.", "But God helped her, so that she\r passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,\r opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’\r den.", "They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and\r lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide\r them in the moonlight along the path.", "All night long they walked, and it\r was morning before they reached the mill.", "Then the girl told her father\r all that had happened.", "The day came that had been fixed for the marriage.", "The bridegroom\r arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\r care to invite all his friends and relations.", "As they sat at the feast,\r each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did\r not say a word.", "‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no\r tale you know?", "Tell us something.’\r \r ‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride.", "‘I went alone through a\r forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but\r a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\r \r  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r \r and again a second time it said these words.’\r \r ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r \r ‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\r and everything was so grim and mysterious.", "At last I went down to the\r cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\r head still.", "I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,\r “Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed\r does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards\r cook and eat you.”’\r \r ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r \r ‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\r this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\r them.", "They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\r yellow, and with that she died.’\r \r ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r \r ‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\r pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’\r \r ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r \r ‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\r finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut\r off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the\r great cask into my lap.", "And here is the finger with the ring.’ And\r with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\r assembled guests.", "The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\r tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast.", "They\r delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\r condemned to death for their wicked deeds.", "TOM THUMB\r \r \r A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\r fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning.", "‘How lonely it is,\r wife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me\r to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\r us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’\r ‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round\r her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child!", "If it were\r ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\r happy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\r pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\r had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\r quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb.", "So\r they said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\r little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas\r Thumb.", "They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\r bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.", "Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\r be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.", "One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\r fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\r want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;\r the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman\r laughed, and said, ‘How can that be?", "you cannot reach up to the horse’s\r bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only\r harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\r go.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’\r \r When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\r Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\r to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse\r went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\r wood.", "It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\r was calling out, ‘Gently!", "gently!’ two strangers came up.", "‘What an odd\r thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a\r carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,\r indeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it\r goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\r place where the woodman was.", "Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\r out, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe!", "now take\r me down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\r the other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a\r straw, where he sat as merry as you please.", "The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\r to say for wonder.", "At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That\r little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\r about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to\r the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man.", "‘He\r will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell\r him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\r than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the\r bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder\r and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;\r I’ll soon come back to you.’\r \r So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\r large piece of gold, and they paid the price.", "‘Where would you like to\r sit?’ said one of them.", "‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be\r a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we\r go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\r father they took him away with them.", "They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\r said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and\r put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\r road.", "But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into\r an old mouse-hole.", "‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off!", "mind and\r look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place,\r and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;\r Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite\r dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as\r sulky as could be.", "When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place.", "‘What\r dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field!", "If I were to\r fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’\r At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell.", "‘This is\r lucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.", "Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\r together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s\r house of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom.", "‘What noise\r was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’\r They stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll\r soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said\r they.", "‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the\r sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him\r up in their hands.", "‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for\r us?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house,\r and throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the\r thieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’\r \r When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the\r window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\r ‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,\r and said, ‘Softly, softly!", "Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’\r But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,\r ‘How much will you have?", "Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in\r the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and\r listened.", "Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little\r way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little\r urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and\r whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your\r roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out\r as loud as he could, ‘Very well!", "hold your hands!", "here it comes.’\r \r The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\r open the door.", "The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and\r the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.", "By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when\r she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found\r nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her\r eyes open.", "The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\r place to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\r to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\r mother.", "But alas!", "how woefully he was undone!", "what crosses and sorrows\r happen to us all in this world!", "The cook got up early, before daybreak,\r to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away\r a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast\r asleep.", "He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found\r himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the\r cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it.", "‘Good\r lack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon\r found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about\r him, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to\r death.", "At last down he went into her stomach.", "‘It is rather dark,’ said\r he; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a\r candle would be no bad thing.’\r \r Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\r all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\r down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller.", "At last he\r cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay!", "Don’t bring\r me any more hay!’\r \r The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\r speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\r that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\r her stool, and overset the milk-pail.", "As soon as she could pick herself\r up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\r parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson\r said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the\r cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.", "Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t\r bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and\r thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\r spot.", "So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\r lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.", "Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\r task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\r ill-luck befell him.", "A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\r whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.", "Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\r not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\r out, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’\r said the wolf.", "‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own\r father’s house.", "‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and\r then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold\r chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can\r wish.’\r \r The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\r the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into\r the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content.", "As soon as\r he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that\r he could not go out by the same way he came in.", "This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\r great shout, making all the noise he could.", "‘Will you be easy?’ said the\r wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’\r ‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now\r I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as\r loud as he could.", "The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\r a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\r suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\r axe, and gave his wife a scythe.", "‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman,\r ‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the\r scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father!", "I am here,\r the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised!", "we\r have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the\r scythe for fear she should hurt him.", "Then he aimed a great blow, and\r struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot!", "and when he was\r dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free.", "‘Ah!’ said the father,\r ‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have\r travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we\r parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’\r ‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father.", "‘I have been in a\r mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the\r wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’\r \r ‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again\r for all the riches in the world.’\r \r Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\r to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\r clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.", "So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for\r though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many\r fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always\r agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!", "RUMPELSTILTSKIN\r \r \r By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\r of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill.", "The miller’s house was\r close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.", "She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\r of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\r hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw.", "Now\r this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast\r his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\r him.", "Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\r heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must\r be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain\r that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\r for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\r door was locked, and she was left alone.", "She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\r fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\r hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\r weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and\r I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it\r for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden.", "He took her at her word,\r and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\r \r  ‘Round about, round about,\r     Lo and behold!", "Reel away, reel away,\r     Straw into gold!’\r \r And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\r the straw was all spun into gold.", "When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\r but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\r miller’s daughter again with a fresh task.", "Then she knew not what to do,\r and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\r said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’\r said she.", "So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\r wheel again, and whistled and sang:\r \r  ‘Round about, round about,\r     Lo and behold!", "Reel away, reel away,\r     Straw into gold!’\r \r till, long before morning, all was done again.", "The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\r but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet\r larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\r you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and\r said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’\r ‘I have nothing left,’ said she.", "‘Then say you will give me,’ said\r the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are\r queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she\r knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he\r asked.", "Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once\r more spun the heap into gold.", "The king came in the morning, and, finding\r all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s\r daughter, and she really became queen.", "At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\r dwarf, and what she had said.", "But one day he came into her room, where\r she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it.", "Then\r she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all\r the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at\r last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’\r grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your\r child.’\r \r Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\r she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\r out new ones.", "The next day the little man came, and she began with\r TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\r remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my\r name.’\r \r The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\r BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\r still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’\r \r The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have\r travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as\r I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox\r and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before\r the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was\r dancing upon one leg, and singing:\r \r  “Merrily the feast I’ll make.", "Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;\r   Merrily I’ll dance and sing,\r   For next day will a stranger bring.", "Little does my lady dream\r   Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”\r \r When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\r friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\r to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\r arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up.", "Then the little man began\r to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with\r him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my\r name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she.", "‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’\r ‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?’ said the\r lady slyly.", "‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried\r the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\r floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\r out.", "Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\r baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\r trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a\r merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’\r \r \r \r \r CLEVER GRETEL\r \r \r There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\r when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\r was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when\r she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,\r and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she\r was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what\r the food is like.’\r \r It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a\r guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will\r see to it, master,’ answered Gretel.", "She killed two fowls, scalded them,\r plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\r the fire, that they might roast.", "The fowls began to turn brown, and were\r nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived.", "Then Gretel called out\r to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\r from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\r the moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run\r myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,\r Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing\r so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\r when they will come?", "Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\r drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’\r and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\r not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.", "Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\r and drove the spit merrily round.", "But as the roast meat smelt so good,\r Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’\r She touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah!", "how good fowls are!", "It\r certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\r time!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\r his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\r ‘One of the wings is burning!", "I had better take it off and eat it.’\r So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\r thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\r something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and\r looked for her master, and did not see him.", "It suddenly occurred to\r her: ‘Who knows?", "They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\r somewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\r been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\r eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’\r So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\r one chicken in great glee.", "When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\r and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\r ‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s\r right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\r another draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty\r drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.", "While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry\r up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will\r soon serve up,’ answered Gretel.", "Meantime the master looked to see that\r the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\r going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps.", "Presently\r the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.", "Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\r she put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush!", "hush!", "go away as quickly\r as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\r certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\r two ears.", "Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest\r heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\r could.", "Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\r ‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel?", "What do you mean by\r that?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just\r going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a\r nice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens.", "‘If he had\r but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to\r him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear.", "Then he ran after him\r with the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning\r that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both.", "The\r guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of\r his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take\r them both with him.", "THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\r \r \r There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\r of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\r hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\r out of his mouth.", "His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so\r the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\r and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\r of it.", "And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\r tears.", "Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\r fell to the ground and broke.", "The young wife scolded him, but he said\r nothing and only sighed.", "Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\r half-pence, out of which he had to eat.", "They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\r began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground.", "‘What are\r you doing there?’ asked the father.", "‘I am making a little trough,’\r answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’\r \r The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\r began to cry.", "Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\r henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\r did spill a little of anything.", "THE LITTLE PEASANT\r \r \r There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\r peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant.", "He\r had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\r yet he and his wife did so wish to have one.", "One day he said to her:\r ‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\r make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\r other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman\r also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\r the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\r hanging down as if it were eating.", "Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\r called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,\r but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All\r right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\r it among the grass.", "The little calf always remained standing like one\r which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,\r just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the\r herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat\r your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you\r home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and\r waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\r the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was.", "The\r cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating.", "It would not\r stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must\r have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together,\r but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone.", "The cow-herd said: ‘It\r must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me\r that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness\r condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.", "And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\r so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\r it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed.", "They\r salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\r the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds.", "On\r the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,\r and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin.", "But as the\r weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could\r go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter.", "The\r miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay\r yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.", "The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman\r thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the\r parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is\r out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard\r them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make\r shift with a slice of bread and cheese.", "Then the woman served up four\r different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.", "Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\r outside.", "The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens!", "It is my husband!’ she quickly\r hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\r the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\r on the porch.", "Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank\r heaven, you are back again!", "There is such a storm, it looks as if the\r world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the\r straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the\r wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\r shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\r the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get\r me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and\r cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as\r I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and\r said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to\r be invited twice, but got up and ate.", "After this the miller saw the skin\r in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you\r there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can\r he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller.", "‘Why not?’ answered\r the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\r himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something\r for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked\r and made a noise like krr, krr.", "The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The\r peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine\r hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there\r and found the wine.", "‘Now go on,’ said he.", "The peasant made the raven\r croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some\r roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and\r went thither, and found the roast meat.", "The peasant made the raven\r prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some\r salad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and\r went there and found the salad.", "At last the peasant pinched the raven\r once more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there\r are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the\r miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.", "And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife\r was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\r her.", "The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little\r peasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth\r is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much\r the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on\r three hundred talers.", "Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s\r head till he croaked loudly.", "The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The\r peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in\r the closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and\r opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,\r and the peasant unlocked the closet.", "The parson ran out as fast as he\r could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my\r own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with\r the three hundred talers.", "At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\r house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to\r the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\r shovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\r bidden to say from whence his wealth came.", "He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s\r skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard\r that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed\r all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in\r the town to the greatest advantage.", "The mayor, however, said: ‘But my\r servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he\r did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others\r came, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all\r these skins?’\r \r Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\r outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\r treachery before the mayor.", "The innocent little peasant was unanimously\r sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\r pierced full of holes.", "He was led forth, and a priest was brought who\r was to say a mass for his soul.", "The others were all obliged to retire to\r a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the\r man who had been with the miller’s wife.", "He said to him: ‘I set you free\r from the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up\r came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had\r long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I\r will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The\r shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about?", "What is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make\r me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’\r The shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be\r mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you\r will get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in,\r and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s\r flock for himself, and drove it away.", "The parson went to the crowd,\r and declared that the mass had been said.", "Then they came and rolled the\r barrel towards the water.", "When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd\r cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than\r that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is\r what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below\r there,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.", "After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\r village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\r sheep and looking quite contented.", "Then the peasants were astonished,\r and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come?", "Have you come out of the\r water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,\r until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\r barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\r of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\r me.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,\r ‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that\r they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\r mayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just\r then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\r are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\r the peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor\r pressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and\r if things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash!", "went\r the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\r plunged in after him as one man.", "Then the entire village was dead, and\r the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.", "FREDERICK AND CATHERINE\r \r \r There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\r Catherine, and they had not long been married.", "One day Frederick said.", "‘Kate!", "I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\r hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’\r ‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew\r nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\r put it on the fire to fry.", "The steak soon began to look brown, and to\r crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\r then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\r to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a\r large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask.", "The beer ran\r into the jug and Catherine stood looking on.", "At last it popped into her\r head, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\r that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\r the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\r it.", "Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\r faster than she, and stuck close to the steak.", "‘It’s all gone, and “what\r can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine.", "So she turned round;\r and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\r to cool herself.", "Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\r the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\r the cask was empty.", "When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\r happened.", "‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from\r seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last\r remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\r and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\r nicely.", "‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal!", "we have\r now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set\r it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\r all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also.", "‘Ah!", "well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she\r strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her\r cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’\r \r At noon Frederick came home.", "‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for\r dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but\r while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\r I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\r with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the\r cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,\r ‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the\r ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I\r did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’\r \r The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must\r look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\r said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are!", "I shall put\r them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you\r never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that\r I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with\r earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.", "‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if\r you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow\r buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden\r and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare\r not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these\r yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of\r plates and dishes.", "Then she set them all about the house for a show:\r and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been\r doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow\r buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves\r and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of\r work you have made!", "those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you\r to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any\r harm in it; you should have told me.’\r \r Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\r ‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\r the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter\r and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’\r ‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\r fastest, he left his wife some way behind.", "‘It does not matter,’ thought\r she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’\r \r Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\r was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees\r on each side as they passed.", "‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have\r bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she\r took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so\r that the wheels might not hurt them so much.", "While she was doing this\r kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down\r the hill.", "Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she\r said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he\r has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after\r it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill.", "But she said\r she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she\r could not stay there all day waiting for them.", "At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\r eat.", "Then she gave him the dry bread.", "‘Where are the butter and cheese?’\r said he.", "‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor\r trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I\r sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on\r the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly\r things!’ said the husband.", "‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure\r you never told me not.’\r \r They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you\r locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did\r not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’\r said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’\r \r Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\r ‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of\r butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,\r for I have often seen him take some.’\r \r When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\r took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but\r surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took\r her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried\r out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as\r carefully as you please.’ ‘Alas!", "alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I\r have!", "I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so\r that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have\r brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’\r ‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the\r nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if\r you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’\r \r Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\r into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\r when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.", "Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\r were looking for.", "They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\r class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;\r so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\r Catherine were.", "Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\r some stones.", "Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on\r the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for\r the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’\r \r Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\r but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\r softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not\r now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,\r then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled\r the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,\r it is hailing.’\r \r A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\r so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray\r don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said\r she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\r said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’\r \r At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that\r was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw\r the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he\r was sure it would betray them.", "‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down\r went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried\r out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they\r could, and left all the gold.", "So when Frederick and Catherine came down,\r there they found all their money safe and sound.", "SWEETHEART ROLAND\r \r \r There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\r daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\r her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\r because she was her stepdaughter.", "The stepdaughter once had a pretty\r apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\r told her mother that she must and would have that apron.", "‘Be quiet, my\r child,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it.", "Your stepsister has\r long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her\r head off.", "Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and\r push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor\r girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard\r everything.", "All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime\r had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\r far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\r front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall.", "In\r the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right\r hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,\r and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s\r head off.", "When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\r was called Roland, and knocked at his door.", "When he came out, she said\r to him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\r wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child.", "When daylight comes,\r and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland,\r ‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape\r if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the\r dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in\r front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs.", "Then she\r hurried away with her lover.", "When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\r wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come.", "Then the witch\r cried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered\r the first drop of blood.", "The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\r stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am\r warming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood.", "She went into the\r kitchen, but found no one.", "Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah,\r here in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood.", "She went\r into the room to the bed.", "What did she see there?", "Her own child,\r whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood.", "The witch fell into\r a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\r into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\r sweetheart Roland.", "‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you\r have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her\r many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step,\r and it was not long before she overtook them.", "The girl, however, when\r she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic\r wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\r swimming in the middle of it.", "The witch placed herself on the shore,\r threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\r but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\r go home at night as she had come.", "At this the girl and her sweetheart\r Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole\r night until daybreak.", "Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful\r flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\r Roland into a fiddler.", "It was not long before the witch came striding up\r towards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that\r beautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to\r you while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was\r just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower\r was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced\r to dance, for it was a magical dance.", "The faster he played, the more\r violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes\r from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he\r did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.", "As they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and\r arrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and\r wait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will\r change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the\r girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.", "But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\r fascinated him that he forgot the maiden.", "The poor girl remained there a\r long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\r changed herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come\r this way, and trample me down.’\r \r It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\r the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\r laid it away in his chest.", "From that time forth, strange things happened\r in the shepherd’s house.", "When he arose in the morning, all the work was\r already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the\r fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,\r when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served.", "He\r could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being\r in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it.", "He was\r certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so\r afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice.", "The wise\r woman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some\r morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no\r matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will\r be stopped.’\r \r The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\r he saw the chest open, and the flower come out.", "Swiftly he\r sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it.", "Instantly the\r transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\r who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\r time she had attended to his house-keeping.", "She told him her story,\r and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\r answered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\r Roland, although he had deserted her.", "Nevertheless, she promised not to\r go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.", "And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,\r and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\r that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\r bridal pair.", "When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\r that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\r but the other girls came and took her.", "When it came to her turn to sing,\r she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she\r could not refuse.", "But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s\r ears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true\r bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had\r vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart.", "Then\r the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and\r grief came to an end and joy began.", "SNOWDROP\r \r \r It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\r around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working\r at her window.", "The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and\r as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three\r drops of blood fell upon it.", "Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red\r drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little\r daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as\r black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow\r up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and\r her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.", "But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\r queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear\r to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was.", "She had a fairy\r looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\r herself in it, and say:\r \r  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!", "Of all the ladies in the land,\r   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r \r And the glass had always answered:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’\r \r But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\r old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.", "Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it\r as usual:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\r   But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’\r \r When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\r one of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\r that I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but\r his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\r said, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by\r herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would\r tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his\r heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to\r her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.", "Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\r the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm.", "In the\r evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for\r her little feet would carry her no further.", "Everything was spruce and\r neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there\r were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses\r with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by\r the wall stood seven little beds.", "As she was very hungry, she picked\r a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each\r glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest.", "So she\r tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too\r short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself\r down and went to sleep.", "By and by in came the masters of the cottage.", "Now they were seven little\r dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.", "They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not\r right.", "The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second,\r ‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my\r bread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth,\r ‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with\r my knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first\r looked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came\r running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his\r bed.", "But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come\r and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought\r their lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens!", "what a lovely child\r she is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake\r her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs\r in turn, till the night was gone.", "In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\r and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\r knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\r take good care of her.", "Then they went out all day long to their work,\r seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\r home; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where\r you are, so take care and let no one in.’\r \r But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\r must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\r said:\r \r  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!", "Of all the ladies in the land,\r   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r \r And the glass answered:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r   But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r   Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r   There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r   Is lovelier far, O queen!", "than thee.’\r \r Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\r always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.", "And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\r than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went\r her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt.", "Then she\r knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked\r out at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman!", "what have you to\r sell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all\r colours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good\r sort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.", "‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced!", "Let me\r lace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of\r any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work\r so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was\r stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead.", "‘There’s an end to all\r thy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home.", "In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\r grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the\r ground, as if she was quite dead.", "However, they lifted her up, and when\r they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she\r began to breathe, and very soon came to life again.", "Then they said, ‘The\r old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one\r in when we are away.’\r \r When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\r as before; but to her great grief it still said:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r   But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r   Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r   There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r   Is lovelier far, O queen!", "than thee.’\r \r Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\r Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\r another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\r comb.", "When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and\r cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone\r in.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave\r her the poisoned one.", "And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and\r put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,\r the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless.", "‘There you may\r lie,’ said the queen, and went her way.", "But by good luck the dwarfs\r came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on\r the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned\r comb.", "And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that\r had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to\r anyone.", "Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\r read the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die,\r if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\r ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\r whoever tasted it was sure to die.", "Then she dressed herself up as a\r peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage,\r and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and\r said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do\r as you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty\r apple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’\r ‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of?", "Do you\r think it is poisoned?", "Come!", "do you eat one part, and I will eat the\r other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the\r other side was poisoned.", "Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for\r the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she\r could wait no longer.", "But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,\r when she fell down dead upon the ground.", "‘This time nothing will save\r thee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it\r said:\r \r  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’\r \r And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\r be.", "When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\r lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid\r that she was quite dead.", "They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and\r washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little\r girl seemed quite dead.", "So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven\r watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they\r would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just\r as it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in\r the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might\r still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name\r was, and that she was a king’s daughter.", "And the coffin was set among\r the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched.", "And the\r birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came\r an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.", "And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\r though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\r as blood, and as black as ebony.", "At last a prince came and called at the\r dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\r letters.", "Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them\r to let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for\r all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and\r gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home\r with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop\r awoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe\r with me.’\r \r Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better\r than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall\r be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;\r and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their\r wedding.", "To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen;\r and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\r glass and said:\r \r  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!", "Of all the ladies in the land,\r   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r \r And the glass answered:\r \r  ‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\r   But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’\r \r When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\r were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride.", "And\r when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\r she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell\r down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily\r over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the\r mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind\r to Snowdrop in her time of need.", "THE PINK\r \r \r There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.", "Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\r bestow on her a son or a daughter.", "Then an angel from heaven came to her\r and said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,\r so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.’ Then\r she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time\r was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.", "Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\r beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream.", "It\r happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\r her arms and she fell asleep.", "Then came the old cook, who knew that the\r child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,\r and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen’s apron\r and on her dress.", "Then he carried the child away to a secret place,\r where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and\r accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by\r the wild beasts.", "When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed\r this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,\r in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into\r it, and walled up.", "Here she was to stay for seven years without meat\r or drink, and die of hunger.", "But God sent two angels from heaven in the\r shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her\r food until the seven years were over.", "The cook, however, thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power of\r wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So\r he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\r speak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\r a garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words out\r of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.", "After a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for you to be so\r alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son\r wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\r beautiful than any painter could have painted her.", "The two played\r together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\r went out hunting like a nobleman.", "The thought occurred to him, however,\r that the king’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus\r bring him into great peril.", "So he went out and took the maiden aside,\r and said: ‘Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this\r knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do\r not do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon he went away, and when\r he returned next day she had not done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed\r the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?’ The cook once\r more said: ‘If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When\r he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her\r to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,\r and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: ‘Lie down in\r your bed, and draw the clothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in\r and said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the\r plate to him, but the king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old\r sinner, why did you want to kill me?", "Now will I pronounce thy sentence.", "You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,\r and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\r throat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\r into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\r were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\r flames broke forth from his throat.", "The king’s son remained there a\r short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\r were still alive.", "At length he said to the maiden: ‘I will go home to my\r own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’\r she replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land\r where I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as they\r could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed\r into a beautiful pink, and took her with him.", "Then he went away to his\r own country, and the poodle had to run after him.", "He went to the tower\r in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for\r a ladder which would reach up to the very top.", "Then he mounted up and\r looked inside, and cried: ‘Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still\r alive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still\r satisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there.", "Said he: ‘I am your\r dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;\r but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.’ Then he descended\r again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a\r strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service.", "The king said\r yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to\r him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\r district or country.", "Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game\r for him as he could possibly use at the royal table.", "So he summoned all\r the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.", "And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end\r where he stationed himself, and began to wish.", "Two hundred deer and more\r came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.", "Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\r king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having\r had none at all for years.", "Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\r household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast.", "When\r they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ‘As you are\r so clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your majesty\r must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,\r and said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it.", "Whilst he was sitting\r there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\r king’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how\r it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,\r or had perished.", "Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,\r and said: ‘Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen\r living in the tower?", "Is she still alive, or has she died?’ But the king\r replied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will\r not have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and said: ‘Gracious lord\r father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away\r by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\r arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\r chicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:\r ‘That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and these the\r dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\r forth from its throat.", "On this the huntsman asked the king if he would\r like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form\r of the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron,\r and his knife by his side.", "When the king saw him he fell into a passion,\r and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon.", "Then the huntsman\r spoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me\r up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,\r though her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would\r like to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her\r to you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into\r his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\r and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.", "Then the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and\r wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\r beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.", "And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\r to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table.", "But when she was\r led in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful God who has\r supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three days\r more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white\r doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of\r heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave.", "The aged\r king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the\r king’s own heart, and he soon died.", "His son married the beautiful maiden\r whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they\r are still alive or not, is known to God.", "CLEVER ELSIE\r \r \r There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.", "And\r when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’\r said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At\r length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;\r but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart.", "‘Oh,’ said\r the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,\r she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’\r ‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When\r they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go\r into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher\r from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she\r went, so that the time might not appear long.", "When she was below she\r fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had\r no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected\r injury.", "Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and\r while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but\r looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\r pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left\r there.", "Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have\r a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\r beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she\r sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\r misfortune which lay before her.", "Those upstairs waited for the drink,\r but Clever Elsie still did not come.", "Then the woman said to the servant:\r ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and\r found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly.", "‘Elsie why\r do you weep?’ asked the maid.", "‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to\r weep?", "If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to\r draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill\r him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down\r beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.", "After a while,\r as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the\r beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see\r where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever\r Elsie and the girl both weeping together.", "Then he asked: ‘Why are you\r weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep?", "If I get Hans,\r and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the\r pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What\r a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to\r howl loudly.", "Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not\r return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see\r where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst\r of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told\r her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\r grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down.", "Then said the\r mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept\r with them.", "The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not\r come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the\r cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,\r and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and\r that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one\r into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if\r he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very\r time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat\r down, and likewise wept with them.", "The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone\r for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be\r waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’\r When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\r quite piteously, each out-doing the other.", "‘What misfortune has happened\r then?’ asked he.", "‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other\r and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw\r something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might\r dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to\r weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed\r for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and\r seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.", "After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work\r and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we\r may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had\r gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\r with her.", "When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I\r do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first?", "Oh, I will eat first.’ Then\r she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once\r more said: ‘What shall I do?", "Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?", "I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.", "Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said\r he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\r even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,\r Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she\r was lying among the corn asleep.", "Then Hans hastened home and brought\r a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she\r still went on sleeping.", "Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\r down in his chair and worked.", "At length, when it was quite dark, Clever\r Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about\r her, and the bells rang at each step which she took.", "Then she was\r alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or\r not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer\r to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:\r ‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure\r to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then\r she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’\r answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:\r ‘Ah, heavens!", "Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the\r people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\r could get in nowhere.", "Then she ran out of the village, and no one has\r seen her since.", "THE MISER IN THE BUSH\r \r \r A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\r him three years, without having been paid any wages.", "At last it came\r into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;\r so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long\r time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my\r trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very\r simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s\r service a penny.", "The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to\r have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad\r fare any longer?", "I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself\r merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming\r over hill and valley.", "As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\r met him, and asked him what made him so merry.", "‘Why, what should make\r me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\r should I care for?", "I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it\r all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.", "‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman.", "‘I wish you would give them\r to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and\r gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have\r such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every\r penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at\r his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I\r will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,\r a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and\r thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf\r said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,\r and went his way.", "Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,\r he was now ten times more so.", "He had not gone far before he met an old\r miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush\r singing away most joyfully.", "‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I\r would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’\r said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his\r bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.", "The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into\r the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the\r miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in\r the air.", "The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung\r in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\r the blood ran down.", "‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!", "master!", "pray let the fiddle alone.", "What have I done to deserve this?’\r ‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou\r art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune.", "Then the\r miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but\r he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced\r him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till\r at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,\r and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow.", "When the countryman\r saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took\r the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\r bargain.", "Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\r plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\r his late companion some trick.", "At last he went to the judge, and\r complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\r into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\r back and a fiddle hung round his neck.", "Then the judge sent out his\r officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\r was soon caught and brought up to be tried.", "The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of\r his money.", "‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the\r countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\r matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.", "So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord\r Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the\r other.", "‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon\r my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no!", "no!", "for\r heaven’s sake don’t listen to him!", "don’t listen to him!’ But the judge\r said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he\r could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.", "Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But\r the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\r note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and\r no one could hold the miser.", "At the second note the hangman let his\r prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first\r bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and\r all the people who had followed to look on.", "At first the thing was merry\r and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed\r to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him\r to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,\r till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him\r the hundred florins.", "Then he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where\r you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole\r it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge\r that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman\r stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.", "ASHPUTTEL\r \r \r The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\r nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be\r a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon\r afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;\r and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always\r good and kind to all about her.", "And the snow fell and spread a beautiful\r white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the\r sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife.", "This\r new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;\r they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time\r for the poor little girl.", "‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the\r parlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;\r away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and\r gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her\r into the kitchen.", "There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\r bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash.", "Besides that,\r the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her.", "In the\r evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made\r to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her\r always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.", "It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\r wife’s daughters what he should bring them.", "‘Fine clothes,’ said the\r first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second.", "‘Now, child,’ said he\r to his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear\r father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\r homewards,’ said she.", "Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes\r and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he\r rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost\r pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he\r got home he gave it to his daughter.", "Then she took it, and went to\r her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was\r watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree.", "Three\r times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came\r and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over\r her, and brought her whatever she wished for.", "Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\r last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\r a bride for himself.", "Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they\r called her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie\r our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’\r Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help\r crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have\r gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard\r to let her go.", "‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to\r wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to\r the ball?", "And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of\r her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in\r two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast\r too.’\r \r Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\r out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\r \r  ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,\r   Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!", "Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r   Hither, hither, haste away!", "One and all come help me, quick!", "Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’\r \r Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\r came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\r heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.", "And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\r pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\r them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish\r but left the ashes.", "Long before the end of the hour the work was quite\r done, and all flew out again at the windows.", "Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\r that now she should go to the ball.", "But the mother said, ‘No, no!", "you\r slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when\r Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s\r time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go\r too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her.", "So she\r shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.", "But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\r and cried out as before:\r \r  ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,\r   Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!", "Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r   Hither, hither, haste away!", "One and all come help me, quick!", "Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’\r \r Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\r turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\r chirping and hopping about.", "And they flew down into the ashes; and the\r little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\r then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\r into the dishes, and left all the ashes.", "Before half an hour’s time all\r was done, and out they flew again.", "And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\r her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.", "But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no\r clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off\r she went with her two daughters to the ball.", "Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\r sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\r \r  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r   Gold and silver over me!’\r \r Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\r silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\r on, and followed her sisters to the feast.", "But they did not know her,\r and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\r beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,\r taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.", "The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\r with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\r else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’\r \r Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\r go home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to\r your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived.", "But\r she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\r the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\r the door.", "Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\r the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\r pigeon-house.", "But when they had broken open the door they found no one\r within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\r she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\r lamp was burning in the chimney.", "For she had run as quickly as she could\r through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken\r off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird\r might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her\r little grey frock.", "The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\r sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\r \r  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r   Gold and silver over me!’\r \r And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she\r had worn the day before.", "And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\r wondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,\r took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to\r dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’\r \r When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here\r as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang\r away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.", "In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and\r Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without\r being seen.", "Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find\r out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said\r to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I\r think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to\r himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut\r down the tree, but found no one upon it.", "And when they came back into\r the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped\r down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes\r back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey\r frock.", "The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\r went again into the garden, and said:\r \r  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r   Gold and silver over me!’\r \r Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\r former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\r to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the\r king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to\r dance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’\r \r When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with\r her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,\r she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\r her left golden slipper upon the stairs.", "The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\r and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\r fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they\r had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden\r slipper.", "The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and\r wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by.", "But her great toe could\r not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her.", "Then\r the mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you\r are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So\r the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,\r and went to the king’s son.", "Then he took her for his bride, and set her\r beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.", "But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\r had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\r \r  ‘Back again!", "back again!", "look to the shoe!", "The shoe is too small, and not made for you!", "Prince!", "prince!", "look again for thy bride,\r   For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’\r \r Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\r blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him.", "So he\r turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\r and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put\r on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the\r shoe, all but the heel, which was too large.", "But her mother squeezed it\r in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her\r as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.", "But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\r and sang:\r \r  ‘Back again!", "back again!", "look to the shoe!", "The shoe is too small, and not made for you!", "Prince!", "prince!", "look again for thy bride,\r   For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’\r \r Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\r shoe, that her white stockings were quite red.", "So he turned his horse\r and brought her also back again.", "‘This is not the true bride,’ said he\r to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is\r only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\r sure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her.", "But the\r mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show\r herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed\r her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached\r her the golden slipper.", "Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,\r and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made\r for her.", "And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and\r said, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters\r were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his\r horse, and rode away with her.", "And when they came to the hazel-tree, the\r white dove sang:\r \r  ‘Home!", "home!", "look at the shoe!", "Princess!", "the shoe was made for you!", "Prince!", "prince!", "take home thy bride,\r   For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’\r \r And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\r her right shoulder, and so went home with her.", "THE WHITE SNAKE\r \r \r A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\r all the land.", "Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of\r the most secret things was brought to him through the air.", "But he had a\r strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,\r and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more\r dish.", "It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what\r was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\r cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.", "This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\r away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\r carrying the dish into his room.", "When he had carefully locked the door,\r he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish.", "But\r when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\r so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth.", "No sooner had it\r touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\r outside his window.", "He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\r the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of\r all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods.", "Eating\r the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.", "Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\r beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\r servant, who was allowed to go everywhere.", "The king ordered the man to\r be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\r could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked\r upon as guilty and executed.", "In vain he declared his innocence; he was\r dismissed with no better answer.", "In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\r how to help himself out of his trouble.", "Now some ducks were sitting\r together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they\r were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\r confidential conversation together.", "The servant stood by and listened.", "They were telling one another of all the places where they had been\r waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and\r one said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\r I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s\r window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the\r kitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’\r ‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared\r no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long\r enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the\r spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.", "The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\r amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him\r the best place in the court that he could wish for.", "The servant refused\r everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\r he had a mind to see the world and go about a little.", "When his request\r was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he\r saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water.", "Now, though\r it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must\r perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his\r horse and put the three prisoners back into the water.", "They leapt with\r delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you\r and repay you for saving us!’\r \r He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\r the sand at his feet.", "He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why\r cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies?", "That stupid\r horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\r mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to\r him: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’\r \r The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\r by their nest, and throwing out their young ones.", "‘Out with you, you\r idle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for\r you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’\r But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and\r crying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are!", "We must shift for ourselves,\r and yet we cannot fly!", "What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the\r good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave\r it to them for food.", "Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their\r hunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves\r another!’\r \r And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long\r way, he came to a large city.", "There was a great noise and crowd in\r the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s\r daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard\r task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had\r already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\r saw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\r forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.", "So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\r his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\r bottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will\r be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the\r people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him\r alone by the sea.", "He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\r he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\r fishes whose lives he had saved.", "The one in the middle held a mussel in\r its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he\r had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.", "Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him\r the promised reward.", "But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\r birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\r task.", "She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\r sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning\r before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\r wanting.’\r \r The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\r to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\r sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.", "But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\r all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single\r grain was missing.", "The ant-king had come in the night with thousands\r and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry\r picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.", "Presently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\r amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.", "But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he\r has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had\r brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where\r the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,\r as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding\r it.", "After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to\r a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep.", "But he heard a rustling in\r the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand.", "At the same time\r three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and\r said: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when\r we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,\r we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life\r stands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out\r homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter,\r who had now no more excuses left to make.", "They cut the Apple of Life in\r two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,\r and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.", "THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS\r \r \r There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\r loved them with all the love of a mother for her children.", "One day she\r wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food.", "So she called all\r seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\r be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\r all--skin, hair, and everything.", "The wretch often disguises himself, but\r you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The\r kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go\r away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way\r with an easy mind.", "It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\r ‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\r something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that\r it was the wolf, by the rough voice.", "‘We will not open the door,’ cried\r they, ‘you are not our mother.", "She has a soft, pleasant voice, but\r your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a\r shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made\r his voice soft with it.", "Then he came back, knocked at the door of the\r house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here\r and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf\r had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them\r and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\r like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I\r have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker\r had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some\r white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The\r wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you\r will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made\r his paws white for him.", "Truly, this is the way of mankind.", "So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\r it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother\r has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the\r forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that\r we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws\r in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they\r believed that all he said was true, and opened the door.", "But who should\r come in but the wolf!", "They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.", "One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the\r stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the\r sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case.", "But\r the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the\r other he swallowed them down his throat.", "The youngest, who was in\r the clock-case, was the only one he did not find.", "When the wolf had\r satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a\r tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep.", "Soon afterwards\r the old goat came home again from the forest.", "Ah!", "what a sight she saw\r there!", "The house-door stood wide open.", "The table, chairs, and benches\r were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts\r and pillows were pulled off the bed.", "She sought her children, but they\r were nowhere to be found.", "She called them one after another by name, but\r no one answered.", "At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice\r cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and\r it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others.", "Then\r you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.", "At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.", "When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored\r so loud that the branches shook.", "She looked at him on every side and\r saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly.", "‘Ah,\r heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has\r swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to\r run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\r open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one\r little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six\r sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered\r no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them\r down whole.", "What rejoicing there was!", "They embraced their dear mother,\r and jumped like a tailor at his wedding.", "The mother, however, said: ‘Now\r go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s\r stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged\r the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this\r stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the\r greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once\r stirred.", "When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\r and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\r go to a well to drink.", "But when he began to walk and to move about, the\r stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled.", "Then cried\r he:\r \r  ‘What rumbles and tumbles\r   Against my poor bones?", "I thought ‘twas six kids,\r   But it feels like big stones.’\r \r And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\r heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably.", "When the seven\r kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf\r is dead!", "The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with\r their mother.", "THE QUEEN BEE\r \r \r Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\r fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\r that they could not return home again.", "Then their brother, who was a\r little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when\r he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\r young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\r were so much wiser, had been unable to get on.", "However, they all set\r out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill.", "The two\r elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor\r ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs.", "But the\r little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not\r suffer you to trouble them.’\r \r So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\r about.", "The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them.", "But the\r dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill\r them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was\r so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to\r light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.", "But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy\r themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’\r \r At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\r stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\r no man was to be seen.", "Then they went through all the rooms, till they\r came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\r was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room.", "There they saw\r a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\r twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then\r he rose and came out to them.", "He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\r table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and\r drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.", "The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\r where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\r which the castle might be disenchanted.", "The first tablet said: ‘In the\r wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s\r daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\r he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’\r \r The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\r but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was\r turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.", "The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\r better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\r pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.", "At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\r was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat\r down upon a stone and cried.", "And as he sat there, the king of the ants\r (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\r it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\r heap.", "The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be\r fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\r he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\r dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.", "The third task was the hardest.", "It was to choose out the youngest and\r the best of the king’s three daughters.", "Now they were all beautiful, and\r all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of\r sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;\r so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.", "Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\r from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\r upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\r which was the youngest.", "Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\r turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms.", "And the dwarf\r married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\r her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.", "THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\r \r \r There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\r but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\r had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of\r shoes.", "Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning\r to rise early in the morning to his work.", "His conscience was clear and\r his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,\r left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep.", "In the morning after\r he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his\r great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table.", "The\r good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.", "He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the\r whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.", "The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\r he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\r shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.", "In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might\r get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for\r when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand.", "Soon\r in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought\r leather enough for four pair more.", "He cut out the work again overnight\r and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some\r time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and\r the good man soon became thriving and well off again.", "One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\r the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and\r watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\r me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\r themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\r there, and watched what would happen.", "As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\r they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work\r that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching\r and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\r wonder, and could not take his eyes off them.", "And on they went, till the\r job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.", "This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\r lightning.", "The next day the wife said to the shoemaker.", "‘These little wights have\r made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\r turn if we can.", "I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\r indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to\r keep off the cold.", "I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,\r and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and\r do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’\r \r The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\r all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\r work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\r watch what the little elves would do.", "About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\r room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\r saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\r mightily delighted.", "Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\r capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\r out at the door, and away over the green.", "The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\r from that time forward, as long as they lived.", "THE JUNIPER-TREE\r \r \r Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich\r man with a good and beautiful wife.", "They loved each other

house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.", "One winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and\r as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the\r snow.", "‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as\r blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew\r light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and\r she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.", "A month passed,\r and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all\r the earth was green.", "So the months followed one another, and first the\r trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly\r intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall.", "Once again the wife\r stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her\r heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that\r she fell on her knees.", "Presently the fruit became round and firm, and\r she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the\r berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill.", "A little\r while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping.", "‘If I\r die, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy\r again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and\r when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy\r was so great that she died.", "Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\r her.", "By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he\r still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later\r on he married again.", "He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\r was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow.", "The mother\r loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked\r at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in\r the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could\r get the whole of the property for her.", "This evil thought took possession\r of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy.", "She\r drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the\r poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left\r school to the time he went back.", "One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the\r store-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said\r the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\r had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.", "‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one\r too?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he\r comes out of school.’\r \r Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\r as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out\r of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before\r your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to.", "The\r little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say\r kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a\r wicked look.", "‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look!", "Yes, give\r me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him.", "‘Come\r with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one\r out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged\r her, and crash!", "down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.", "Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.", "‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought.", "So\r she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of\r her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and\r bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed\r him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.", "Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\r a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is\r sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\r and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\r frightened me.’\r \r ‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him\r a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me\r that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the\r ear, and his head rolled off.", "She was so terrified at this, that she ran\r crying and screaming to her mother.", "‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off\r brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.", "‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,\r so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make\r him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him\r into puddings, and put him in the pot.", "But Marleen stood looking on,\r and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no\r need of salt.", "Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\r ‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\r black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.", "The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’\r \r ‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s\r great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’\r \r ‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’\r \r ‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\r weeks; he is well looked after there.’\r \r ‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not\r be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’\r \r With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do\r you weep?", "Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more\r pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.", "Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\r her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\r table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but\r weep.", "Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and\r she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,\r and she wept no more.", "And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the\r branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and\r then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for\r joy.", "After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there\r was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful\r bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it\r could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the\r silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.", "Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\r still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to\r the table and ate.", "The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\r sing:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\r song of the bird on his roof.", "He thought it so beautiful that he got\r up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\r slippers.", "But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on\r one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still\r held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing\r up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.", "‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!", "Sing me that song again.’\r \r ‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing.", "Give that gold\r chain, and I will sing it you again.’\r \r ‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith.", "‘Only sing me that\r again.’\r \r The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then\r he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and\r sang:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\r shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his\r hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.", "‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the\r door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it\r and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the\r children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\r street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red\r and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two\r bright stars in its head.", "‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’\r \r ‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must\r give me something.’\r \r ‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will\r see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched\r the shoes.", "‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’\r \r The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\r went back to the roof and sang:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r When he had finished, he flew away.", "He had the chain in his right claw\r and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the\r mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were\r twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,\r hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click\r clack.’\r \r The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r \r then one of the men left off,\r \r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r \r two more men left off and listened,\r \r   My sister loved me best of all;\r \r then four more left off,\r \r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r \r now there were only eight at work,\r \r   Underneath\r \r And now only five,\r \r   the juniper-tree.", "And now only one,\r \r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r then he looked up and the last one had left off work.", "‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing!", "Let me hear it\r too; sing it again.’\r \r ‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\r millstone, and I will sing it again.’\r \r ‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’\r \r ‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’\r \r The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\r stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\r the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the\r tree and sang--\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r   My sister loved me best of all;\r   She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the\r chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round\r his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.", "The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.", "‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’\r \r ‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\r were coming.’\r \r But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.", "Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.", "‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun\r shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’\r \r ‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that\r my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and\r she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the\r corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.", "The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r \r the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\r nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a\r violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\r \r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r \r ‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so\r magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\r scent of spice in the air!’\r \r   My sister loved me best of all;\r \r then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.", "‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.", "‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife.", "‘I feel as if the whole house were in\r flames!’\r \r But the man went out and looked at the bird.", "She laid her kerchief over me,\r  And took my bones that they might lie\r  Underneath the juniper-tree\r  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\r man’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.", "He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has\r given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’\r \r But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,\r and her cap fell from her head.", "Then the bird began again:\r \r  ‘My mother killed her little son;\r \r ‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the\r earth, that I might not hear that song.’\r \r   My father grieved when I was gone;\r \r then the woman fell down again as if dead.", "My sister loved me best of all;\r \r ‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will\r give me anything.’\r \r So she went out.", "She laid her kerchief over me,\r   And took my bones that they might lie\r \r and he threw down the shoes to her,\r \r   Underneath the juniper-tree\r   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r \r And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\r danced and jumped about in them.", "‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I\r came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\r and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’\r \r The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\r of fire.", "‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten\r my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’\r \r But as she crossed the threshold, crash!", "the bird threw the millstone\r down on her head, and she was crushed to death.", "The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\r saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\r passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\r little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\r inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.", "THE TURNIP\r \r \r There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\r the other poor.", "The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\r pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\r and sowed turnips.", "When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\r it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\r growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for\r there never was such a one seen before, and never will again.", "At last it\r was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and\r the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it\r would be a blessing or a curse to him.", "One day he said to himself, ‘What\r shall I do with it?", "if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;\r and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing\r perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’\r \r Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\r to the king.", "‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many\r strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw.", "Where did you\r get the seed?", "or is it only your good luck?", "If so, you are a true child\r of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune;\r I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I\r laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground.", "I have a\r brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world\r knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’\r \r The king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no\r longer.", "I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your\r brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so\r rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.", "When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\r gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\r could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself.", "However, he\r determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a\r rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must\r have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so\r much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?", "The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\r give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\r the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.", "When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;\r and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to\r kill his brother.", "So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\r lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have\r found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\r us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\r together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out\r upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.", "But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\r horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\r prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\r cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away.", "Meantime\r he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out\r his head.", "When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\r who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went.", "As soon as\r the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good\r morning!", "good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about\r everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came\r from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’\r \r Then the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here\r I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great\r and wondrous things.", "Compared to this seat, all the learning of the\r schools is as empty air.", "A little longer, and I shall know all that man\r can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind.", "Here\r I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws\r that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the\r healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of\r precious stones.", "Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel\r and own the power of knowledge.", "The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\r ‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\r let me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if\r very unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou\r wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an\r hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown\r to me.’\r \r So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\r heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\r for his thirst for knowledge was great.", "Then the other pretended to give\r way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\r yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down,\r opened the sack, and set him free.", "‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend\r quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a\r while,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him\r in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after\r wisdom dangling in the air.", "‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he,\r ‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee?", "Rest there in peace,\r till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’\r \r So saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow\r to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.", "CLEVER HANS\r \r \r The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To\r Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well.", "Goodbye, mother.’\r ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.", "‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,\r Hans.", "What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have\r something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle,

It continued to\r extend in the south-western direction from the heroic period of\r the XVIIIth dynasty onwards, and all the eminence and valleys were\r gradually appropriated one after the other for burying-places. At the\r time of which I am speaking, this region formed an actual town, or\r rather a chain of villages, each of which was grouped round some\r building constructed by one or other of the Pharaohs as a funerary\r chapel. Towards the north, opposite Karnak, they clustered at\r Drah-abul-Neggah around pyramids of the first Theban monarchs, at\r Qurneh around the mausolæ of Ramses I. and Seti I., and at Sheikh\r Abd el-Qurneh they lay near the Amenopheum and the Pamonkaniqîmît,\r or Ramesseum built by Ramses II. Towards the south they diminished\r in number, tombs and monuments becoming fewer and appearing at wider\r intervals; the Migdol of Ramses III. formed an isolated suburb, that of\r Azamît, at Medinet-Habu; the chapel of Isis, constructed by Amenôthes,\r son of Hapû, formed a rallying-point for the huts of the hamlet of\r Karka;* and in the far distance, in a wild gorge at the extreme limit\r of human habitations, the queens of the Ramesside line slept their last\r sleep.\r \r      * The village of Karka or Kaka was identified by Brugsch\r      with the hamlet of Deîr el-Medineh: the founder of the\r      temple was none other than Amenôthes, who was minister under\r      Amenôthes III.\r \r [Illustration: 004.jpg THE THEBAN CEMETERIES]\r \r Each of these temples had around it its enclosing wall of dried brick,\r and the collection of buildings within this boundary formed the Khîrû,\r or retreat of some one of the Theban Pharaohs, which, in the official\r language of the time, was designated the august Khîrû of millions of\r years.\r \r [Illustration: 005.jpg THE NECROPOLIS OF SHEÎKH AND EL-QURNEH]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Beato.\r \r A sort of fortified structure, which was built into one of the corners,\r served as a place of deposit for the treasure and archives, and could be\r used as a prison if occasion required.*\r \r      * This was the hliatmû, the dungeon, frequently mentioned in\r      the documents bearing upon the necropolis.\r \r The remaining buildings consisted of storehouses, stables, and houses\r for the priests and other officials. In some cases the storehouses were\r constructed on a regular plan which the architect had fitted in with\r that of the temple. Their ruins at the back and sides of the Ramesseum\r form a double row of vaults, extending from the foot of the hills to\r the border of the cultivated lands. Stone recesses on the roof furnished\r shelter for the watchmen.* The outermost of the village huts stood among\r the nearest tombs. The population which had been gathered together there\r was of a peculiar character, and we can gather but a feeble idea of its\r nature from the surroundings of the cemeteries in our own great cities.\r Death required, in fact, far more attendants among the ancient Egyptians\r than with us. The first service was that of mummification, which\r necessitated numbers of workers for its accomplishment. Some of the\r workshops of the embalmers have been discovered from time to time at\r Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh and Deîr el-Baharî, but we are still in ignorance\r as to their arrangements, and as to the exact nature of the materials\r which they employed. A considerable superficial space was required, for\r the manipulations of the embalmers occupied usually from sixty to eighty\r days, and if we suppose that the average deaths at Thebes amounted to\r fifteen or twenty in the twenty-four hours, they would have to provide\r at the same time for the various degrees of saturation of some twelve to\r fifteen hundred bodies at the least.**\r \r      * The discovery of quantities of ostraca in the ruins of\r      these chambers shows that they served partly for cellars.\r \r      ** I have formed my estimate of fifteen to twenty deaths per\r      day from the mortality of Cairo during the French\r      occupation. This is given by R. Desgenettes, in the\r      _Description de lEgypte_, but only approximately, as many\r      deaths, especially of females, must have been concealed from\r      the authorities; I have, however, made an average from the\r      totals, and applied the rate of mortality thus obtained to\r      ancient Thebes. The same result follows from calculations\r      based on more recent figures, obtained before the great\r      hygienic changes introduced into Cairo by Ismail Pacha, i.e.\r      from August 1, 1858, to July 31, 1859, and from May 24,\r      1865, to May 16, 1866, and for the two years from April 2,\r      1869, to March 21, 1870, and from April 2, 1870, to March\r      21, 1871.\r \r Each of the corpses,moreover, necessitated the employment of at least\r half a dozen workmen to wash it, cut it open, soak it, dry it, and\r apply the usual bandages before placing the amulets upon the canonically\r prescribed places, and using the conventional prayers.\r \r [Illustration: 007.jpg HEAD OF A THEBAN MUMMY]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey.\r \r There was fastened to the breast, immediately below the neck, a stone\r or green porcelain scarab, containing an inscription which was to be\r efficacious in preventing the heart, his heart which came to him from\r his mother, his heart from the time he was upon the earth, from rising\r up and witnessing against the dead man before the tribunal of Osiris.*\r There were placed on his fingers gold or enamelled rings, as talismans\r to secure for him the true voice.**\r \r      * The manipulations and prayers were prescribed in the Book\r      of Embalming.\r \r      ** The prescribed gold ring was often replaced by one of\r      blue or green enamel.\r \r The body becomes at last little more than a skeleton, with a covering of\r yellow skin which accentuates the anatomical, details, but the head, on\r the other hand, still preserves, where the operations have been properly\r conducted, its natural form. The cheeks have fallen in slightly, the\r lips and the fleshy parts of the nose have become thinner and more\r drawn than during life, but the general expression of the face remains\r unaltered.\r \r [Illustration: 008.jpg THE MANUFACTURE AND PAINTING OF THE CARTONNAGE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after Rosellini.\r \r A mask of pitch was placed over the visage to preserve it, above\r which was adjusted first a piece of linen and then a series of bands\r impregnated with resin, which increased the size of the head to twofold\r its ordinary bulk. The trunk and limbs were bound round with a first\r covering of some pliable soft stuff, warm to the touch. Coarsely\r powdered natron was scattered here and there over the body as an\r additional preservative. Packets placed between the legs, the arms and\r the hips, and in the eviscerated abdomen, contained the heart, spleen,\r the dried brain, the hair, and the cuttings of the beard and nails. In\r those days the hair had a special magical virtue: by burning it while\r uttering certain incantations, one might acquire an almost limitless\r power over the person to whom it had belonged. The ernbalmers,\r therefore, took care to place with the mummy such portions of the hair\r as they had been obliged to cut off, so as to remove them out of the way\r of the perverse ingenuity of the sorcerers.\r \r [Illustration: 009.jpg WRAPPING OF THE MUMMY, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE\r MAN OF THE ROLL]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Rosellini.\r \r Over the first covering of the mummy already alluded to, there was\r sometimes placed a strip of papyrus or a long piece of linen, upon which\r the scribe had transcribed selections--both text and pictures--from The\r Book of the going forth by Day: in such cases the roll containing the\r whole work was placed between the legs. The body was further wrapped in\r several bandages, then in a second piece of stuff, then in more bands,\r the whole being finally covered with a shroud of coarse canvas and a\r red linen winding-sheet, sewn together at the back, and kept in place by\r transverse bands disposed at intervals from head to foot. The son of the\r deceased and a man of the roll were present at this lugubrious toilet,\r and recited at the application of each piece a prayer, in which its\r object was defined and its duration secured. Every Egyptian was supposed\r to be acquainted with the formulas, from having learned them during his\r lifetime, by which he was to have restored to him the use of his limbs,\r and be protected from the dangers of the world beyond. These were\r repeated to the dead person, however, for greater security, during the\r process of embalming, and the son of the deceased, or the master of the\r ceremonies, took care to whisper to the mummy the most mysterious parts,\r which no living ear might hear with impunity. The wrappings having\r been completed, the deceased person became aware of his equipment, and\r enjoyed all the privileges of the instructed and fortified Manes. He\r felt himself, both mummy and double, now ready for the tomb.\r \r Egyptian funerals were not like those to which we are accustomed--mute\r ceremonies, in which sorrow is barely expressed by a furtive tear:\r noise, sobbings, and wild gestures were their necessary concomitants.\r Not only was it customary to hire weeping women, who tore their hair,\r filled the air with their lamentations, and simulated by skilful actions\r the depths of despair, but the relatives and friends themselves did not\r shrink from making an outward show of their grief, nor from disturbing\r the equanimity of the passers-by by the immoderate expressions of their\r sorrow. One after another they raised their voices, and uttered some\r expression appropriate to the occasion: To the West, the dwelling of\r Osiris, to the West, thou who wast the best of men, and who always hated\r guile. And the hired weepers answered in chorus: O chief,* as thou\r goest to the West, the gods themselves lament. The funeral _cortege_\r started in the morning from the house of mourning, and proceeded at a\r slow pace to the Nile, amid the clamours of the mourners.\r \r      * The chief is one of the names of Osiris, and is applied\r      naturally to the dead person, who has become an Osiris by\r      virtue of the embalming.\r \r The route was cleared by a number of slaves and retainers. First came\r those who carried cakes and flowers in their hands, followed by others\r bearing jars full of water, bottles of liqueurs, and phials of perfumes;\r then came those who carried painted boxes intended for the provisions\r of the dead man, and for containing the Ushabtiu, or Respondents. The\r succeeding group bore the usual furniture required by the deceased\r to set up house again, coffers for linen, folding and arm chairs,\r state-beds, and sometimes even a caparisoned chariot with its quivers.\r Then came a groom conducting two of his late masters favourite horses,\r who, having accompanied the funeral to the tomb, were brought back\r to their stable. Another detachment, more numerous than the others\r combined, now filed past, bearing the effects of the mummy; first the\r vessels for the libations, then the cases for the Canopic jars, then the\r Canopic jars themselves, the mask of the deceased, coloured half in gold\r and half in blue, arms, sceptres, military batons, necklaces, scarabs,\r vultures with encircling wings worn on the breast at festival-times,\r chains, Respondents, and the human-headed sparrow-hawk, the emblem of\r the soul. Many of these objects were of wood plated with gold, others\r of the same material simply gilt, and others of solid gold, and thus\r calculated to excite the cupidity of the crowd. Offerings came next,\r then a noisy company of female weepers; then a slave, who sprinkled at\r every instant some milk upon the ground as if to lay the dust; then\r a master of the ceremonies, who, the panther skin upon his shoulder,\r asperged the crowd with perfumed water; and behind him comes the hearse.\r \r [Illustration: 012.jpg THE FUNERAL OF HARMHABI]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after a coloured print in Wilkinson.\r      The cut on the following page joins this on the right.\r \r The latter, according to custom, was made in the form of a\r boat--representing the bark of Osiris, with his ark, and two guardians,\r Isis and Nephthys--and was placed upon a sledge, which was drawn by a\r team of oxen and a relay of fellahîn. The sides of the ark were, as\r a rule, formed of movable wooden panels, decorated with pictures and\r inscriptions; sometimes, however, but more rarely, the panels were\r replaced by a covering of embroidered stuff or of soft leather. In\r the latter case the decoration was singularly rich, the figures and\r hieroglyphs being cut out with a knife, and the spaces thus left filled\r in with pieces of coloured leather, which gave the whole an appearance\r of brilliant mosaic-work.*\r \r      * One of these coverings was found in the hiding-place at\r      Deîr el-Baharî; it had belonged to the Princess Isîmkhobiû,\r      whose mummy is now at Gîzeh.\r \r [Illustration: 013.jpg THE FUNERAL OF HABMHABÎ]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the coloured print in\r      Wilkinson. The left side of this design fits on to the right\r      of the preceding cut.\r \r In place of a boat, a shrine of painted wood, also mounted upon a\r sledge, was frequently used. When the ceremony was over, this was left,\r together with the coffin, in the tomb.*\r \r      * I found in the tomb of Sonnozmû two of these sledges with\r      the superstructure in the form of a temple. They are now in\r      the Gîzeh Museum.\r \r The wife and children walked as close to the bier as possible, and\r were followed by the friends of the deceased, dressed in long linen\r garments,* each of them bearing a wand. The ox-driver, while goading his\r beasts, cried out to them: To the West, ye oxen who draw the hearse,\r to the West! Your master comes behind you! To the West, the friends\r repeated; the excellent man lives no longer who loved truth so dearly\r and hated lying!**\r \r      ** The whole of this description is taken from the pictures\r      representing the interment of a certain Harmhabî, who died\r      at Thebes in the time of Thfitmosis IV.\r \r      * These expressions are taken from the inscriptions on the\r      tomb of Rai\r \r [Illustration: 014.jpg THE BOAT CARRYING THE MUMMY]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from pictures in the tomb of\r      Nofirhotpû at Thebes.\r \r This lamentation is neither remarkable for its originality nor for its\r depth of feeling. Sorrow was expressed on such occasions in prescribed\r formulas of always the same import, custom soon enabling each individual\r to compose for himself a repertory of monotonous exclamations of\r condolence, of which the prayer, To the West! formed the basis,\r relieved at intervals by some fresh epithet. The nearest relatives\r of the deceased, however, would find some more sincere expressions of\r grief, and some more touching appeals with which to break in upon the\r commonplaces of the conventional theme. On reaching the bank of the Nile\r the funeral cortege proceeded to embark.*\r \r      * The description of this second part of the funeral\r      arrangements is taken from the tomb of Harmhabî, and\r      especially from that of Nofirhotpû.\r \r [Illustration: 015.jpg THE BOATS CONTAINING THE FEMALE WEEPERS AND THE\r PEOPLE OF THE HOUSEHOLD]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from paintings on the tomb of\r      Nofirhotpû at Thebes.\r \r They blended with their inarticulate cries, and the usual protestations\r and formulas, an eulogy upon the deceased and his virtues, allusions\r to his disposition and deeds, mention of the offices and honours he had\r obtained, and reflections on the uncertainty of human life--the whole\r forming the melancholy dirge which each generation intoned over its\r predecessor, while waiting itself for the same office to be said over it\r in its turn.\r \r The bearers of offerings, friends, and slaves passed over on hired\r barges, whose cabins, covered externally with embroidered stuffs of\r several colours, or with _applique_ leather, looked like the pedestals\r of a monument: crammed together on the boats, they stood upright with\r their faces turned towards the funeral bark. The latter was supposed to\r represent the Noshemît, the mysterious skiff of Abydos, which had been\r used in the obsequies of Osiris of yore.\r \r [Illustration: 016.jpg THE BOATS CONTAINING THE FRIENDS AND THE FUNERARY\r FURNITURE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from paintings on the tomb of\r      Nofirhotpû at Thebes.\r \r It was elegant, light, and slender in shape, and ornamented at bow and\r stern with a lotus-flower of metal, which bent back its head gracefully,\r as if bowed down by its own weight. A temple-shaped shrine stood in\r the middle of the boat, adorned with bouquets of flowers and with\r green palm-branches. The female members of the family of the deceased,\r crouched beside the shrine, poured forth lamentations, while two\r priestesses, representing respectively Isis and Nephthys, took up\r positions behind to protect the body. The boat containing the female\r mourners having taken the funeral barge in tow, the entire flotilla\r pushed out into the stream. This was the solemn moment of the\r ceremony--the moment in which the deceased, torn away from his earthly\r city, was about to set out upon that voyage from which there is no\r return. The crowds assembled on the banks of the river hailed the dead\r with their parting prayers: Mayest thou reach in peace the West from\r Thebes! In peace, in peace towards Abydos, mayest thou descend in peace\r towards Abydos, towards the sea of the West!\r \r [Illustration: 017.jpg A CORNER OF THE THEBAN NECROPOLIS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a stele in the Gîzeh Museum.\r \r This crossing of the Nile was of special significance in regard to\r the future of the soul of the deceased: it represented his pilgrimage\r towards Abydos, to the Mouth of the Cleft which gave him access to\r the other world, and it was for this reason that the name of Abydos is\r associated with that of Thebes in the exclamations of the crowd. The\r voices of the friends replied frequently and mournfully: To the West,\r to the West, the land of the justified! The place which thou lovedst\r weeps and is desolate! Then the female mourners took up the refrain,\r saying: In peace, in peace, to the West! O honourable one, go in peace!\r If it please God, when the day of Eternity shall shine, we shall see\r thee, for behold thou goest to the land which mingles all men together!\r  The widow then adds her note to the concert of lamentations: O my\r brother, O my husband, O my beloved, rest, remain in thy place, do not\r depart from the terrestrial spot where thou art! Alas, thou goest away\r to the ferry-boat in order to cross the stream! O sailors, do not hurry,\r leave him; you, you will return to your homes, but he, he is going away\r to the land of Eternity! O Osirian bark, why hast thou come to take away\r from me him who has left me! The sailors were, of course, deaf to her\r appeals, and the mummy pursued its undisturbed course towards the last\r stage of its mysterious voyage.\r \r The majority of the tombs--those which were distributed over the plain\r or on the nearest spurs of the hill--were constructed on the lines of\r those brick-built pyramids erected on mastabas which were very common\r during the early Theban dynasties. The relative proportions of the parts\r alone were modified: the mastaba, which had gradually been reduced to\r an insignificant base, had now recovered its original height, while the\r pyramid had correspondingly decreased, and was much reduced in size. The\r chapel was constructed within the building, and the mummy-pit was sunk\r to a varying depth below. The tombs ranged along the mountain-side were,\r on the other hand, rock-cut, and similar to those at el-Bersheh and\r Beni-Hasan.\r \r [Illustration: 018.jpg PAINTING IN THE FIFTH TOMB OF THE KINGS TO THE\r RIGHT]\r \r The heads of wealthy families or the nobility naturally did not leave to\r the last moment the construction of a sepulchre worthy of their rank and\r fortune. They prided themselves on having finished their house which is\r in the funeral valley when the morning for the hiding away of their body\r should come. Access to these tombs was by too steep and difficult a\r path to allow of oxen being employed for the transport of the mummy: the\r friends or slaves of the deceased were, therefore, obliged to raise the\r sarcophagus on their shoulders and bear it as best they could to the\r door of the tomb.\r \r [Illustration: 019.jpg THE FAREWELL TO THE MUMMY, AND THE DOUBLE\r RECEIVED BY THE GODDESS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the paintings in the Theban\r      tombs.\r \r The mummy was then placed in an upright position on a heap of sand, with\r its back to the wall and facing the assistants, like the master of some\r new villa who, having been accompanied by his friends to see him take\r possession, turns for a moment on the threshold to take leave of\r them before entering. A sacrifice, an offering, a prayer, and a fresh\r outburst of grief ensued; the mourners redoubled their cries and threw\r themselves upon the ground, the relatives decked the mummy with flowers\r and pressed it to their bared bosoms, kissing it upon the breast and\r knees. I am thy sister, O great one! forsake me not! Is it indeed thy\r will that I should leave thee? If I go away, thou shalt be here alone,\r and is there any one who will be with thee to follow thee? O thou\r who lovedst to jest with me, thou art now silent, thou speakest\r not! Whereupon the mourners again broke out in chorus: Lamentation,\r lamentation! Make, make, make, make lamentation without ceasing as loud\r as can be made. O good traveller, who takest thy way towards the land of\r Eternity, thou hast been torn from us! O thou who hadst so many around\r thee, thou art now in the land which bringest isolation! Thou who\r lovedst to stretch thy limbs in walking, art now fettered, bound,\r swathed! Thou who hadst fine stuffs in abundance, art laid in the linen\r of yesterday! Calm in the midst of the tumult, the priest stood and\r offered the incense and libation with the accustomed words: To thy\r double, Osiris Nofirhotpû, whose voice before the great god is true!\r  This was the signal of departure, and the mummy, carried by two men,\r disappeared within the tomb: the darkness of the other world had laid\r hold of it, never to let it go again.\r \r The chapel was usually divided into two chambers: one, which was of\r greater width than length, ran parallel to the façade; the other, which\r was longer than it was wide, stood at right angles with the former,\r exactly opposite to the entrance. The decoration of these chambers\r took its inspiration from the scheme which prevailed in the time of the\r Memphite dynasties, but besides the usual scenes of agricultural labour,\r hunting, and sacrifice, there were introduced episodes from the public\r life of the deceased, and particularly the minute portrayal of the\r ceremonies connected with his burial.\r \r [Illustration: 021.jpg NICHE IN THE TOMB OF MENNA]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.\r \r These pictorial biographies are always accompanied by detailed\r explanatory inscriptions; every individual endeavoured thus to show\r to the Osirian judges the rank he had enjoyed here upon earth, and to\r obtain in the fields of lalû the place which he claimed to be his due.\r \r The stele was to be found at the far end of the second chamber; it was\r often let in to a niche in the form of a round-headed doorway, or else\r it was replaced by a group of statues, either detached or sculptured in\r the rock itself, representing the occupant, his wives and children, who\r took the place of the supporters of the double, formerly always hidden\r within the serdab. The ceremony of the Opening of the Mouth took\r place in front of the niche on the day of burial, at the moment when the\r deceased, having completed his terrestrial course, entered his new home\r and took possession of it for all eternity. The object of this ceremony\r was, as we know, to counteract the effects of the embalming, and to\r restore activity to the organs of the body whose functions had been\r suspended by death. The man of the roll and his assistants, aided by\r the priests, who represented the children of Horus, once more raised\r the mummy into an upright position upon a heap of sand in the middle of\r the chapel, and celebrated in his behalf the divine mystery instituted\r by Horus for Osiris. They purified it both by ordinary and by red water,\r by the incense of the south and by the alum of the north, in the same\r manner as that in which the statues of the gods were purified at the\r beginning of the temple sacrifices; they then set to work to awake the\r deceased from his sleep: they loosened his shroud and called back the\r double who had escaped from the body at the moment of the death-agony,\r and restored to him the use of his arms and legs. As soon as the\r sacrificial slaughterers had despatched the bull of the south, and cut\r it in pieces, the priest seized the bleeding haunch, and raised it\r to the lips of the mask as if to invite it to eat; but the lips still\r remained closed, and refused to perform their office. The priest then\r touched them with several iron instruments hafted on wooden handles,\r which were supposed to possess the power of unsealing them.\r \r [Illustration: 023a.jpg COFFIN-LID]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by M. de Mertens.\r \r [Illustration: 023b.jpg COFFIN-LID]\r \r The opening once effected, the double became free, and the\r tomb-paintings from thenceforward ceasing to depict the mummy,\r represented the double only. They portrayed it under the form which he\r had on this earth, wearing the civil garb, and fulfilling his ordinary\r functions. The corpse was regarded as merely the larva, to be maintained\r in its integrity in order to ensure survival; but it could be relegated\r without fear to the depths of the bare and naked tomb, there to remain\r until the end of time, if it pleased the gods to preserve it from\r robbers or archaeologists. At the period of the first Theban empire\r the coffins were rectangular wooden chests, made on the models of the\r limestone and granite sarcophagi, and covered with prayers taken from\r the various sacred writings, especially from the Book of the Dead;\r during the second Theban empire, they were modified into an actual\r sheath for the body, following more or less the contour of the human\r figure. This external model of the deceased covered his remains, and\r his figure in relief served as a lid to the coffin. The head was covered\r with the full-dress wig, a tippet of white cambrio half veiled the\r bosom, the petticoat fell in folds about the limbs, the feet were shod\r with sandals, the arms were outstretched or were folded over the breast,\r and the hands clasped various objects--either the _crux ansata_, the\r buckle of the belt, the _tat_, or a garland of flowers. Sometimes, on\r the contrary, the coffin was merely a conventional reproduction of\r the human form. The two feet and legs were joined together, and the\r modelling of the knee, calf, thigh, and stomach was only slightly\r indicated in the wood. Towards the close of the XVIIIth dynasty it was\r the fashion for wealthy persons to have two coffins, one fitting inside\r the other, painted black or white. From the XXth dynasty onwards they\r were coated with a yellowish varnish, and so covered with inscriptions\r and mystic signs that each coffin was a tomb in miniature, and could\r well have done duty as such, and thus meet all the needs of the soul.*\r \r      * The first to summarise the characteristics of the coffins\r      and sarcophagi of the second Theban period was Mariette, but\r      he places the use of the yellow-varnished coffins too late,\r      viz. during the XXIInd dynasty. Examples of them have since\r      been found which incontestably belong to the XXth.\r \r [Illustration: 024.jpg THE MUMMY FACTORY]\r \r Later still, during the XXIst and XXIInd dynasties, these two, or even\r three coffins, were enclosed in a rectangular sarcophagus of thick wood,\r which, surmounted by a semicircular lid, was decorated with pictures and\r hallowed by prayers: four sparrow-hawks, perched on the uprights at the\r corners, watched at the four cardinal points, and protected the body,\r enabling the soul at the same time to move freely within the four houses\r of which the world was composed.\r \r [Illustration: 025.jpg THE PARAPHERNALIA OF A MUMMY OF THE XXth TO THE\r XXIInd DYNASTIES]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Mariette.\r \r The workmen, after having deposited the mummy in its resting-place,\r piled upon the floor of the tomb the canopio jars, the caskets, the\r provisions, the furniture, the bed, and the stools and chairs; the\r Usha-btiu occupied compartments in their allotted boxes, and sometimes\r there would be laid beside them the mummy of a favourite animal--a\r monkey, a dog of some rare breed, or a pet gazelle, whose coffins were\r shaped to their respective outlines, the better to place before the\r deceased the presentment of the living animal.\r \r [Illustration: 026.jpg THE FUNERAL REPAST--MUSIC AND DANCING]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a fragment in the British\r      Museum. The scene representing the funeral repast and its\r      accompanying dances occurs frequently in the Theban tombs.\r \r A few of the principal objects were broken or damaged, in the belief\r that, by thus destroying them, their doubles would go forth and\r accompany the human double, and render him their accustomed services\r during the whole of his posthumous existence; a charm pronounced over\r them bound them indissolubly to his person, and constrained them to obey\r his will. This done, the priest muttered a final prayer, and the masons\r walled up the doorway.\r \r [Illustration: 027.jpg THE COFFIN OF THE FAVOURITE GAZELLE OF\r ISÎMKHOBIU]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-\r      Bey.\r \r The funeral feast now took place with its customary songs and dances.\r The _almehs_ addressed the guests and exhorted them to make good use of\r the passing hour: Be happy for one day! for when you enter your tombs\r you will rest there eternally throughout the length of every day!\r \r Immediately after the repast the friends departed from the tomb, and the\r last link which connected the dead with our world was then broken. The\r sacred harper was called upon to raise the farewell hymn:*\r \r      * The harper is often represented performing this last\r      office. In the tomb of Nofirhotpû, and in many others, the\r      daughters or the relatives of the deceased accompany or even\r      replace the harper; in this case they belonged to a priestly\r      family, and fulfilled the duties of the Female Singers of\r      Amon or some other god.\r \r O instructed mummies, ennead of the gods of the coffin, who listen to\r the praises of this dead man, and who daily extol the virtues of this\r instructed mummy, who is living eternally like a god, ruling in Amentît,\r ye also who shall live in the memory of posterity, all ye who shall\r come and read these hymns inscribed, according to the rites, within\r the tombs, repeat: The greatness of the under-world, what is it? The\r annihilation of the tomb, why is it? It is to conform to the image\r of the land of Eternity, the true country where there is no strife and\r where violence is held in abhorrence, where none attacks his neighbour,\r and where none among our generations who rest within it is rebellious,\r from the time when your race first existed, to the moment when it shall\r become a multitude of multitudes, all going the same way; for instead\r of remaining in this land of Egypt, there is not one but shall leave it,\r and there is said to all who are here below, from the moment of their\r waking to life: Go, prosper safe and sound, to reach the tomb at\r length, a chief among the blessed, and ever mindful in thy heart of the\r day when thou must lie down on the funeral bed! The ancient song\r of Antûf, modified in the course of centuries, was still that which\r expressed most forcibly the melancholy thought paramount in the minds of\r the friends assembled to perform the last rites. The impassibility of\r the chief* is, in truth, the best of fates!\r \r      * Osiris is here designated by the word chief, as I have\r      already pointed out.\r \r [Illustration: 029.jpg ONE OF THE HARPERS OF THE TOMB OF RAMSES III.]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph taken Byjnsinger in\r      1881.\r \r Since the times of the god bodies are created merely to pass away, and\r young generations take their place: Râ rises in the morning, Tûmû lies\r down to rest in the land of the evening, all males generate, the females\r conceive, every nose inhales the air from the morning of their birth\r to the day when they go to their place! Be happy then for one day, O\r man!--May there ever be perfumes and scents for thy nostrils, garlands\r and lotus-flowers for thy shoulders and for the neck of thy beloved\r sister* who sits beside thee! Let there be singing and music before\r thee, and, forgetting all thy sorrows, think only of pleasure until the\r day when thou must enter the country of Marîtsakro, the silent goddess,\r though all the same the heart of the son who loves thee will not cease\r to beat! Be happy for one day, O man!--I have heard related what befell\r our ancestors; their walls are destroyed, their place is no more, they\r are as those who have ceased to live from the time of the god! The walls\r of thy tomb are strong, thou hast planted trees at the edge of thy pond,\r thy soul reposes beneath them and drinks the water; follow that which\r seemeth good to thee as long as thou art on earth, and give bread to him\r who is without land, that thou mayest be well spoken of for evermore.\r Think upon the gods who have lived long ago: their meat offerings\r fall in pieces as if they had been torn by a panther, their loaves are\r defiled with dust, their statues no longer stand upright within the\r temple of Râ, their followers beg for alms! Be happy for one day!\r \r      * Marriages between brothers and sisters in Egypt rendered\r      this word sister the most natural appellation.\r \r Those gone before thee have had their hour of joy, and they have put\r off sadness which shortens the moments until the day when hearts are\r destroyed!--Be mindful, therefore, of the day when thou shalt be taken\r to the country where all men are mingled: none has ever taken thither\r his goods with him, and no one can ever return from it! The grave did\r not, however, mingle all men as impartially as the poet would have us\r believe. The poor and insignificant had merely a place in the common\r pit, which was situated in the centre of the Assassîf,* one of the\r richest funerary quarters of Thebes.\r \r      * There is really only one complete description of a\r      cemetery of the poor, namely, that given by A. Rhind.\r      Mariette caused extensive excavations to be made by Gabet\r      and Vassalli, 1859-1862, in the Assassif, near the spot\r      worked by Rhind, and the objects found are now in the Gîzeh\r      Museum, but the accounts of the work are among his\r      unpublished papers, vassalli assures me that he sometimes\r      found the mummies piled one on another to the depth of sixty\r      bodies, and even then he did not reach the lowest of the\r      pile. The hurried excavations which I made in 1882 and 1884,\r      appeared to confirm these statements of Rhind and Vassalli.\r \r Yawning trenches stood ever open there, ready to receive their prey;\r the rites were hurriedly performed, and the grave-diggers covered the\r mummies of the days burial with a little sand, out of which we receive\r them intact, sometimes isolated, sometimes in groups of twos or threes,\r showing that they had not even been placed in regular layers. Some\r are wrapped only in bandages of coarse linen, and have been consigned\r without further covering to the soil, while others have been bound round\r with palm-leaves laid side by side, so as to form a sort of primitive\r basket. The class above the poorest people were buried in rough-hewn\r wooden boxes, smaller at the feet than towards the head, and devoid of\r any inscription or painting. Many have been placed in any coffin that\r came to hand, with a total indifference as to suitability of size;\r others lie in a badly made bier, made up of the fragments of one or more\r older biers. None of them possessed any funerary furniture, except the\r tools of his trade, a thin pair of leather shoes, sandals of cardboard\r or plaited reeds, rings of terra-cotta or bronze, bracelets or necklets\r of a single row of blue beads, statuettes of divinities, mystic eyes,\r scarabs, and, above all, cords tied round the neck, arms, limbs, or\r waist, to keep off, by their mystic knots, all malign influences.\r \r The whole population of the necropolis made their living out of the\r dead. This was true of all ranks of society, headed by the sacerdotal\r colleges of the royal chapels,* and followed by the priestly bodies, to\r whom was entrusted the care of the tombs in the various sections,\r but the most influential of whom confined their attentions to the old\r burying-ground, Isît-mâît, the True Place.**\r \r      * We find on several monuments the names of persons\r      belonging to these sacerdotal bodies, priests of Ahmosis I.,\r      priests of Thûtmosis I., of Thût-mosis II., of Amenôthes\r      II., and of Seti I.\r \r      ** The persons connected with the True Place were for a\r      long time considered as magistrates, and the True Place as\r      a tribunal.\r \r It was their duty to keep up the monuments of the kings, and also of\r private individuals, to clean the tombs, to visit the funerary chambers,\r to note the condition of their occupants, and, if necessary, repair\r the damage done by time, and to provide on certain days the offerings\r prescribed by custom, or by clauses in the contract drawn up between\r the family of the deceased and the religious authorities. The titles of\r these officials indicated how humble was their position in relation to\r the deified ancestors in whose service they were employed; they called\r themselves the Servants of the True Place, and their chiefs the\r Superiors of the Servants, but all the while they were people of\r considerable importance, being rich, well educated, and respected in\r their own quarter of the town.\r \r [Illustration: 032.jpg PAINTINGS AT THE END OF THE HALL OF THE FIFTH\r THE TOMB]\r \r They professed to have a special devotion for Amenôthes I. and his\r mother, Nofrîtari, who, after five or six centuries of continuous\r homage, had come to be considered as the patrons of Khafîtnîbûs, but\r this devotion was not to the depreciation of other sovereigns. It is\r true that the officials were not always clear as to the identity of the\r royal remains of which they had the care, and they were known to have\r changed one of their queens or princesses into a king or some royal\r prince.*\r \r      * Thus Queen Ahhotpû I., whom the servant Anhûrkhâû knew\r      to be a woman, is transformed into a King Ahhotpû in the\r      tomb of Khâbokhnît.\r \r [Illustration: AMENOTHES III. AT LUXOR]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Gayet.\r \r They were surrounded by a whole host of lesser\r functionaries--bricklayers, masons, labourers, exorcists, scribes (who\r wrote out pious formulae for poor people, or copied the Books of the\r going forth by day for the mummies), weavers, cabinet-makers, and\r goldsmiths. The sculptors and the painters were grouped into guilds;*\r many of them spent their days in the tombs they were decorating, while\r others had their workshops above-ground, probably very like those of our\r modern monumental masons.\r \r      * We gather this from the inscriptions which give us the\r      various titles of the sculptors, draughtsmen, or workmen,\r      but I have been unable to make out the respective positions\r      held by these different persons.\r \r They kept at the disposal of their needy customers an assortment of\r ready-made statues and stelæ, votive tablets to Osiris, Anubis, and\r other Theban gods and goddesses, singly or combined. The name of the\r deceased and the enumeration of the members of his family were left\r blank, and were inserted after purchase in the spaces reserved for the\r purpose.*\r \r      * I succeeded in collecting at the Boulak Museum a\r      considerable number of these unfinished statues and stelæ,\r      coming from the workshops of the necropolis.\r \r These artisans made the greater part of their livelihood by means of\r these epitaphs, and the majority thought only of selling as many of them\r as they could; some few, however, devoted themselves to work of a higher\r kind. Sculpture had reached a high degree of development under the\r Thûtmoses and the Ramses, and the art of depicting scenes in bas-relief\r had been brought to a perfection hitherto unknown. This will be easily\r seen by comparing the pictures in the old mastabas, such as those of Ti\r or Phtahhotpû, with the finest parts of the temples of Qurneh, Abydos,\r Karnak, Deîr el-Baharî, or with the scenes in the tombs of Seti I. and\r Ramses II., or those of private individuals such as Hûi. The modelling\r is firm and refined, showing a skill in the use of the chisel and an\r elegance of outline which have never been surpassed: the Amenôthes III.\r of Luxor and the Khâmhâît of Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh might serve for models\r in our own schools of the highest types which Egyptian art could produce\r at its best in this particular branch. The drawing is freer than in\r earlier examples, the action is more natural, the composition more\r studied, and the perspective less wild. We feel that the artist handled\r his subject _con amore_. He spared no trouble in sketching out\r his designs and in making studies from nature, and, as papyrus was\r expensive, he drew rough drafts, or made notes of his impressions on the\r flat chips of limestone with which the workshops were strewn.\r \r [Illustration: 035.jpg KHÂMHAÎT]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. de Mertens.\r \r Nothing at that date could rival these sketches for boldness of\r conception and freedom in execution, whether it were in the portrayal of\r the majestic gait of a king or the agility of an acrobat. Of the latter\r we have an example in the Turin Museum. The girl is nude, with the\r exception of a tightly fitting belt about her hips, and she is throwing\r herself backwards with so natural a motion, that we are almost tempted\r to expect her to turn a somersault and fall once more into position with\r her heels together.\r \r [Illustration: 026.jpg SKETCH OF A FEMALE ACROBAT]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Petrie.\r \r The unfinished figures on the tomb of Seti I. shows with what a steady\r hand the clever draughtsman could sketch out his subjects. The head from\r the nape of the neck round to the throat is described by a single line,\r and the contour of the shoulders is marked by another. The form of the\r body is traced by two undulating lines, while the arms and legs are\r respectively outlined by two others. The articles of apparel and\r ornaments, sketched rapidly at first, had to be gone over again by the\r sculptor, who worked out the smallest details. One might almost count\r the tresses of the hair, while the folds of the dress and the enamels of\r the girdle and bracelets are minutely chiselled.\r \r [Illustration: BAS-RELIEF OF SETI I., SHOWING CORRECTIONS MADE BY THE\r SCULPTOR]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from photographs by Insinger and\r      Daniel Héron.\r \r When the draughtsman had finished his picture from the sketch which he\r had made, or when he had enlarged it from a smaller drawing, the master\r of the studio would go over it again, marking here and there in red the\r defective points, to which the sculptor gave his attention when working\r the subject out on the wall. If he happened to make a mistake in\r executing it, he corrected it as well as he was able by filling up with\r stucco or hard cement the portions to be remodelled, and by starting to\r work again upon the fresh surface. This cement has fallen out in some\r cases, and reveals to our eyes to-day the marks of the underlying\r chiselling. There are, for example, two profiles of Seti I. on one of\r the bas-reliefs of the hypostyle hall at Karnak, one faintly outlined,\r and the other standing fully out from the surface of the stone. The\r sense of the picturesque was making itself felt, and artists were\r no longer to be excused for neglecting architectural details, the\r configuration of the country, the drawing of rare plants, and, in fact,\r all those accessories which had been previously omitted altogether or\r merely indicated. The necessity of covering such vast surfaces as the\r pylons offered had accustomed them to arrange the various scenes of one\r and the same action in a more natural and intimate connexion than their\r predecessors could possibly have done. In these scenes the Pharaoh\r naturally played the chief part, but in place of choosing for treatment\r merely one or other important action of the monarch calculated\r to exhibit his courage, the artist endeavoured to portray all the\r successive incidents in his campaigns, in the same manner as the early\r Italian painters were accustomed to depict, one after the other, and on\r the same canvas, all the events of the same legend. The details of these\r gigantic compositions may sometimes appear childish to us, and we may\r frequently be at a loss in determining the relations of the parts, yet\r the whole is full of movement, and, although mutilated, gives us even\r yet the impression which would have been made upon us by the turmoil of\r a battle in those distant days.\r \r The sculptor of statues for a long time past was not a whit less skilful\r than the artist who executed bas-reliefs. The sculptor was doubtless\r often obliged to give enormous proportions to the figure of the king, to\r prevent his being overshadowed by the mass of buildings among which the\r statue was to appear; but this necessity of exaggerating the human form\r did not destroy in the artist that sense of proportion and that skilful\r handling of the chisel which are so strikingly displayed in the sitting\r scribe or in the princess at Meîdûm; it merely trained him to mark out\r deftly the principal lines, and to calculate the volume and dimensions\r of these gigantic granite figures of some fifty to sixty-five feet high,\r with as great confidence and skill as he would have employed upon any\r statue of ordinary dimensions which might be entrusted to him.\r The colossal statues at Abu-Simbel and Thebes still witness to the\r incomparable skill of the Theban sculptors in the difficult art of\r imagining and executing superhuman types. The decadence of Egyptian art\r did not begin until the time of Ramses III., but its downward progress\r was rapid, and the statues of the Ramesside period are of little or no\r artistic value. The form of these figures is poor, the technique crude,\r and the expression of the faces mean and commonplace. They betray the\r hand of a mechanical workman who, while still in the possession of the\r instruments of his trade, can infuse no new life into the traditions of\r the schools, nor break away from them altogether.\r \r [Illustration: 040.jpg THE KNEELING SCRIBE AT TURIN]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Petrie; the\r      scribe bears upon his right shoulder, perhaps tattooed, the\r      human image of the god Amon-Râ, whose animal emblem he\r      embraces.\r \r We must look, not to the royal studios, but to the workshops connected\r with the necropolis, if we want to find statues of half life-size\r displaying intelligent workmanship, all of which we might be tempted to\r refer to the XVIIIth dynasty if the inscriptions upon them did not fix\r their date some two or three centuries later. An example of them may be\r seen at Turin in the kneeling scribe embracing a ram-headed altar:\r the face is youthful, and has an expression at once so gentle and\r intelligent that we are constrained to overlook the imperfections in the\r bust and legs of the figure. Specimens of this kind are not numerous,\r and their rarity is easily accounted for. The multitude of priests,\r soldiers, workmen, and small middle-class people who made up the bulk of\r the Theban population had aspirations for a luxury little commensurate\r with their means, and the tombs of such people are, therefore, full\r of objects which simulate a character they do not possess, and are\r deceptive to the eye: such were the statuettes made of wood, substituted\r from economical motives instead of the limestone or sandstone statues\r usually provided as supporters for the double.\r \r [Illustration: 041a.jpg YOUNG GIRL IN THE TURING MUSEUM]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Petrie.\r \r [Illustration: 041b.jpg THE LADY NEHAI]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. de Mertens.\r      Enamelled eyes, according to a common custom, were inserted\r      in the sockets, but have disappeared.\r \r The funerary sculptors had acquired a perfect mastery of the kind of\r art needed for people of small means, and we find among the medley of\r commonplace objects which encumber the tomb they decorated, examples of\r artistic works of undoubted excellence, such as the ladies Naî and Tûî\r now in the Louvre, the lady Nehaî now at Berlin, and the naked child at\r Turin. The lady Tûî in her lifetime had been one of the singing-women of\r Amon. She is clad in a tight-fitting robe, which accentuates the\r contour of the breasts and hips without coarseness: her right arm falls\r gracefully alongside her body, while her left, bent across her chest,\r thrusts into her bosom a kind of magic whip, which was the sign of her\r profession. The artist was not able to avoid a certain heaviness in the\r treatment of her hair, and the careful execution of the whole work was\r not without a degree of harshness, but by dint of scraping and polishing\r the wood he succeeded in softening the outline, and removing from the\r figure every sharp point. The lady Nehaî is smarter and more graceful,\r in her close-fitting garment and her mantle thrown over the left elbow;\r and the artist has given her a more alert pose and resolute air than we\r find in the stiff carriage of her contemporary Tûî. The little girl in\r the Turin Museum is a looser work, but where could one find a better\r example of the lithe delicacy of the young Egyptian maiden of eight or\r ten years old? We may see her counterpart to-day among the young Nubian\r girls of the cataract, before they are obliged to wear clothes; there is\r the same thin chest, the same undeveloped hips, the same meagre thighs,\r and the same demeanour, at once innocent and audacious. Other statuettes\r represent matrons, some in tight garments, and with their hair closely\r confined, others without any garment whatever.\r \r [Illustration: 043a.jpg a soldier]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. de Mertens.\r \r [Illustration: 043b.jpg STATUE IN THE TURIN MUSEUM]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Petrie.\r \r The Turin example is that of a lady who seems proud of her large\r ear-rings, and brings one of them into prominence, either to show it\r off or to satisfy herself that the jewel becomes her: her head is\r square-shaped, the shoulders narrow, the chest puny, the pose of the\r arm stiff and awkward, but the eyes have such a joyful openness, and her\r smile such a self-satisfied expression, that one readily over looks the\r other defects of the statue. In this collection of miniature figures\r examples of men are not wanting, and there are instances of old\r soldiers, officials, guardians of temples, and priests proudly executing\r their office in their distinctive panther skins. Three individuals in\r the Gîzeh were contemporaries, or almost so, of the young girl of the\r Turin Museum. They are dressed in rich costumes, to which they have,\r doubtless, a just claim; for one of them, Hori, surnamed Râ, rejoiced in\r the favour of the Pharaoh, and must therefore have exercised some\r court function. They seem to step forth with a measured pace and firm\r demeanour, the body well thrown back and the head erect, their\r faces displaying something of cruelty and cunning. An officer, whose\r retirement from service is now spent in the Louvre, is dressed in a\r semi-civil costume, with a light wig, a closely fitting smock-frock\r with shirt-sleeves, and a loin-cloth tied tightly round the hips and\r descending halfway down the thigh, to which is applied a piece of stuff\r kilted lengthwise, projecting in front. A colleague of his, now in the\r Berlin Museum, still maintains possession of his official baton, and is\r arrayed in his striped petticoat, his bracelets and gorget of gold.\r A priest in the Louvre holds before him, grasped by both hands, the\r insignia of Amon-Ra--a rams head, surmounted by the solar disk, and\r inserted on the top of a thick handle; another, who has been relegated\r to Turin, appears to be placed between two long staves, each surmounted\r by an idol, and, to judge from his attitude, seems to have no small idea\r of his own beauty and importance. The Egyptians were an observant\r people and inclined to satire, and I have a shrewd suspicion that the\r sculptors, in giving to such statuettes this character of childlike\r vanity, yielded to the temptation to be merry at the expense of their\r model.\r \r The smelters and engravers in metal occupied in relation to the\r sculptors a somewhat exalted position. Bronze had for a long time been\r employed in funerary furniture, and _ushabtiu_ (respondents),* amulets,\r and images of the gods, as well as of mortals, were cast in this metal.\r Many of these tiny figures form charming examples of enamel-work, and\r are distinguished not only by the gracefulness of the, modelling, but\r also by the brilliance of the superimposed glaze; but the majority of\r them were purely commercial articles, manufactured by the hundred from\r the same models, and possibly cast, for centuries, from the same moulds\r for the edification of the devout and of pilgrims.\r \r      * Bronze _respondents_ are somewhat rare, and most of those\r      which are to be found among the dealers are counterfeit. The\r      Gîzeh Museum possesses two examples at least of indisputable\r      authenticity; both of these belong to the XXth dynasty.\r \r [Illustration: 045.jpg FUNERARY CASKET IN THE TURING MUSEUM]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.\r \r [Illustration: 046.jpg SHRINE IN THE TURIN MUSEUM]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Lanzone.\r \r We ought not, therefore, to be surprised if they are lacking in\r originality; they are no more to be distinguished from each other than\r the hundreds of coloured statuettes which one may find on the stalls of\r modern dealers in religious statuary.\r \r [Illustration: 046b.jpg The Lady Taksûhît]\r \r      From a bronze in the Museum at Athens\r \r [Illustration: 046b.jpg-text]\r \r Here and there among the multitude we may light upon examples showing\r a marked individuality: the statuette of the lady Takûshit, which now\r forms one of the ornaments of the museum at Athens, is an instance. She\r stands erect, one foot in advance, her right arm hanging at her side,\r her left pressed against her bosom; she is arrayed in a short dress\r embroidered over with religious scenes, and wears upon her ankles\r and wrists rings of value. A wig with stiff-looking locks, regularly\r arranged in rows, covers her head. The details of the drapery and the\r ornaments are incised on the surface of the bronze, and heightened\r with a thread of silver. The face is evidently a portrait, and is that\r apparently of a woman of mature age, but the body, according to the\r tradition of the Egyptian schools of art, is that of a young girl,\r lithe, firm, and elastic. The alloy contains gold, and the warm and\r softened lights reflected from it blend most happily and harmoniously\r with the white lines of the designs. The joiners occupied, after the\r workers in bronze, an important position in relation to the necropolis,\r and the greater part of the furniture which they executed for the\r mummies of persons of high rank was remarkable for its painting and\r carpentry-work. Some articles of their manufacture were intended for\r religious use--such as those shrines, mounted upon sledges, on which the\r image of the god was placed, to whom prayers were made for the deceased;\r others served for the household needs of the mummy, and, to distinguish\r these, there are to be seen upon their sides religious and funereal\r pictures, offerings to the two deceased parents, sacrifices to a god or\r goddess, and incidents in the Osirian life. The funerary beds consisted,\r like those intended for the living, of a rectangular framework, placed\r upon four feet of equal height, although there are rare examples in\r which the supports are so arranged as to give a gentle slope to the\r structure. The fancy which actuated the joiner in making such beds\r supposed that two benevolent lions had, of their own free will,\r stretched out their bodies to form the two sides of the couch, the\r muzzles constituting the pillow, while the tails were curled up under\r the feet of the sleeper. Many of the heads given to the lions are so\r noble and expressive, that they will well bear comparison with the\r granite statues of these animals which Amenôthes III. dedicated in his\r temple at Soleb. The other trades depended upon the proportion of their\r members to the rest of the community for the estimation in which they\r were held. The masons, stone-cutters, and common labourers furnished\r the most important contingent; among these ought also to be reckoned\r the royal servants--of whose functions we should have been at a loss\r to guess the importance, if contemporary documents had not made it\r clear--fishermen, hunters, laundresses, wood-cutters, gardeners, and\r water-carriers.*\r \r      * The Cailliaud ostracon, which contains a receipt given to\r      some fishermen, was found near Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh, and\r      consequently belonged to the fishermen of the necropolis.\r      There is a question as to the water-carriers of the Khirû in\r      the hieratic registers of Turin, also as to the washers of\r      clothes, wood-cutters, gardeners and workers in the\r      vineyard.\r \r [Illustration: 048.jpg THE SWALLOW-GODDESS FROM THE THEBAN NECROPOLIS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Lanzone.\r \r Without reckoning the constant libations needed for the gods and the\r deceased, the workshops required a large quantity of drinking water for\r the men engaged in them. In every gang of workmen, even in the present\r day, two or three men are set apart to provide drinking-water for the\r rest; in some arid places, indeed, at a distance from the river, such\r as the Valley of the Kings, as many water-carriers are required as there\r are workmen. To the trades just mentioned must be added the low-caste\r crowd depending oh the burials of the rich, the acrobats, female\r mourners, dancers and musicians. The majority of the female corporations\r were distinguished by the infamous character of their manners, and\r prostitution among them had come to be associated with the service of\r the god.*\r \r      * The heroine of the erotic papyrus of Turin bears the title\r      of Singing-woman of Amon, and the illustrations indicate\r      her profession so clearly and so expressively, that no\r      details of her sayings and doings are wanting.\r \r [Illustration: 049.jpg THE GODDESS MABÎTSAKBO]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Lanzone.\r \r There was no education for all this mass of people, and their religion\r was of a meagre character. They worshipped the official deities, Amon,\r Mût, Isis, and Hâthor, and such deceased Pharaohs as Amenôthes I.\r and Nofrîtari, but they had also their own Pantheon, in which animals\r predominated--such as the goose of Amon, and his ram Pa-rahaninofir,\r the good player on the horn, the hippopotamus, the cat, the chicken,\r the swallow, and especially reptiles. Death was personified by a great\r viper, the queen of the West, known by the name Marîtsakro, the friend\r of silence. Three heads, or the single head of a woman, attached to the\r one body, were assigned to it. It was supposed to dwell in the mountain\r opposite Karnak, which fact gave to it, as well as to the necropolis\r itself, the two epithets of Khafîtnîbûs and Ta-tahnît, that is, The\r Summit.*\r \r      * The abundance of the monuments of Marîtsakro found at\r      Sheikh Abd el-Gurneh, inclines me to believe that her\r      sanctuary was situated in the neighbourhood of the temple of\r      Uazmosû, but there was also on the top of the hill another\r      sanctuary which would equally satisfy the name Ta-tahnît.\r \r Its chapel was situated at the foot of the hill of Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh,\r but its sacred serpents crawled and wriggled through the necropolis,\r working miracles and effecting the cure of the most dangerous maladies.\r The faithful were accustomed to dedicate to them, in payment of their\r vows, stelas, or slabs of roughly hewn stone, with inscriptions\r which witnessed to a deep gratitude. Hearken! I, from the time of my\r appearance on earth, I was a Servant of the True Place, Nofirâbû, a\r stupid ignorant person, who knew not good from evil, and I committed\r sin against The Summit. She punished me, and I was in her hand day and\r night. I lay groaning on my couch like a woman in childbed, and I made\r supplication to the air, but it did not come to me, for I was hunted\r down by The Summit of the West, the brave one among all the gods and all\r the goddesses of the city; so I would say to all the miserable sinners\r among the people of the necropolis: Give heed to The Summit, for there\r is a lion in The Summit, and she strikes as strikes a spell-casting\r Lion, and she pursues him who sins against her! I invoked then my\r mistress, and I felt that she flew to me like a pleasant breeze;\r she placed herself upon me, and this made me recognise her hand, and\r appeased she returned to me, and she delivered me from suffering, for\r she is my life, The Summit of the West, when she is appeased, and she\r ought to be invoked! There were many sinners, we may believe, among\r that ignorant and superstitious population, but the governors of Thebes\r did not put their confidence in the local deities alone to keep them\r within bounds, and to prevent their evil deeds; commissioners, with the\r help of a detachment of Mazaîû, were an additional means of conducting\r them into the right way. They had, in this respect, a hard work to\r accomplish, for every day brought with it its contingent of crimes,\r which they had to follow up, and secure the punishment of the authors.\r Nsisûamon came to inform them that the workman Nakhtummaût and his\r companions had stolen into his house, and robbed him of three large\r loaves, eight cakes, and some pastry; they had also drunk a jar of beer,\r and poured out from pure malice the oil which they could not carry\r away with them. Panîbi had met the wife of a comrade alone near an\r out-of-the-way tomb, and had taken advantage of her notwithstanding her\r cries; this, moreover, was not the first offence of the culprit, for\r several young girls had previously been victims of his brutality, and\r had not ventured up to this time to complain of him on account of the\r terror with which he inspired the neighbourhood. Crimes against the dead\r were always common; every penniless fellow knew what quantities of gold\r and jewels had been entombed with the departed, and these treasures,\r scattered around them at only a few feet from the surface of the ground,\r presented to them a constant temptation to which they often succumbed.\r Some were not disposed to have accomplices, while others associated\r together, and, having purchased at a serious cost the connivance of the\r custodians, set boldly to work on tombs both recent and ancient. Not\r content with stealing the funerary furniture, which they disposed of to\r the undertakers, they stripped the mummies also, and smashed the\r bodies in their efforts to secure the jewels; then, putting the remains\r together again, they rearranged the mummies afresh so cleverly that\r they can no longer be distinguished by their outward appearance from the\r originals, and the first wrappings must be removed before the fraud can\r be discovered. From time to time one of these rogues would allow himself\r to be taken for the purpose of denouncing his comrades, and avenging\r himself for the injustice of which he was the victim in the division\r of the spoil; he was laid hold of by the Mazaîû, and brought before the\r tribunal of justice. The lands situated on the left bank of the\r Nile belonged partly to the king and partly to the god Amon, and any\r infraction of the law in regard to the necropolis was almost certain\r to come within the jurisdiction of one or other of them. The commission\r appointed, therefore, to determine the damage done in any case, included\r in many instances the high priest or his delegates, as well as the\r officers of the Pharaoh. The office of this commission was to examine\r into the state of the tombs, to interrogate the witnesses and the\r accused, applying the torture if necessary: when they had got at the\r facts, the tribunal of the notables condemned to impalement some half\r a dozen of the poor wretches, and caused some score of others to be\r whipped.* But, when two or three months had elapsed, the remembrance of\r the punishment began to die away, and the depredations began afresh. The\r low rate of wages occasioned, at fixed periods, outbursts of discontent\r and trouble which ended in actual disturbances. The rations allowed to\r each workman, and given to him at the beginning of each month, would\r possibly have been sufficient for himself and his family, but, owing to\r the usual lack of foresight in the Egyptian, they were often consumed\r long before the time fixed, and the pinch soon began to be felt. The\r workmen, demoralised by their involuntary abstinence, were not slow to\r turn to the overseer; We are perishing of hunger, and there are still\r eighteen days before the next month. The latter was prodigal of fair\r speeches, but as his words were rarely accompanied by deeds, the\r workmen would not listen to him; they stopped work, left the workshop in\r turbulent crowds, ran with noisy demonstrations to some public place to\r hold a meeting--perhaps the nearest monument, at the gate of the temple\r of Thûtmosis III.,** behind the chapel of Mînephtah,*** or in the court\r of that of Seti I.\r \r      * This is how I translate a fairly common expression, which\r      means literally, to be put on the wood. Spiegelberg sees in\r      this only a method of administering torture.\r \r      ** Perhaps the chapel of Uazmôsû, or possibly the free space\r      before the temple of Deîr el-Baharî.\r \r      *** The site of this chapel was discovered by Prof. Petrie\r      in the spring of 1896. It had previously been supposed to be\r      a temple of Amenôthes III.\r \r Their overseers followed them; the police commissioners of the locality,\r the Mazaîû, and the scribes mingled with them and addressed themselves\r to some of the leaders with whom they might be acquainted. But these\r would not at first give them a hearing. We will not return, they would\r say to the peacemakers; make it clear to your superiors down below\r there. It must have been manifest that from their point of view their\r complaints were well founded, and the official, who afterwards gave an\r account of the affair to the authorities, was persuaded of this. We\r went to hear them, and they spoke true words to us. For the most part\r these strikes had no other consequence than a prolonged stoppage of\r work, until the distribution of rations at the beginning of the next\r month gave the malcontents courage to return to their tasks. Attempts\r were made to prevent the recurrence of these troubles by changing\r the method and time of payments. These were reduced to an interval of\r fifteen days, and at length, indeed, to one of eight. The result was\r very much the same as before: the workman, paid more frequently, did not\r on that account become more prudent, and the hours of labour lost did\r not decrease. The individual man, if he had had nobody to consider but\r himself, might have put up with the hardships of his situation, but\r there were almost always wife and children or sisters concerned, who\r clamoured for bread in their hunger, and all the while the storehouses\r of the temples or those of the state close by were filled to overflowing\r with durrah, barley, and wheat.*\r \r      * Khonsu, for example, excites his comrades to pillage the\r      storehouses of the gate.\r \r The temptation to break open the doors and to help themselves in the\r present necessity must have been keenly felt. Some bold spirits among\r the strikers, having set out together, scaled the two or three boundary\r walls by which the granaries were protected, but having reached this\r position their hearts, failed them, and they contented themselves with\r sending to the chief custodian an eloquent pleader, to lay before him\r their very humble request: We are come, urged by famine, urged by\r thirst, having no more linen, no more oil, no more fish, no more\r vegetables. Send to Pharaoh, our master, send to the king, our lord,\r that he may provide us with the necessaries of life. If one of them,\r with less self-restraint, was so carried away as to let drop an oath,\r which was a capital offence, saying, By Amon! by the sovereign, whose\r anger is death! if he asked to be taken before a magistrate in order\r that he might reiterate there his complaint, the others interceded for\r him, and begged that he might escape the punishment fixed by the law\r for blasphemy; the scribe, good fellow as he was, closed his ears to the\r oath, and, if it were in his power, made a beginning of satisfying their\r demands by drawing upon the excess of past months to such an extent as\r would pacify them for some days, and by paying them a supplemental wage\r in the name of the Pharaoh. They cried out loudly: Shall there not be\r served out to us corn in excess of that which has been distributed to\r us; if not we will not stir from this spot?\r \r At length the end of the month arrived, and they all appeared together\r before the magistrates, when they said: Let the scribe, Khâmoîsît,\r who is accountable, be sent for! He was thereupon brought before the\r notables of the town, and they said to him: See to the corn which thou\r hast received, and give some of it to the people of the necropolis.\r  Pmontunîboîsît was then sent for, and rations of wheat were given to\r us daily. Famine was not caused only by the thriftlessness of the\r multitude: administrators of all ranks did not hesitate to appropriate,\r each one according to his position, a portion of the means entrusted\r to them for the maintenance of their subordinates, and the latter often\r received only instalments of what was due to them. The culprits often\r escaped from their difficulties by either laying hold of half a dozen\r of their brawling victims, or by yielding to them a proportion of\r their ill-gotten gains, before a rumour of the outbreak could reach\r head-quarters. It happened from time to time, however, when the\r complaints against them were either too serious or too frequent, that\r they were deprived of their functions, cited before the tribunals, and\r condemned. What took place at Thebes was repeated with some variations\r in each of the other large cities. Corruption, theft, and extortion had\r prevailed among the officials from time immemorial, and the most active\r kings alone were able to repress these abuses, or confine them within\r narrow limits; as soon as discipline became relaxed, however, they began\r to appear again, and we have no more convincing proof of the state of\r decadence into which Thebes had fallen towards the middle of the XXth\r dynasty, than the audacity of the crimes committed in the necropolis\r during the reigns of the successors of Ramses III.\r \r The priesthood of Amon alone displayed any vigour and enjoyed any\r prosperity in the general decline. After the victory of the god over the\r heretic kings no one dared to dispute his supremacy, and the Ramessides\r displayed a devout humility before him and his ministers. Henceforward\r he became united to Râ in a definite manner, and his authority not only\r extended over the whole of the land of Egypt, but over all the countries\r also which were brought within her influence; so that while Pharaoh\r continued to be the greatest of kings, Pharaohs god held a position\r of undivided supremacy among the deities. He was the chief of the two\r Bnneads, the Heliopolitan and the Hermopolitan, and displayed for\r the latter a special affection; for the vague character of its eight\r secondary deities only served to accentuate the position of the ninth\r and principal divinity with whose primacy that of Amon was identified.\r It was more easy to attribute to Amon the entire work of creation when\r Shû, Sibû, Osiris, and Sit had been excluded--the deities whom the\r theologians of Heliopolis had been accustomed to associate with the\r demiurge; and in the hymns which they sang at his solemn festivals they\r did not hesitate to ascribe to him all the acts which the priests of\r former times had assigned to the Ennead collectively. He made earth,\r silver, gold,--the true lapis at his good pleasure.--He brought forth\r the herbs for the cattle, the plants upon which men live.--He made to\r live the fish of the river,--the birds which hover in the air,--giving\r air to those which are in the egg.--He animates the insects,--he makes\r to live the small birds, the reptiles, and the gnats as well.--He\r provides food for the rat in his hole,--supports the bird upon the\r branch.--May he be blessed for all this, he who is alone, but with many\r hands. Men spring from his two eyes, and quickly do they lose\r their breath while acclaiming him--Egyptians and Libyans, Negroes and\r Asiatics: Hail to thee! they all say; praise to thee because thou\r dwellest amongst us!--Obeisances before thee because thou createst\r us!--Thou art blessed by every living thing,--thou hast worshippers in\r every place,--in the highest of the heavens, in all the breadth of\r the earth,--in the depths of the seas.--The gods bow before thy\r Majesty,--magnifying the souls which form them,--rejoicing at meeting\r those who have begotten them,--they say to thee: Go in peace,--father\r of the fathers of all the gods,--who suspended the heaven, levelled the\r earth;--creator of beings, maker of things,--sovereign king, chief of\r the gods,--we adore thy souls, because thou hast made us,--we lavish\r offerings upon thee, because thou hast given us birth,--we shower\r benedictions upon thee, because thou dwellest among us. We have here\r the same ideas as those which predominate in the hymns addressed to\r Atonû,* and in the prayers directed to Phtah, the Nile, Shû, and the\r Sun-god of Heliopolis at the same period.\r \r      * Breasted points out the decisive influence exercised by\r      the solar hymns of Amenôthes IV. on the development of the\r      solar ideas contained in the hymns to Amon put forth or re-\r      edited in the XXIIIrd dynasty.\r \r The idea of a single god, lord and maker of all things, continued to\r prevail more and more throughout Egypt--not, indeed, among the lower\r classes who persisted in the worship of their genii and their animals,\r but among the royal family, the priests, the nobles, and people of\r culture. The latter believed that the Sun-god had at length absorbed\r all the various beings who had been manifested in the feudal divinities:\r these, in fact, had surrendered their original characteristics in order\r to become forms of the Sun, Amon as well as the others--and the new\r belief displayed itself in magnifying the solar deity, but the solar\r deity united with the Theban Amon, that is, Amon-Râ. The omnipotence of\r this one god did not, however, exclude a belief in the existence of his\r compeers; the theologians thought all the while that the beings to whom\r ancient generations had accorded a complete independence in respect of\r their rivals were nothing more than emanations from one supreme being.\r If local pride forced them to apply to this single deity the designation\r customarily used in their city--Phtah at Memphis, Anhûri-Shû at Thinis,\r Khnûmû in the neighbourhood of the first cataract--they were quite\r willing to allow, at the same time, that these appellations were but\r various masks for one face. Phtah, Hâpi, Khnûmû, Râ,--all the gods, in\r fact,--were blended with each other, and formed but one deity--a unique\r existence, multiple in his names, and mighty according to the importance\r of the city in which he was worshipped. Hence Amon, lord of the capital\r and patron of the dynasty, having more partisans, enjoyed more respect,\r and, in a word, felt himself possessed of more claims to be the sole god\r of Egypt than his brethren, who could not claim so many worshippers. He\r did not at the outset arrogate to himself the same empire over the dead\r as he exercised over the living; he had delegated his functions in this\r respect to a goddess, Marîtsakro, for whom the poorer inhabitants of the\r left bank entertained a persistent devotion. She was a kind of Isis or\r hospitable Hathor, whose subjects in the other world adapted themselves\r to the nebulous and dreary existence provided for their disembodied\r doubles. The Osirian and solar doctrines were afterwards blended\r together in this local mythology, and from the XIth dynasty onwards the\r Theban nobility had adopted, along with the ceremonies in use in the\r Memphite period, the Heliopolitan beliefs concerning the wanderings\r of the soul in the west, its embarkation on the solar ship, and its\r resting-places in the fields of Ialû. The rock-tombs of the XVIIIth\r dynasty demonstrate that the Thebans had then no different concept of\r their life beyond the world from that entertained by the inhabitants\r of the most ancient cities: they ascribed to that existence the same\r inconsistent medley of contradictory ideas, from which each one might\r select what pleased him best--either repose in a well-provisioned tomb,\r or a dwelling close to Osiris in the middle of a calm and agreeable\r paradise, or voyages with Râ around the world.*\r \r      * The Pyramid texts are found for the most part in the tombs\r      of Nofirû and Harhôtpû; the texts of the Book of the Dead\r      are met with on the Theban coffins of the same period.\r \r [Illustration: 060.jpg DECORATED WRAPPINGS OF A MUMMY]\r \r The fusion of Râ and Amon, and the predominance of the solar idea which\r arose from it, forced the theologians to examine more closely these\r inconsistent notions, and to eliminate from them anything which might be\r out of harmony with the new views. The devout servant of Amon, desirous\r of keeping in constant touch with his god both here and in the other\r would, could not imagine a happier future for his soul than in its going\r forth in the fulness of light by day, and taking refuge by night on\r the very bark which carried the object of his worship through the thick\r darkness of, Hades. To this end he endeavoured to collect the formulae\r which would enable him to attain to this supreme happiness, and also\r inform him concerning the hidden mysteries of that obscure half of the\r world in which the sun dwelt between daylight and daylight, teaching him\r also how to make friends and supporters of the benevolent genii, and how\r to avoid or defeat the monsters whom he would encounter. The best\r known of the books relating to these mysteries contained a geographical\r description of the future world as it was described by the Theban\r priests towards the end of the Ramesside period; it was, in fact, an\r itinerary in which was depicted each separate region of the underworld,\r with its gates, buildings, and inhabitants.*\r \r      * The monumental text of this book is found sculptured on a\r      certain number of the tombs of the Theban kings. It was\r      first translated into English by Birch, then into French by\r      Dévéria, and by Maspero.\r \r The account of it given by the Egyptian theologians did not exhibit much\r inventive genius. They had started with the theory that the sun, after\r setting exactly west of Thebes, rose again due east of the city, and\r they therefore placed in the dark hemisphere all the regions of the\r universe which lay to the north of those two points of the compass. The\r first stage of the suns journey, after disappearing below the horizon,\r coincided with the period of twilight; the orb travelled along the open\r sky, diminishing the brightness of his fires as he climbed northward,\r and did not actually enter the underworld till he reached Abydos,\r close to the spot where, at the Mouth of the Cleft, the souls of the\r faithful awaited him. As soon as he had received them into his boat,\r he plunged into the tunnel which there pierces the mountains, and the\r cities through which he first passed between Abydos and the Fayûm were\r known as the Osirian fiefs. He continued his journey through them for\r the space of two hours, receiving the homage of the inhabitants, and\r putting such of the shades on shore as were predestined by their special\r devotion for the Osiris of Abydos and his associates, Horus and Anubis,\r to establish themselves in this territory. Beyond Heracleopolis, he\r entered the domains of the Memphite gods, the land of Sokaris, and\r this probably was the most perilous moment of his journey.\r \r [Illustration: 062.jpg ONE OF THE MYSTERIOUS BOOKS OF AMON]\r \r The feudatories of Phtah were gathered together in grottoes, connected\r by a labyrinth of narrow passages through which even the most fully\r initiated were scarcely able to find their way; the luminous boat,\r instead of venturing within these catacombs, passed above them by\r mysterious tracks. The crew were unable to catch a glimpse of the\r sovereign through whose realm they journeyed, and they in like manner\r were invisible to him; he could only hear the voices of the divine\r sailors, and he answered them from the depth of the darkness. Two hours\r were spent in this obscure passage, after which navigation became easier\r as the vessel entered the nomes subject to the Osirises of the Delta:\r four consecutive hours of sailing brought the bark from the province in\r which the four principal bodies of the god slept to that in which\r his four souls kept watch, and, as it passed, it illuminated the eight\r circles reserved for men and kings who worshipped the god of Mendes.\r From the tenth hour onwards it directed its course due south, and passed\r through the Aûgàrît, the place of fire and abysmal waters to which the\r Heliopolitans consigned the souls of the impious; then finally quitting\r the tunnel, it soared up in the east with the first blush of dawn. Each\r of the ordinary dead was landed at that particular hour of the twelve,\r which belonged to the god of his choice or of his native town. Left to\r dwell there they suffered no absolute torment, but languished in the\r darkness in a kind of painful torpor, from which condition the approach\r of the bark alone was able to rouse them. They hailed its daily coming\r with acclamations, and felt new life during the hour in which its rays\r fell on them, breaking out into lamentations as the bark passed away and\r the light disappeared with it. The souls who were devotees of the sun\r escaped this melancholy existence; they escorted the god, reduced though\r he was to a mummied corpse, on his nightly cruise, and were piloted by\r him safe and sound to meet the first streaks of the new day. As the\r boat issued from the mountain in the morning between the two trees which\r flanked the gate of the east, these souls had their choice of several\r ways of spending the day on which they were about to enter. They might\r join their risen god in his course through the hours of light, and\r assist him in combating Apophis and his accomplices, plunging again at\r night into Hades without having even for a moment quitted his side.\r \r [Illustration: 066.jpg THE ENTRANCE TO A ROYAL TOMB]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph, by Beato, of the\r      tomb of Ramses IV.\r \r [Illustration: 066b.jpg ONE OF THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT]\r \r They might, on the other hand, leave him and once more enter the world\r of the living, settling themselves where they would, but always by\r preference in the tombs where their bodies awaited them, and where they\r could enjoy the wealth which had been accumulated there: they might walk\r within their garden, and sit beneath the trees they had planted; they\r could enjoy the open air beside the pond they had dug, and breathe the\r gentle north breeze on its banks after the midday heat, until the time\r when the returning evening obliged them to repair once more to Abydos,\r and re-embark with the god in order to pass the anxious vigils of the\r night under his protection. Thus from the earliest period of Egyptian\r history the life beyond the tomb was an eclectic one, made up of a\r series of earthly enjoyments combined together.\r \r The Pharaohs had enrolled themselves instinctively among the most ardent\r votaries of this complex doctrine. Their relationship to the sun made\r its adoption a duty, and its profession was originally, perhaps, one of\r the privileges of their position. Râ invited them on board because they\r were his children, subsequently extending this favour to those whom\r they should deem worthy to be associated with them, and thus become\r companions of the ancient deceased kings of Upper and Lower Egypt.*\r \r      * This is apparently what we gather from the picture\r      inserted in chapter xvii. of the Book of the Dead, where\r      we see the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt guiding the divine\r      bark and the deceased with them.\r \r The idea which the Egyptians thus formed of the other world, and of the\r life of the initiated within it, reacted gradually on their concept of\r the tomb and of its befitting decoration. They began to consider the\r entrances to the pyramid, and its internal passages and chambers, as a\r conventional representation of the gates, passages, and halls of Hades\r itself; when the pyramid passed out of fashion, and they had replaced\r it by a tomb cut in the rock in one or other of the branches of the Bab\r el-Moluk valley, the plan of construction which they chose was an exact\r copy of that employed by the Memphites and earlier Thebans, and they\r hollowed out for themselves in the mountain-side a burying-place on the\r same lines as those formerly employed within the pyramidal structure.\r The relative positions of the tunnelled tombs along the valley were not\r determined by any order of rank or of succession to the throne; each\r Pharaoh after Ramses I. set to work on that part of the rock where the\r character of the stone favoured his purpose, and displayed so little\r respect for his predecessors, that the workmen, after having tunnelled\r a gallery, were often obliged to abandon it altogether, or to change the\r direction of their excavations so as to avoid piercing a neighbouring\r tomb. The architects design was usually a mere project which could be\r modified at will, and, which he did not feel bound to carry out with\r fidelity; the actual measurements of the tomb of Ramses IV. are almost\r everywhere at variance with the numbers and arrangement of the working\r drawing of it which has been preserved to us in a papyrus. The general\r disposition of the royal tombs, however, is far from being complicated;\r we have at the entrance the rectangular door, usually surmounted by the\r sun, represented by a yellow disk, before which the sovereign kneels\r with his hands raised in the posture of adoration; this gave access to\r a passage sloping gently downwards, and broken here and there by a level\r landing and steps, leading to a first chamber of varying amplitude, at\r the further end of which a second passage opened which descended to one\r or more apartments, the last of which, contained the coffin. The oldest\r rock-tombs present some noteworthy exceptions to this plan, particularly\r those of Seti I. and Ramses III.; but from the time of Ramses IV., there\r is no difference to be remarked in them except in the degree of finish\r of the wall-paintings or in the length of the passages. The shortest of\r the latter extends some fifty-two feet into the rock, while the longest\r never exceeds three hundred and ninety feet. The same artifices\r which had been used by the pyramid-builders to defeat the designs of\r robbers--false mummy-pits, painted and sculptured walls built across\r passages, stairs concealed under a movable stone in the corner of a\r chamber--were also employed by the Theban engineers. The decoration of\r the walls was suggested, as in earlier times, by the needs of the royal\r soul, with this difference--that the Thebans set themselves to render\r visible to his eyes by paintings that which the Memphites had been\r content to present to his intelligence in writing, so that the Pharaoh\r could now see what his ancestors had been able merely to read on the\r walls of their tombs. Where the inscribed texts in the burial-chamber\r of Unas state that Unas, incarnate in the Sun, and thus representing\r Osiris, sails over the waters on high or glides into the Elysian fields,\r the sculptured or painted scenes in the interior of the Theban catacombs\r display to the eye Ramses occupying the place of the god in the solar\r bark and in the fields of laid. Where the walls of Unas bear only the\r prayers recited over the mummy for the opening of his mouth, for the\r restoration of the use of his limbs, for his clothing, perfuming, and\r nourishment, we see depicted on those of Seti I. or Ramses IV. the\r mummies of these kings and the statues of their doubles in the hands\r of the priests, who are portrayed in the performance of these various\r offices. The starry ceilings of the pyramids reproduce the aspect of the\r sky, but without giving the names of the stars: on the ceilings of some\r of the Ramesside rock-tombs, on the other hand, the constellations are\r represented, each with its proper figure, while astronomical tables give\r the position of the heavenly bodies at intervals of fifteen days, so\r that the soul could tell at a glance into what region of the firmament\r the course of the bark would bring him each night. In the earlier\r Ramesside tombs, under Seti I. and Ramses II., the execution of these\r subjects shows evidence of a care and skill which are quite marvellous,\r and both figures and hieroglyphics betray the hand of accomplished\r artists. But in the tomb of Ramses III. the work has already begun to\r show signs of inferiority, and the majority of the scenes are coloured\r in a very summary fashion; a raw yellow predominates, and the tones of\r the reds and blues remind us of a childs first efforts at painting.\r This decline is even more marked under the succeeding Ramessides; the\r drawing has deteriorated, the tints have become more and more crude,\r and the latest paintings seem but a lamentable caricature of the earlier\r ones.\r \r The courtiers and all those connected with the worship of\r Amon-Râ--priests, prophets, singers, and functionaries connected with\r the necropolis--shared the same belief with regard to the future world\r as their sovereign, and they carried their faith in the suns power\r to the point of identifying themselves with him after death, and of\r substituting the name of Râ for that of Osiris; they either did not\r venture, however, to go further than this, or were unable to introduce\r into their tombs all that we find in the Bab el-Moluk. They confined\r themselves to writing briefly on their own coffins, or confiding to\r the mummies of their fellow-believers, in addition to the Book of the\r Dead, a copy of the Book of knowing what there is in Hades, or of\r some other mystic writing which was in harmony with their creed. Hastily\r prepared copies of these were sold by unscrupulous scribes, often badly\r written and almost always incomplete, in which were hurriedly set\r down haphazard the episodes of the course of the sun with explanatory\r illustrations. The representations of the gods in them are but little\r better than caricatures, the text is full of faults and scarcely\r decipherable, and it is at times difficult to recognize the\r correspondence of the scenes and prayers with those in the royal tombs.\r Although Amon had become the supreme god, at least for this class of\r the initiated, he was by no means the sole deity worshipped by the\r Egyptians: the other divinities previously associated with him still\r held their own beside him, or were further defined and invested with\r a more decided personality. The goddess regarded as his partner was at\r first represented as childless, in spite of the name of Maût or Mût--the\r mother--by which she was invoked, and Amon was supposed to have adopted\r Montû, the god of Hermonthis, in order to complete his triad. Montû,\r however, formerly the sovereign of the Theban plain, and lord over Amon\r himself, was of too exalted a rank to play the inferior part of a divine\r son.\r \r [Illustration: 074.jpg KHONSÛ* AND TEMPLE OF KHONSÛ**.]\r \r      * Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bronze statuette in the\r      Gizeh Museum.\r \r      ** Drawn by Thuillier: A is the pylon, B the court, C the\r      hypostyle hall, E the passage isolating the sanctuary, D the\r      sanctuary, F the opisthodomos with its usual chambers.\r \r The priests were, therefore, obliged to fall back upon a personage\r of lesser importance, named Khonsû, who up to that period had been\r relegated to an obscure position in the celestial hierarchy. How they\r came to identify him with the moon, and subsequently with Osiris and\r Thot, is as yet unexplained,* but the assimilation had taken place\r before the XIXth dynasty drew to its close. Khonsû, thus honoured, soon\r became a favourite deity with both the people and the upper classes,\r at first merely supplementing Montû, but finally supplanting him in the\r third place of the Triad. From the time of Sesostris onwards, Theban\r dogma acknowledged him alone side by side with Amon-Râ and Mût the\r divine mother.\r \r      * It is possible that this assimilation originated in the\r      fact that Khonsû is derived from the verb khonsû, to\r      navigate: Khonsû would thus have been he who crossed the\r      heavens in his bark--that is, the moon-god.\r \r [Illustration: 075.jpg THE TEMPLE OF KHONSÛ AT KARNAK]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.\r \r It was now incumbent on the Pharaoh to erect to this newly made\r favourite a temple whose size and magnificence should be worthy of the\r rank to which his votaries had exalted him. To this end, Ramses III.\r chose a suitable site to the south of the hypostyle hall of Karnak,\r close to a corner of the enclosing wall, and there laid the foundations\r of a temple which his successors took nearly a century to finish.*\r \r      * The proof that the temple was founded by Ramses III. is\r      furnished by the inscriptions of the sanctuary and the\r      surrounding chambers.\r \r Its proportions are by no means perfect, the sculpture is wanting in\r refinement, the painting is coarse, and the masonry was so faulty, that\r it was found necessary in several places to cover it with a coat of\r stucco before the bas-reliefs could be carved on the walls; yet, in\r spite of all this, its general arrangement is so fine, that it may\r well be regarded, in preference to other more graceful or magnificent\r buildings, as the typical temple of the Theban period. It is divided\r into two parts, separated from each other by a solid wall. In the centre\r of the smaller of these is placed the Holy of Holies, which opens\r at both ends into a passage ten feet in width, isolating it from the\r surrounding buildings. To the right and left of the sanctuary are dark\r chambers, and behind it is a hall supported by four columns, into which\r open seven small apartments. This formed the dwelling-place of the god\r and his compeers. The sanctuary communicates, by means of two doors\r placed in the southern wall, with a hypostyle hall of greater width\r than depth, divided by its pillars into a nave and two aisles. The\r four columns of the nave are twenty-three feet in height, and have\r bell-shaped capitals, while those of the aisles, two on either side, are\r eighteen feet high, and are crowned with lotiform capitals.\r \r [Illustration: 077.jpg THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE OF KHONSÛ]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.\r \r The roof of the nave was thus five feet higher than those of the aisles,\r and in the clear storey thus formed, stone gratings, similar to those\r in the temple of Amon, admitted light to the building. The courtyard,\r surrounded by a fine colonnade of two rows of columns, was square, and\r was entered by four side posterns in addition to the open gateway at the\r end placed between two quadrangular towers.\r \r [Illustration: 078.jpg THE COLONNADE BUILT BY THÛTMOSIS III]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger and\r      Daniel Héron.\r \r This pylon measures 104 feet in length, and is 32 feet 6 inches wide,\r by 58 feet high. It contains no internal chambers, but merely a narrow\r staircase which leads to the top of the doorway, and thence to the\r summit of the towers. Four long angular grooves run up the façade of the\r towers to a height of about twenty feet from the ground, and are in\r the same line with a similar number of square holes which pierce the\r thickness of the building higher up. In these grooves were placed\r Venetian masts, made of poles spliced together and held in their place\r by means of hooks and wooden stays which projected from the four holes;\r these masts were to carry at their tops pennons of various colours.\r Such was the temple of Khonsû, and the majority of the great Theban\r buildings--at Luxor, Qurneh, and Bamesseum, or Medinet-Uabu--were\r constructed on similar lines. Even in their half-ruined condition there\r is something oppressive and uncanny in their appearance. The gods\r loved to shroud themselves in mystery, and, therefore, the plan of\r the building was so arranged as to render the transition almost\r imperceptible from the blinding sunlight outside to the darkness of\r their retreat within. In the courtyard, we are still surrounded by vast\r spaces to which air and light have free access. The hypostyle hall,\r however, is pervaded by an appropriate twilight, the sanctuary is veiled\r in still deeper darkness, while in the chambers beyond reigns an almost\r perpetual night. The effect produced by this gradation of obscurity\r was intensified by constructional artifices. The different parts of the\r building are not all on the same ground-level, the pavement rising as\r the sanctuary is approached, and the rise is concealed by a few steps\r placed at intervals. The difference of level in the temple of Khonsû is\r not more than five feet three inches, but it is combined with a still\r more considerable lowering of the height of the roof. From the pylon\r to the wall at the further end the height decreases as we go on; the\r peristyle is more lofty than the hypostyle hall, this again is higher\r than the sanctuary and the hall of columns, and the chamber beyond it\r drops still further in altitude.*\r \r      * This is the law of progressive diminution of heights of\r      Perrot-Chipiez.\r \r Karnak is an exception to this rule; this temple had in the course of\r centuries undergone so many restorations and additions, that it formed a\r collection of buildings rather than a single edifice. It might have\r been regarded, as early as the close of the Theban empire, as a kind of\r museum, in which every century and every period of art, from the XIIth\r dynasty downwards, had left its distinctive mark.*\r \r      * A on the plan denotes the XIIth dynasty temple; B is the\r      great hypostyle hall of Seti I. and Ramses II.; C the temple\r      of Ramses III.\r \r [Illustration: 081.jpg THE TEMPLE OF AMON AT KARNAK]\r \r All the resources of architecture had been brought into requisition\r during this period to vary, at the will of each sovereign, the\r arrangement and the general effect of the component parts. Columns with\r sixteen sides stand in the vicinity of square pillars, and lotiform\r capitals alternate with those of the bell-shape; attempts were even made\r to introduce new types altogether. The architect who built at the back\r of the sanctuary what is now known as the colonnade of Thûtmosis\r III., attempted to invert the bell-shaped capital; the bell was turned\r downwards, and the neck attached to the plinth, while the mouth rested\r on the top of the shaft. This awkward arrangement did not meet with\r favour, for we find it nowhere repeated; other artists, however, with\r better taste, sought at this time to apply the flowers symbolical of\r Upper and Lower Egypt to the decorations of the shafts. In front of the\r sanctuary of Karnak two pillars are still standing which have on them\r in relief representations respectively of the fullblown lotus and the\r papyrus. A building composed of so many incongruous elements required\r frequent restoration--a wall which had been undermined by water needed\r strengthening, a pylon displaying cracks claimed attention, some\r unsafe colonnade, or a colossus which had been injured by the fall of\r a cornice, required shoring up--so that no sooner had the corvée for\r repairs completed their work in one part, than they had to begin again\r elsewhere.\r \r [Illustration: 082.jpg THE TWO STELE-PILLARS AT KARNAK]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.\r \r The revenues of Amon must, indeed, have been enormous to have borne the\r continual drain occasioned by restoration, and the resources of the god\r would soon have been exhausted had not foreign wars continued to furnish\r him during several centuries with all or more than he needed.\r \r The gods had suffered severely in the troublous times which had followed\r the reign of Seti II., and it required all the generosity of Ramses III.\r to compensate them for the losses they had sustained during the anarchy\r under Arisû. The spoil taken from the Libyans, from the Peoples of the\r Sea, and from the Hittites had flowed into the sacred treasuries, while\r the able administration of the sovereign had done the rest, so that on\r the accession of Ramses IV. the temples were in a more prosperous state\r than ever.* They held as their own property 169 towns, nine of which\r were in Syria and Ethiopia; they possessed 113,433 slaves of both sexes,\r 493,386 head of cattle, 1,071,780 arurse of land, 514 vineyards and\r orchards, 88 barks and sea-going vessels, 336 kilograms of gold both in\r ingots and wrought, 2,993,964 grammes of silver, besides quantities of\r copper and precious stones, and hundreds of storehouses in which they\r kept corn, oil, wine, honey, and preserved meats--the produce of their\r domains. Two examples will suffice to show the extent of this latter\r item: the live geese reached the number of 680,714, and the salt or\r smoked fish that of 494,800.** Amon claimed the giant share of this\r enormous total, and three-fourths of it or more were reserved for his\r use, namely---86,486 slaves, 421,362 head of cattle, 898,168 _arurse_\r of cornland, 433 vineyards and orchards, and 56 Egyptian towns. The nine\r foreign towns all belonged to him, and one of them contained the temple\r in which he was worshipped by the Syrians whenever they came to pay\r their tribute to the kings representatives: it was but just that his\r patrimony should surpass that of his compeers, since the conquering\r Pharaohs owed their success to him, who, without the co-operation of the\r other feudal deities, had lavished victories upon them.\r \r      * The donations of Ramses III., or rather the total of the\r      donations made to the gods by the predecessors of that\r      Pharaoh, and confirmed and augmented by him, are enumerated\r      at length in the _Great Harris Papyrus_.\r \r      ** An abridgement of these donations occupies seven large\r      plates in the _Great Harris Papyrus_.\r \r His domain was at least five times more considerable than that of Râ of\r Heliopolis, and ten times greater than that of the Memphite Phtah, and\r yet of old, in the earlier times of history, Râ and Phtah were reckoned\r the wealthiest of the Egyptian gods. It is easy to understand the\r influence which a god thus endowed with the goods of this world\r exercised over men in an age when the national wars had the same\r consequences for the immortals as for their worshippers, and when the\r defeat of a people was regarded as a proof of the inferiority of\r its patron gods. The most victorious divinity became necessarily the\r wealthiest, before whom all other deities bowed, and whom they, as well\r as their subjects, were obliged to serve.\r \r So powerful a god as Amon had but few obstacles to surmount before\r becoming the national deity; indeed, he was practically the foremost of\r the gods during the Ramesside period, and was generally acknowledged\r as Egypts representative by all foreign nations.* His priests shared in\r the prestige he enjoyed, and their influence in state affairs increased\r proportionately with his power.\r \r      * From the XVIIIth dynasty, at least, the first prophet of\r      Amon had taken the precedence of the high priests of\r      Heliopolis and Memphis, as is proved by the position he\r      occupies in the Egyptian hierarchy in the _Hood Papyrus_.\r \r The chief of their hierarchy, however, did not bear the high titles\r which in ancient times distinguished those of Memphis and Heliopolis; he\r was content with the humble appellation of first prophet of Amon. He\r had for several generations been nominated by the sovereign, but he was\r generally chosen from the families attached hereditarily or otherwise\r to the temple of Karnak, and must previously have passed through every\r grade of the priestly hierarchy. Those who aspired to this honour had to\r graduate as divine fathers; this was the first step in the initiation,\r and one at which many were content to remain, but the more ambitious or\r favoured advanced by successive stages to the dignity of third, and then\r of second, prophet before attaining to the highest rank.*\r \r      * What we know on this subject has been brought to light\r      mainly by the inscriptions on the statue of Baûkûni-Khonsû\r      at Munich, published and commented on by Dévéria, and by\r      Lauth. The cursus honorum of Ramâ shows us that he was first\r      third, then second prophet of Amon, before being raised to\r      the pontificate in the reign of Mînephtah.\r \r The Pharaohs of the XIXth dynasty jealously supervised the promotions\r made in the Theban temples, and saw that none was elected except him who\r was devoted to their interests--such as, for example, Baûkûni-khonsû\r and Unnofri under Ramses II. Baûkûni-khonsû distinguished himself by his\r administrative qualities; if he did not actually make the plans for the\r hypostyle hall at Karnak, he appears at least to have superintended\r its execution and decoration. He finished the great pylon, erected the\r obelisks and gateways, built the _bari_ or vessel of the god, and found\r a further field for his activity on the opposite bank of the Nile, where\r he helped to complete both the chapel at Qurneh and also the Ramesseum.\r Ramses II. had always been able to make his authority felt by the high\r priests who succeeded Baûkûni-khonsû, but the Pharaohs who followed him\r did not hold the reins with such a strong hand. As early as the reigns\r of Mînephtah and Seti II. the first prophets, Raî and Ramâ, claimed the\r right of building at Karnak for their own purposes, and inscribed on the\r walls long inscriptions in which their own panegyrics took precedence\r of that of the sovereign; they even aspired to a religious hegemony, and\r declared themselves to be the chief of all the prophets of the gods\r of the South and North. We do not know what became of them during the\r usurpation of Arisû, but Nakhtû-ramses, son of Miribastît, who filled\r the office during the reign of Ramses III., revived these ambitious\r projects as soon as the state of Egypt appeared to favour them. The\r king, however pious he might be, was not inclined to yield up any of his\r authority, even though it were to the earthly delegate of the divinity\r whom he reverenced before all others; the sons of the Pharaoh were,\r however, more accommodating, and Nakhtû-ramses played his part so well\r that he succeeded in obtaining from them the reversion of the high\r priesthood for his son Amenôthes. The priestly office, from having been\r elective, was by this stroke suddenly made hereditary in the family.\r The kings preserved, it is true, the privilege of confirming the new\r appointment, and the nominee was not considered properly qualified until\r he had received his investiture from the sovereign.*\r \r      * This is proved by the Maunier stele, now in the Louvre; it\r      is there related how the high priest Manakh-pirrî received\r      his investiture from the Tanite king.\r \r Practically the Pharaohs lost the power of choosing one among the sons\r of the deceased pontiff; they were forced to enthrone the eldest of his\r survivors, and legalise his accession by their approbation, even when\r they would have preferred another. It was thus that a dynasty of vassal\r High Priests came to be established at Thebes side by side with the\r royal dynasty of the Pharaohs.\r \r The new priestly dynasty was not long in making its power felt in\r Thebes. Nakhtû-ramses and Amenôthes lived to a great age--from the reign\r of Ramses III. to that of Ramses X., at the least; they witnessed the\r accession of nine successive Pharaohs, and the unusual length of their\r pontificates no doubt increased the already extraordinary prestige which\r they enjoyed throughout the length and breadth of Egypt. It seemed as if\r the god delighted to prolong the lives of his representatives beyond the\r ordinary limits, while shortening those of the temporal sovereigns. When\r the reigns of the Pharaohs began once more to reach their normal length,\r the authority of Amenôthes had become so firmly established that no\r human power could withstand it, and the later Ramessides were merely a\r set of puppet kings who were ruled by him and his successors. Not only\r was there a cessation of foreign expeditions, but the Delta, Memphis,\r and Ethiopia were alike neglected, and the only activity displayed\r by these Pharaohs, as far as we can gather from their monuments, was\r confined to the service of Amon and Khonsû at Thebes. The lack of energy\r and independence in these sovereigns may not, however, be altogether\r attributable to their feebleness of character; it is possible that they\r would gladly have entered on a career of conquest had they possessed\r the means. It is always a perilous matter to allow the resources of\r a country to fall into the hands of a priesthood, and to place its\r military forces at the same time in the hands of the chief religious\r authority. The warrior Pharaohs had always had at their disposal the\r spoils obtained from foreign nations to make up the deficit which their\r constant gifts to the temples were making in the treasury. The sons\r of Ramses III., on the other hand, had suspended all military efforts,\r without, however, lessening their lavish gifts to the gods, and they\r must, in the absence of the spoils of war, have drawn to a considerable\r extent upon the ordinary resources of the country; their successors\r therefore found the treasury impoverished, and they would have been\r entirely at a loss for money had they attempted to renew the campaigns\r or continue the architectural work of their forefathers. The priests of\r Amon had not as yet suffered materially from this diminution of revenue,\r for they possessed property throughout the length and breadth of Egypt,\r but they were obliged to restrict their expenditure, and employ the sums\r formerly used for the enlarging of the temples on the maintenance\r of their own body. Meanwhile public works had been almost everywhere\r suspended; administrative discipline became relaxed, and disturbances,\r with which the police were unable to cope, were increasing in all the\r important towns. Nothing is more indicative of the state to which Egypt\r was reduced, under the combined influence of the priesthood and the\r Ramessides, than the thefts and pillaging of which the Theban necropolis\r was then the daily scene. The robbers no longer confined themselves\r to plundering the tombs of private persons; they attacked the royal\r burying-places, and their depredations were carried on for years before\r they were discovered. In the reign of Ramses IX., an inquiry, set on\r foot by Amenôthes, revealed the fact that the tomb of Sovkûmsaûf I. and\r his wife, Queen Nûbk-hâs, had been rifled, that those of Amenôthes I.\r and of Antuf IV. had been entered by tunnelling, and that some dozen\r other royal tombs in the cemetery of Drah abul Neggah were threatened.*\r \r      * The principal part of this inquiry constitutes the _Abbott\r      Papyrus_, acquired and published by the British Museum,\r      first examined and made the subject of study by Birch,\r      translated simultaneously into French by Maspero and by\r      Chabas, into German by Lauth and by Erman. Other papyri\r      relate to the same or similar occurrences, such as the Salt\r      and Amherst Papyri published by Chabas, and also the\r      Liverpool Papyri, of which we possess merely scattered\r      notices in the writings of Goodwin, and particularly in\r      those of Spiegelberg.\r \r The severe means taken to suppress the evil were not, however,\r successful; the pillagings soon began afresh, and the reigns of the last\r three Ramessides between the robbers and the authorities, were marked by\r a struggle in which the latter did not always come off triumphant.\r \r [Illustration: 089.jpg RAMSES IX.]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Lepsius.\r \r A system of repeated inspections secured the valley of Biban el-Moluk\r from marauders,* but elsewhere the measures of defence employed were\r unavailing, and the necropolis was given over to pillage, although both\r Amenôthes and Hrihor had used every effort to protect it.\r \r      * Graffiti which are evidences of these inspections have\r      been drawn on the walls of several royal tombs by the\r      inspectors. Others have been found on several of the coffins\r      discovered at Deîr el-Baharî, e.g. on those of Seti I. and\r      Ramses II.; the most ancient belong to the pontificate of\r      Hrihor, others belong to the XXIst dynasty.\r \r Hrihor appears to have succeeded immediately after Amenôthes, and\r his accession to the pontificate gave his family a still more exalted\r position in the country. As his wife Nozmit was of royal blood, he\r assumed titles and functions to which his father and grandfather\r had made no claim. He became the Royal Son of Ethiopia and\r commander-in-chief of the national and foreign troops; he engraved his\r name upon the monuments he decorated, side by side with that of Ramses\r XII.; in short, he possessed all the characteristics of a Pharaoh except\r the crown and the royal protocol. A century scarcely had elapsed since\r the abdication of Ramses III., and now Thebes and the whole of Egypt\r owned two masters: one the embodiment of the ancient line, but a mere\r nominal king; the other the representative of Amon, and the actual ruler\r of the country.\r \r What then happened when the last Ramses who bore the kingly title was\r gathered to his fathers? The royal lists record the accession after his\r death of a new dynasty of Tanitic origin, whose founder was Nsbindidi\r or Smendes; but, on the other hand, we gather from the Theban monuments\r that the crown was seized by Hrihor, who reigned over the southern\r provinces contemporaneously with Smendes. Hrihor boldly assumed as\r prenomen his title of First Prophet of Amon, and his authority was\r acknowledged by Ethiopia, over which he was viceroy, as well as by the\r nomes forming the temporal domain of the high priests. The latter had\r acquired gradually, either by marriage or inheritance, fresh territory\r for the god, in the lands of the princes of Nekhabît, Kop-tos, Akhmîm,\r and Abydos, besides the domains of some half-dozen feudal houses\r who, from force of circumstances, had become sacerdotal families; the\r extinction of the direct line of Ramessides now secured the High\r Priests the possession of Thebes itself, and of all the lands within the\r southern provinces which were the appanage of the crown.\r \r [Illustration: 091.jpg HRIHOR]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Champollion.\r \r They thus, in one way or another, became the exclusive masters of the\r southern half of the Nile valley, from Elephantine to Siut; beyond Siut\r also they had managed to acquire suzerainty over the town of Khobît, and\r the territory belonging to it formed an isolated border province in the\r midst of the independent baronies.*\r \r      * The extent of the principality of Thebes under the high\r      priests has been determined by means of the sacerdotal\r      titles of the Theban princesses.\r \r The representative of the dynasty reigning at Tanis held the remainder\r of Egypt from Shit to the Mediterranean--the half belonging to the\r Memphite Phtah and the Helio-politan Râ, as opposed to that assigned to\r Anion. The origin of this Tanite sovereign is uncertain, but it would\r appear that he was of more exalted rank than his rival in the south. The\r official chronicling of events was marked by the years of his reign, and\r the chief acts of the government were carried out in his name even in\r the Thebaid.* Repeated inundations had caused the ruin of part of the\r temple of Karnak, and it was by the order and under the auspices of this\r prince that all the resources of the country were employed to accomplish\r the much-needed restoration.**\r \r      * I have pointed out that the years of the reign mentioned\r      in the inscriptions of the high priests and the kings of the\r      sacerdotal line must be attributed to their suzerains, the\r      kings of Tanis. Hrihor alone seems to have been an\r      exception, since to him are attributed the dates inscribed\r      in the name of the King Siamon: M. Daressy, however, will\r      not admit this, and asserts that this Siamon was a Tanite\r      sovereign who must not be identified with Hrihor, and must\r      be placed at least two or three generations later than the\r      last of the Ramessides.\r \r      * The real name Nsbindidi and the first monument of the\r      Manethonian Smendes were discovered in the quarries of\r      Dababîeh, opposite Gebelên.\r \r \r It would have been impossible for him to have exercised any authority\r over so rich and powerful a personage as Hrihor had he not possessed\r rights to the crown, before which even the high priests of Amon were\r obliged to bow, and hence it has been supposed that he was a descendant\r of Ramses II. The descendants of this sovereign were doubtless divided\r into at least two branches, one of which had just become extinct,\r leaving no nearer heir than Hrihor, while another, of which there were\r many ramifications, had settled in the Delta. The majority of these\r descendants had become mingled with the general population, and had sunk\r to the condition of private individuals; they had, however, carefully\r preserved the tradition of their origin, and added proudly to their name\r the qualification of royal son of Ramses. They were degenerate scions\r of the Ramessides, and had neither the features nor the energy of their\r ancestor. One of them, Zodphta-haûfônkhi, whose mummy was found at Deîr\r el-Baharî, appears to have been tall and vigorous, but the head lacks\r the haughty refinement which characterizes those of Seti I. and Ramses\r II., and the features are heavy and coarse, having a vulgar, commonplace\r expression.\r \r [Illustration: 093.jpg ZODPHTAHAUFONKHI, ROYAL SON OF RAMSES]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the photograph by Insinger.\r \r It seems probable that one branch of the family, endowed with greater\r capability than the rest, was settled at Tanis, where Sesostris had,\r as we have seen, resided for many years; Smendes was the first of this\r branch to ascend the throne. The remembrance of his remote ancestor,\r Ramses IL, which was still treasured up in the city he had completely\r rebuilt, as well as in the Delta into which he had infused new life, was\r doubtless of no small service in securing the crown for his descendant,\r when, the line of the Theban kings having come to an end, the Tanites\r put in their claim to the succession. We are unable to discover if\r war broke out between the two competitors, or if they arrived at an\r agreement without a struggle; but, at all events, we may assume that,\r having divided Egypt between them, neither of them felt himself strong\r enough to overcome his rival, and contented himself with the possession\r of half the empire, since he could not possess it in its entirety. We\r may fairly believe that Smendes had the greater right to the throne,\r and, above all, the more efficient army of the two, since, had it been\r otherwise, Hrihor would never have consented to yield him the priority.\r \r The unity of Egypt was, to outward appearances, preserved, through the\r nominal possession by Smendes of the suzerainty; but, as a matter of\r fact, it had ceased to exist, and the fiction of the two kingdoms\r had become a reality for the first time within the range of history.\r Henceforward there were two Egypts, governed by different constitutions\r and from widely remote centres. Theban Egypt was, before all things,\r a community recognizing a theocratic government, in which the kingly\r office was merged in that of the high priest. Separated from Asia by the\r length of the Delta, it turned its attention, like the Pharaohs of the\r VIth and XIIth dynasties, to Ethiopia, and owing to its distance from\r the Mediterranean, and from the new civilization developed on its\r shores, it became more and more isolated, till at length it was reduced\r to a purely African state. Northern Egypt, on the contrary, maintained\r contact with European and Asiatic nations; it took an interest in their\r future, it borrowed from them to a certain extent whatever struck it as\r being useful or beautiful, and when the occasion presented itself, it\r acted in concert with Mediterranean powers. There was an almost constant\r struggle between these two divisions of the empire, at times\r breaking out into an open rupture, to end as often in a temporary\r re-establishment of unity. At one time Ethiopia would succeed in\r annexing Egypt, and again Egypt would seize some part of Ethiopia; but\r the settlement of affairs was never final, and the conflicting elements,\r brought with difficulty into harmony, relapsed into their usual\r condition at the end of a few years. A kingdom thus divided against\r itself could never succeed in maintaining its authority over those\r provinces which, even in the heyday of its power, had proved impatient\r of its yoke.\r \r Asia was associated henceforward in the minds of the Egyptians with\r painful memories of thwarted ambitions, rather than as offering a field\r for present conquest. They were pursued by the memories of their former\r triumphs, and the very monuments of their cities recalled what they\r were anxious to forget. Wherever they looked within their towns they\r encountered the representation of some Asiatic scene; they read the\r names of the cities of Syria on the walls of their temples; they saw\r depicted on them its princes and its armies, whose defeat was recorded\r by the inscriptions as well as the tribute which they had been forced\r to pay. The sense of their own weakness prevented the Egyptians from\r passing from useless regrets to action; when, however, one or other of\r the Pharaohs felt sufficiently secure on the throne to carry his troops\r far afield, he was always attracted to Syria, and crossed her frontiers,\r often, alas! merely to encounter defeat.\r \r [Illustration: 095.jpg Tailpiece]\r \r \r \r \r CHAPTER II--THE RISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE\r \r \r _PHOENICIA AND THE NORTHERN NATIONS AFTER THE DEATH OP RAMSES III.--THE\r FIRST ASSYRIAN EMPIRE: TIGLATH-PILESUR I.--THE ARAMÆANS AND THE KHÂTI._\r \r _The continuance of Egyptian influence over Syrian civilization after\r the death of Ramses III.--Egyptian myths in Phoenicia: Osiris and Isis\r at Byblos--Horus, Thot, and the origin of the Egyptian alphabet--The\r tombs at Arvad and the Kabr-Hiram; Egyptian designs in Phoenician glass\r and goldsmithswork--Commerce with Egypt, the withdrawal of Phoenician\r colonies in the Ægean Sea and the Achæans in Cyprus; maritime\r expeditions in the Western Mediterranean._\r \r _Northern Syria: the decadence of the Hittites and the steady growth\r of the Aramæan tribes--The decline of the Babylonian empire under the\r Cossæan kings, and its relations with Egypt: Assuruballit, Bammdn-nirdri\r I. and the first Assyrian conquests--Assyria, its climate, provinces,\r and cities: the god Assur and his Ishtar--The wars against\r Chaldæa: Shalmaneser I., Tulculi-ninip I., and the taking of\r Babylon--Belchadrezzar and the last of the Cosssæans._\r \r _The dynasty of Pashê: Nebuchadrezzar I., his disputes with Elam, his\r defeat by Assurrîshishî--The legend of the first Assyrian empire, Ninos\r and Semiramis--The Assyrians and their political constitution: the\r limmu, the king and his divine character, his hunting and his wars--The\r Assyrian army: the infantry and chariotry, the crossing of rivers, mode\r of marching in the plains and in the mountain districts--Camps, battles,\r sieges; cruelty shown to the vanquished, the destruction of towns and\r the removal of the inhabitants, the ephemeral character of the Assyrian\r conquests._\r \r _Tiglath pileser I.: Ms campaign against the Mushhu, his conquest of\r Kurhhi and of the regions of the Zab--The petty Asiatic kingdoms\r and their civilization: art and writing in the old Hittite\r states--Tiglath-pileser I. in Nairi and in Syria: his triumphal stele\r at Sebbeneh-Su--His buildings, his hunts, his conquest of\r Babylon--Merodach-nadin-akhi and the close of the Pashê\r dynasty--Assur-belkala and Samsi-rammân III.: the decline of\r Assyria--Syria without a foreign rider: the incapacity of the Khdti to\r give unity to the country._\r \r \r [Illustration: 099.jpg Page Image]\r \r \r \r \r CHAPTER II--THE RISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE\r \r \r _Phoenicia and the northern nations after the death of Ramses III.--The\r first Assyrian empire: Tiglath-pileser I.--The Aramoans and the Khâti._\r \r \r The cessation of Egyptian authority over countries in which it had so\r long prevailed did not at once do away with the deep impression which\r it had made upon their constitution and customs. While the nobles\r and citizens of Thebes were adopting the imported worship of Baal and\r Astartê, and were introducing into the spoken and written language words\r borrowed from Semitic speech, the Syrians, on the other hand, were\r not unreceptive of the influence of their conquerors. They had applied\r themselves zealously to the study of Egyptian arts, industry and\r religion, and had borrowed from these as much, at least, as they had\r lent to the dwellers on the Nile. The ancient Babylonian foundation\r of their civilization was not, indeed, seriously modified, but it was\r covered over, so to speak, with an African veneer which varied in depth\r according to the locality.*\r \r      * Most of the views put forth in this part of the chapter\r      are based on posterior and not contemporary data. The most\r      ancient monuments which give evidence of it show it in such\r      a complete state that we may fairly ascribe it to some\r      centuries earlier; that is, to the time when Egypt still\r      ruled in Syria, the period of the XIXth and even the XVIIIth\r      dynasty.\r \r Phoenicia especially assumed and retained this foreign exterior. Its\r merchants, accustomed to establish themselves for lengthened periods in\r the principal trade-centres on the Nile, had become imbued therein\r with something of the religious ideas and customs of the land, and\r on returning to their own country had imported these with them and\r propagated them in their neighbourhood. They were not content with other\r household utensils, furniture, and jewellery than those to which they\r had been accustomed on the Nile, and even the Phonician gods seemed to\r be subject to this appropriating mania, for they came to be recognised\r in the indigenous deities of the Said and the Delta. There was, at\r the outset, no trait in the character of Baalat by which she could be\r assimilated to Isis or Hathor: she was fierce, warlike, and licentious,\r and wept for her lover, while the Egyptian goddesses were accustomed\r to shed tears for their husbands only. It was this element of a common\r grief, however, which served to associate the Phonician and Egyptian\r goddesses, and to produce at length a strange blending of their persons\r and the legends concerning them; the lady of Byblos ended in becoming an\r Isis or a Hathor,* and in playing the part assigned to the latter in the\r Osirian drama.\r \r * The assimilation must have been ancient, since the Egyptians of the\r Theban dynasties already accepted Baalat as the Hathor of Byblos.\r \r [Illustration: 101.jpg THE TREE GROWING ON THE TOMB OF OSIRIS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Prisse dAvennes\r \r This may have been occasioned by her city having maintained closer\r relationships than the southern towns with Bûto and Mendes, or by her\r priests having come to recognise a fundamental agreement between their\r theology and that of Egypt. In any case, it was at Byblos that the most\r marked and numerous, as well as the most ancient, examples of borrowing\r from the religions of the Nile were to be found. The theologians of\r Byblos imagined that the coffin of Osiris, after it had been thrown into\r the sea by Typhon, had been thrown up on the land somewhere near their\r city at the foot of a tamarisk, and that this tree, in its rapid growth,\r had gradually enfolded within its trunk the body and its case. King\r Malkander cut it down in order to use it as a support for the roof of\r his palace: a marvellous perfume rising from it filled the apartments,\r and it was not long before the prodigy was bruited abroad. Isis, who was\r travelling through the world in quest of her husband, heard of it, and\r at once realised its meaning: clad in rags and weeping, she sat down\r by the well whither the women of Byblos were accustomed to come every\r morning and evening to draw water, and, being interrogated by them,\r refused to reply; but when the maids of Queen Astartê* approached\r in their turn, they were received by the goddess in the most amiable\r manner--Isis deigning even to plait their hair, and to communicate to\r them the odour of myrrh with which she herself was impregnated.\r \r      * Astartê is the name taken by the queen in the Phoenician\r      version: the Egyptian counterpart of the same narrative\r      substituted for it Nemanous or Saôsis; that is to say, the\r      two principal forms of Hathor--the Hermopolitan Nahmâûît and\r      the Heliopolitan lûsasît. It would appear from the presence\r      of these names that there must have been in Egypt two\r      versions at least of the Phoenician adventures of Isis--the\r      one of Hermopolitan and the other of Heliopolitan origin.\r \r Their mistress came to see the stranger who had thus treated her\r servants, took her into her service, and confided to her the care of her\r lately born son. Isis became attached to the child, adopted it for her\r own, after the Egyptian manner, by inserting her finger in its mouth;\r and having passed it through the fire during the night in order to\r consume away slowly anything of a perishable nature in its body,\r metamorphosed herself into a swallow, and flew around the miraculous\r pillar uttering plaintive cries. Astartê came upon her once while she\r was bathing the child in the flame, and broke by her shrieks of\r fright the charm of immortality. Isis was only able to reassure her by\r revealing her name and the object of her presence there. She opened the\r mysterious tree-trunk, anointed it with essences, and wrapping it in\r precious cloths, transmitted it to the priests of Byblos, who deposited\r it respectfully in their temple: she put the coffin which it contained\r on board ship, and brought it, after many adventures, into Egypt.\r Another tradition asserts, however, that Osiris never found his way back\r to his country: he was buried at Byblos, this tradition maintained, and\r it was in his honour that the festivals attributed by the vulgar to the\r young Adonis were really celebrated. A marvellous fact seemed to support\r this view. Every year a head of papyrus, thrown into the sea at some\r unknown point of the Delta, was carried for six days along the Syrian\r coast, buffeted by wind and waves, and on the seventh was thrown up at\r Byblos, where the priests received it and exhibited it solemnly to the\r people.* The details of these different stories are not in every case\r very ancient, but the first fact in them carries us back to the time\r when Byblos had accepted the sovereignty of the Theban dynasties,\r and was maintaining daily commercial and political relations with the\r inhabitants of the Nile valley.**\r \r      * In the later Roman period it was letters announcing the\r      resurrection of Adonis-Osiris that the Alexandrian women\r      cast into the sea, and these were carried by the current as\r      far as Byblos. See on this subject the commentaries of Cyril\r      of Alexandra and Procopius of Gaza on chap, xviii. of\r      Isaiah.\r \r      ** It is worthy of note that Philo gives to the divinity\r      with the Egyptian name Taautos the part in the ancient\r      history of Phoenicia of having edited the mystic writings\r      put in order by Sanchoniathon at a very early epoch.\r \r The city proclaimed Horus to be a great god.* El-Kronos allied himself\r with Osiris as well as with Adonis; Isis and Baalat became blended\r together at their first encounter, and the respective peoples made\r an exchange of their deities with the same light-heartedness as they\r displayed in trafficking with the products of their soil or their\r industry.\r \r      * This is confirmed by one of the names inscribed on the Tel\r      el-Amarna tablets as being that of a governor of Byblos\r      under Amenôthes IV. This name was read Rabimur, Anrabimur,\r      or Ilrabimur, and finally Ilurabihur: the meaning of it is,\r      Muru is the great god, or Horus is the great god. Muru is\r      the name which we find in an appellation of a Hittite king,\r      Maurusaru, Mauru is king. On an Aramoan cylinder in the\r      British Museum, representing a god in Assyrian dress\r      fighting with two griffins, there is the inscription\r      Horkhu, Harmakhis.\r \r [Illustration: 104.jpg THE PHOENICIAN HORUS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an intaglio engraved in\r      Cesnola. The Phoenician figures of Horus and Thot which I\r      have reproduced were pointed out to me by my friend\r      Clermont-Ganneau.\r \r After Osiris, the Ibis Thot was the most important among the deities\r who had emigrated to Asia. He was too closely connected with the Osirian\r cycle to be forgotten by the Phoenicians after they had adopted his\r companions. We are ignorant of the particular divinity with whom he was\r identified, or would be the more readily associated from some similarity\r in the pronunciation of his name: we know only that he still preserved\r in his new country all the power of his voice and all the subtilty of\r his mind. He occupied there also the position of scribe and enchanter,\r as he had done at Thebes, Memphis, Thinis, and before the chief of each\r Heliopolitan Ennead. He became the usual adviser of El-Kronos at Byblos,\r as he had been of Osiris and Horus; he composed charms for him,\r and formulae which increased the warlike zeal of his partisans; he\r prescribed the form and insignia of the god and of his attendant\r deities, and came finally to be considered as the inventor of letters.*\r \r      * The part of counsellor which Thot played in connexion with\r      the god of Byblos was described at some length in the\r      writings attributed to Sankhoniathon.\r \r [Illustration: 105.jpg THE PHOENICIAN THOT]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after an intaglio engraved in M. de\r      Vogué.\r \r The epoch, indeed, in which he became a naturalised Phoenician coincides\r approximately with a fundamental revolution in the art of writing--that\r in which a simple and rapid stenography was substituted for the\r complicated and tedious systems with which the empires of the ancient\r world had been content from their origin. Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, Arvad,\r had employed up to this period the most intricate of these systems. Like\r most of the civilized nations of Western Asia, they had conducted their\r diplomatic and commercial correspondence in the cuneiform character\r impressed upon clay tablets. Their kings had had recourse to a\r Babylonian model for communicating to the Amenôthes Pharaohs the\r expression of their wishes or their loyalty; we now behold them, after\r an interval of four hundred years and more*--during which we have no\r examples of their monuments--possessed of a short and commodious script,\r without the encumbrance of ideograms, determinatives, polyphony and\r syllabic sounds, such as had fettered the Egyptian and Chaldæan\r scribes, in spite of their cleverness in dealing with them. Phonetic\r articulations were ultimately resolved into twenty-two sounds, to each\r of which a special sign was attached, which collectively took the place\r of the hundreds or thousands of signs formerly required.\r \r      * The inscription on the bronze cup dedicated to the Baal of\r      the Lebanon, goes back probably to the time of Hiram I., say\r      the Xth century before our era; the reasons advanced by\r      Winckler for dating it in the time of Hiram II. have not\r      been fully accepted up to the present. By placing the\r      introduction of the alphabet somewhere between Amenôthes IV.\r      in the XVth and Hiram I. in the Xth century before our era,\r      and by taking the middle date between them, say the\r      accession of the XXIsdynasty towards the year 1100 B.C. for\r      its invention or adoption, we cannot go far wrong one way or\r      the other.\r \r [Illustration: 106.jpg ONE OF THE MOST ANCIENT PHOENICIAN INSCRIPTIONS]\r \r      Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from a heliogravure. This is the cup\r      of the Baal of the Lebanon.\r \r This was an alphabet, the first in point of time, but so ingenious and\r so pliable that the majority of ancient and modern nations have found\r it able to supply all their needs--Greeks and Europeans of the western\r Mediterranean on the one hand, and Semites of all kinds, Persians and\r Hindus on the other.\r \r [Illustration: 107.jpg Table of Alphabets]\r \r It must have originated between the end of the XVIIIth and the beginning\r of the XXIst dynasties, and the existence of Pharaonic rule in Phoenicia\r during this period has led more than one modern scholar to assume that\r it developed under Egyptian influence.*\r \r      * The hypothesis of an Egyptian origin, suggested casually\r      by Champollion, has been ably dealt with by E. de Rougé. E.\r      de Rougé derives the alphabet from the Hieratic, and his\r      identifications have been accepted by Lauth, by Brugsch, by\r      P. Lenormant, and by Isaac Taylor. Halévy would take it from\r      the Egyptian hieroglyphics directly without the intervention\r      of the Hieratic. The Egyptian origin, strongly contested of\r      late, has been accepted by the majority of scholars.\r \r Some affirm that it is traceable directly to the hieroglyphs, while\r others seek for some intermediary in the shape of a cursive script,\r and find this in the Hieratic writing, which contains, they maintain,\r prototypes of all the Phoenician letters. Tables have been drawn up,\r showing at a glance the resemblances and differences which appear\r respectively to justify or condemn their hypothesis. Perhaps the\r analogies would be more evident and more numerous if we were in\r possession of inscriptions going back nearer to the date of origin. As\r it is, the divergencies are sufficiently striking to lead some scholars\r to seek the prototype of the alphabet elsewhere--either in Babylon, in\r Asia Minor, or even in Crete, among those barbarous hieroglyphs which\r are attributed to the primitive inhabitants of the island. It is no easy\r matter to get at the truth amid these conflicting theories. Two points\r only are indisputable; first, the almost unanimous agreement among\r writers of classical times in ascribing the first alphabet to the\r Phoenicians; and second, the Phonician origin of the Greek, and\r afterwards of the Latin alphabet which we employ to-day.\r \r To return to the religion of the Phoenicians: the foreign deities were\r not content with obtaining a high place in the estimation of priests\r and people; they acquired such authority over the native gods that\r they persuaded them to metamorphose themselves almost completely into\r Egyptian divinities.\r \r [Illustration: 109.jpg RASHUF ON HIS LION]\r \r      Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from a photograph reproduced in\r      Clermont-Ganneau.\r \r One finds among the majority of them the emblems commonly used in the\r Pharaonic temples, sceptres with heads of animals, head-dress like the\r Pschent, the _crux ansata_, the solar disk, and the winged scarab. The\r lady of Byblos placed the cows horns upon her head from the moment\r she became identified with Hathor.* The Baal of the neighbouring\r Arvad--probably a form of Bashuf--was still represented as standing\r upright on his lion in order to traverse the high places: but while, in\r the monument which has preserved the figure of the god, both lion and\r mountain are given according to Chaldæan tradition, he himself, as the\r illustration shows, is dressed after the manner of Egypt, in the striped\r and plaited loin-cloth, wears a large necklace on his neck and bracelets\r on his arms, and bears upon his head the white mitre with its double\r plume and the Egyptian uraaus.**\r \r      * She is represented as Hathor on the stele of Iéhav-melek,\r      King of Byblos, during the Persian period.\r \r      ** This monument, which belonged to the Péretié collection,\r      was found near Amrîth, at the place called Nahr-Abrek. The\r      dress and bearing are so like those of the Rashuf\r      represented on Egyptian monuments, that I have no hesitation\r      in regarding this as a representation of that god.\r \r He brandishes in one hand the weapon of the victor, and is on the point\r of despatching with it a lion, which he has seized by the tail with\r the other, after the model of the Pharaonic hunters, Amenôthes I. and\r Thûtmosis III. The lunar disk floating above his head lends to him,\r it is true, a Phonician character, but the winged sun of Heliopolis\r hovering above the disk leaves no doubt as to his Egyptian antecedents.*\r \r      * The Phonician symbol represents the crescent moon holding\r      the darkened portion in its arms, like the symbol reserved\r      in Egypt for the lunar gods.\r \r [Illustration: 110.jpg A PHOENICIAN GOD IN HIS EGYPTIAN SHRINE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Renan.\r \r The worship, too, offered to these metamorphosed gods was as much\r changed as the deities themselves; the altars assumed something of the\r Egyptian form, and the tabernacles were turned into shrines, which were\r decorated at the top with a concave groove, or with a frieze made up of\r repetitions of the uraeus. Egyptian fashions had influenced the better\r classes so far as to change even their mode of dealing with the dead, of\r which we find in not a few places clear evidence. Travellers arriving in\r Egypt at that period must have been as much astonished as the tourist of\r to-day by the monuments which the Egyptians erected for their dead.\r \r [Illustration: 111.jpg AMENÔTHES I. SEIZING A LION]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin. This monument was in the Louvre\r      Museum. Analogous figures of gods or kings holding a lion by\r      the tail are found on various monuments of the Theban\r      dynasties.\r \r The pyramids which met their gaze, as soon as they had reached the apex\r of the Delta, must have far surpassed their ideas of them, no matter how\r frequently they may have been told about them, and they must have been\r at a loss to know why such a number of stones should have been brought\r together to cover a single corpse. At the foot of these colossal\r monuments, lying like a pack of hounds asleep around their master, the\r mastabas of the early dynasties were ranged, half buried under the sand,\r but still visible, and still visited on certain days by the descendants\r of their inhabitants, or by priests charged with the duty of keeping\r them up. Chapels of more recent generations extended as a sort of screen\r before the ancient tombs, affording examples of the two archaic types\r combined--the mastaba more or less curtailed in its proportions, and the\r pyramid with a more or less acute point. The majority of these monuments\r are no longer in existence, and only one of them has come down to us\r intact--that which Amenôthes III. erected in the Serapeum at Memphis in\r honour of an Apis which had died in his reign.\r \r [Illustration: 112.jpg A PHOENICIAN MASTABA AT ARVAD]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the restoration by Thobois, as\r      given in Renan. The cuttings made in the lower stonework\r      appear to be traces of unfinished steps. The pyramid at the\r      top is no longer in existence, but its remains are scattered\r      about the foot of the monument, and furnished M. Thobois\r      with the means of reconstructing with exactness the original\r      form.\r \r Phoenicians visiting the Nile valley must have carried back with them\r to their native country a remembrance of this kind of burying-place, and\r have suggested it to their architects as a model. One of the cemeteries\r at Arvad contains a splendid specimen of this imported design.*\r \r      * Pietschmann thinks that the monument is not older than the\r      Greek epoch, and it must be admitted that the cornice is not\r      such as we usually meet with in Egypt in Theban times;\r      nevertheless, the very marked resemblance to the Theban\r      mastaba shows that it must have been directly connected with\r      the Egyptian type which prevailed from the XVIIIth to the\r      XXth dynasties.\r \r [Illustration: 113.jpg TWO OF THE TOMBS AT ARVAD]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a water-colour by Thobois,\r      reproduced in Renan.\r \r It is a square tower some thirty-six feet high; the six lower courses\r consist of blocks, each some sixteen and a half feet long, joined to each\r other without mortar. The two lowest courses project so as to form a\r kind of pedestal for the building. The cornice at the top consists of\r a deep moulding, surmounted by a broad flat band, above which rises the\r pyramid, which attains a height of nearly thirty feet. It is impossible\r to deny that it is constructed on a foreign model; it is not a slavish\r imitation, however, but rather an adaptation upon a rational plan to\r the conditions of its new home. Its foundations rest on nothing but a\r mixture of soil and sand impregnated with water, and if vaults had been\r constructed beneath this, as in Egypt, the body placed there would soon\r have corrupted away, owing to the infiltration of moisture. The dead\r bodies were, therefore, placed within the structure above ground, in\r chambers corresponding to the Egyptian chapel, which were superimposed\r the one upon the other. The first storey would furnish space for three\r bodies, and the second would contain twelve, for which as many niches\r were provided. In the same cemetery we find examples of tombs which the\r architect has constructed, not after an Egyptian, but a Chaldæan model.\r A round tower is here substituted for the square structure and a\r cupola for the pyramid, while the cornice is represented by crenellated\r markings. The only Egyptian feature about it is the four lions, which\r seem to support the whole edifice upon their backs.*\r \r      * The fellahîn in the neighbourhood call these two monuments\r      the Meghazîl or distaffs.\r \r Arvad was, among Phoenician cities, the nearest neighbour to the\r kingdoms on the Euphrates, and was thus the first to experience either\r the brunt of an attack or the propagation of fashions and ideas from\r these countries. In the more southerly region, in the country about\r Tyre, there are fewer indications of Babylonian influence, and such\r examples of burying-places for the ruling classes as the Kabr-Hiram\r and other similar tombs correspond with the mixed mastaba of the Theban\r period. We have the same rectangular base, but the chapel and its\r crowning pyramid are represented by the sarcophagus itself with its\r rigid cover. The work is of an unfinished character, and carelessly\r wrought, but there is a charming simplicity about its lines and a\r harmony in its proportions which betray an Egyptian influence.\r \r [Illustration: 115.jpg THE KABR-HIRAM NEAR TYRE]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a sketch by Thobois, reproduced by\r      Renan.\r \r The spirit of imitation which we find in the religion and architecture\r of Phoenicia is no less displayed in the minor arts, such as\r goldsmithswork, sculpture in ivory, engraving on gems, and\r glass-making. The forms, designs, and colours are all rather those of\r Egypt than of Chaldæa. The many-hued glass objects, turned out by the\r manufacturers of the Said in millions, furnished at one time valuable\r cargoes for the Phoenicians; they learned at length to cast and\r colour copies of these at home, and imitated their Egyptian models so\r successfully that classical antiquity was often deceived by them.*\r \r      * Glass manufacture was carried to such a degree of\r      perfection among the Phoenicians, that many ancient authors\r      attributed to them the invention of glass.\r \r Their engravers, while still continuing to employ cones and cylinders\r of Babylonian form, borrowed the scarab type also, and made use of it\r on the bezils of rings, the pendants of necklaces, and on a kind of\r bracelet used partly for ornament and partly as a protective amulet.\r The influence of the Egyptian model did not extend, however, amongst the\r masses, and we find, therefore, no evidence of it in the case of common\r objects, such as those of coarse sand or glazed earthenware. Egyptian\r scarab forms were thus confined to the rich, and the material upon which\r they are found is generally some costly gem, such as cut and polished\r agate, onyx, haematite, and lapis-lazuli. The goldsmiths did not\r slavishly copy the golden and silver bowls which were imported from the\r Delta; they took their inspiration from the principles displayed in\r the ornamentation of these objects, but they treated the subjects\r after their own manner, grouping them afresh and blending them with\r new designs. The intrinsic value of the metal upon which these artistic\r conceptions had been impressed led to their destruction, and among the\r examples which have come down to us I know of no object which can be\r traced to the period of the Egyptian conquest. It was Theban art for\r the most part which furnished the Phoenicians with their designs. These\r included the lotus, the papyrus, the cow standing in a thicket and\r suckling her calf, the sacred bark, and the king threatening with his\r uplifted arm the crowd of conquered foes who lie prostrate before him.\r \r [Illustration: 117.jpg EGYPTIAN TREATMENT OF THE COW ON A PHOENICIAN\r BOWL]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after Grifi.\r \r The kings double often accompanied him on some of the original objects,\r impassive and armed with the banner bearing the name of Horus. The\r Phoenician artist modified this figure, which in its original form\r did not satisfy his ideas of human nature, by transforming it into\r a protective genius, who looks with approval on the exploits of his\r _protégé_, and gathers together the corpses of those he has slain. Once\r these designs had become current among the goldsmiths, they continued to\r be supplied for a long period, without much modification, to the markets\r of the Eastern and Western worlds. Indeed, it was natural that they\r should have taken a stereotyped form, when we consider that the\r Phoenicians who employed them held continuous commercial relations\r with the country whence they had come--a country of which, too, they\r recognised the supremacy. Egypt in the Ramesside period was, as we\r have seen, distinguished for the highest development of every branch of\r industry; it had also a population which imported and exported more raw\r material and more manufactured products than any other.\r \r [Illustration: 118.jpg THE KING AND HIS DOUBLE ON A PHOENICIAN BOWL]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Longpérier.\r \r The small nation which acted as a commercial intermediary between Egypt\r and the rest of the world had in this traffic a steady source of profit,\r and even in providing Egypt with a single article--for example, bronze,\r or the tin necessary for its preparation--could realise enormous\r profits. The people of Tyre and Sidon had been very careful not to\r alienate the good will of such rich customers, and as long as the\r representatives of the Pharaoh held sway in Syria, they had shown\r themselves, if not thoroughly trustworthy vassals, at least less\r turbulent than their neighbours of Arvad and Qodshû. Even when the\r feebleness and impotence of the successors of Ramses III. relieved them\r from the obligation of further tribute, they displayed towards their old\r masters such deference that they obtained as great freedom of trade with\r the ports of the Delta as they had enjoyed in the past. They maintained\r with these ports the same relations as in the days of their dependence,\r and their ships sailed up the river as far as Memphis, and even higher,\r while the Egyptian galleys continued to coast the littoral of Syria.\r An official report addressed to Hrihor by one of the ministers of the\r Theban Amon, indicates at one and the same time the manner in which\r these voyages were accomplished, and the dangers to which their crews\r were exposed. Hrihor, who was still high priest, was in need of foreign\r timber to complete some work he had in hand, probably the repair of the\r sacred barks, and commanded the official above mentioned to proceed\r by sea to Byblos, to King Zikarbâl,* in order to purchase cedars of\r Lebanon.\r \r      * This is the name which classical tradition ascribed to the\r      first husband of Dido, the founder of Carthage--Sicharbas,\r      Sichaeus, Acerbas.\r \r The messenger started from Tanis, coasted along Kharu, and put into\r the harbour of Dor, which then belonged to the Zakkala: while he was\r revictualling his ship, one of the sailors ran away with the cash-box.\r The local ruler, Badilu, expressed at first his sympathy at this\r misfortune, and gave his help to capture the robber; then unaccountably\r changing his mind he threw the messenger into prison, who had\r accordingly to send to Egypt to procure fresh funds for his liberation\r and the accomplishment of his mission. Having arrived at Byblos, nothing\r occurred there worthy of record. The wood having at length been cut and\r put on board, the ship set sail homewards. Driven by contrary winds,\r the vessel was thrown upon the coast of Alasia, where the crew were\r graciously received by the Queen Khatiba. We have evidence everywhere,\r it may be stated, as to the friendly disposition displayed, either with\r or without the promptings of interest, towards the representative of the\r Theban pontiff. Had he been ill-used, the Phoenicians living on Egyptian\r territory would have been made to suffer for it.\r \r Navigators had to take additional precautions, owing to the presence\r of Ægean or Asiatic pirates on the routes followed by the mercantile\r marine, which rendered their voyages dangerous and sometimes interrupted\r them altogether. The Syrian coast-line was exposed to these marauders\r quite as much as the African had been during the sixty or eighty years\r which followed the death of Ramses II.; the seamen of the north--Achæans\r and Tyrseni, Lycians and Shardanians--had pillaged it on many occasions,\r and in the invasion which followed these attacks it experienced as\r little mercy as Naharaim, the Khâti, and the region of the Amorites. The\r fleets which carried the Philistines, the Zakkala, and their allies had\r devastated the whole coast before they encountered the Egyptian ships of\r Ramses III. near Magadîl, to the south of Carmel. Arvad as well as Zahi\r had succumbed to the violence of their attack, and if the cities of\r Byblos, Berytus, Sidon, and Tyre had escaped, their suburbs had been\r subjected to the ravages of the foe.*\r \r      * See, for this invasion, vol. v. pp. 305-311, of the\r      present work.\r \r Peace followed the double victory of the Egyptians, and commerce on\r the Mediterranean resumed once more its wonted ways, but only in those\r regions where the authority of the Pharaoh and the fear of his vengeance\r were effective influences. Beyond this sphere there were continual\r warfare, piracy, migrations of barbaric hordes, and disturbances of all\r kinds, among which, if a stranger ventured, it was at the almost certain\r risk of losing his life or liberty. The area of undisturbed seas became\r more and more contracted in proportion as the memory of past defeats\r faded away. Cyprus was not comprised within it, and the Ægeans, who were\r restrained by the fear of Egypt from venturing into any region under\r her survey, perpetually flocked thither in numerous bodies. The Achæans,\r too, took up their abode on this island at an early date--about the time\r when some of their bands were infesting Libya, and offering their help\r to the enemies of the Pharaoh. They began their encroachments on the\r northern side of the island--the least rich, it is true, but the nearest\r to Cilicia, and the easiest to hold against the attacks of their rivals.\r The disaster of Piriu had no doubt dashed their hopes of finding a\r settlement in Egypt: they never returned thither any more, and the\r current of emigration which had momentarily inclined towards the south,\r now set steadily towards the east, where the large island of Cyprus\r offered an unprotected and more profitable field of adventure. We know\r not how far they penetrated into its forests and its interior. The\r natives began, at length, under their influence, to despise the customs\r and mode of existence with which they had been previously contented:\r they acquired a taste for pottery rudely decorated after the Mycenean\r manner, for jewellery, and for the bronze swords which they had seen in\r the hands of the invaders. The Phoenicians, in order to maintain their\r ground against the intruders, had to strengthen their ancient posts\r or found others--such as Carpasia, Gerynia, and Lapathos on the\r Achæan coast itself, Tamassos near the copper-mines, and a new town,\r Qart-hadashât, which is perhaps only the ancient Citium under a new\r name.* They thus added to their earlier possessions on the island\r regions on its northern side, while the rest either fell gradually into\r the hands of Hellenic adventurers, or continued in the possession of\r the native populations. Cyprus served henceforward as an advance-post\r against the attacks of Western nations, and the Phoenicians must have\r been thankful for the good fortune which had made them see the wisdom\r of fortifying it. But what became of their possessions lying outside\r Cyprus? They retained several of them on the southern coasts of Asia\r Minor, and Rhodes remained faithful to them, as well as Thasos, enabling\r them to overlook the two extremities of the Archipelago;** but, owing to\r the movements of the People of the Sea and the political development of\r the Mycenean states, they had to give up the stations and harbours of\r refuge which they held in the other islands or on the continent.\r \r      * It is mentioned in the inscription of Baal of Lebanon, and\r      in the Assyrian inscriptions of the VII century B.C.\r \r      * This would appear to be the case, as far as Rhodes is\r      concerned, from the traditions which ascribed the final\r      expulsion of the Phoenicians to a Doric invasion from Argos.\r      The somewhat legendary accounts of the state of affairs\r      after the Hellenic conquest are in the fragments of Ergias\r      and Polyzelos.\r \r They still continued, however, to pay visits to these\r localities--sometimes in the guise of merchants and at others as\r raiders, according to their ancient custom. They went from port to port\r as of old, exposing their wares in the market-places, pillaging the\r farms and villages, carrying into captivity the women and children whom\r they could entice on board, or whom they might find defenceless on the\r strand; but they attempted all this with more risk than formerly, and\r with less success. The inhabitants of the coast were possessed of\r fully manned ships, similar in form to those of the Philistines or\r the Zakkala, which, at the first sight of the Phoenicians, set out in\r pursuit of them, or, following the example set by their foe, lay in\r wait for them behind some headland, and retaliated upon them for their\r cruelty. Piracy in the Archipelago was practised as a matter of course,\r and there was no islander who did not give himself up to it when\r the opportunity offered, to return to his honest occupations after a\r successful venture. Some kings seem to have risen up here and there who\r found this state of affairs intolerable, and endeavoured to remedy it\r by every means within their power: they followed on the heels of the\r corsairs and adventurers, whatever might be their country; they followed\r them up to their harbours of refuge, and became an effective police\r force in all parts of the sea where they were able to carry their flag.\r The memory of such exploits was preserved in the tradition of the Cretan\r empire which Minos had constituted, and which extended its protection\r over a portion of continental Greece.\r \r If the Phoenicians had had to deal only with the piratical expeditions\r of the peoples of the coast or with the jealous watchfulness of the\r rulers of the sea, they might have endured the evil, but they had now\r to put up, in addition, with rivalry in the artistic and industrial\r products of which they had long had the monopoly. The spread of art\r had at length led to the establishment of local centres of production\r everywhere, which bade fair to vie with those of Phoenicia. On the\r continent and in the Cyclades there were produced statuettes, intaglios,\r jewels, vases, weapons, and textile fabrics which rivalled those of the\r East, and were probably much cheaper. The merchants of Tyre and Sidon\r could still find a market, however, for manufactures requiring great\r technical skill or displaying superior taste--such as gold or silver\r bowls, engraved or decorated with figures in outline--but they had to\r face a serious falling off in their sales of ordinary goods. To extend\r their commerce they had to seek new and less critical markets, where the\r bales of their wares, of which the Ægean population was becoming weary,\r would lose none of their attractions. We do not know at what date they\r ventured to sail into the mysterious region of the Hesperides, nor by\r what route they first reached it. It is possible that they passed from\r Crete to Cythera, and from this to the Ionian Islands and to the point\r of Calabria, on the other side of the straits of Otranto, whence they\r were able to make their way gradually to Sicily.*\r \r      * Ed. Meyer thinks that the extension of Phoenician commerce\r      to the Western Mediterranean goes back to the XVIIIth\r      dynasty, or, at the latest, the XVth century before our era.\r      Without laying undue stress on this view, I am inclined to\r      ascribe with him, until we get further knowledge, the\r      colonisation of the West to the period immediately following\r      the movements of the People of the Sea and the diminution of\r      Phoenician trade in the Grecian Archipelago. Exploring\r      voyages had been made before this, but the founding of\r      colonies was not earlier than this epoch.\r \r Did the fame of their discovery, we may ask, spread so rapidly in the\r East as to excite there the cupidity and envy of their rivals? However\r this may have been, the People of the Sea, after repeated checks\r in Africa and Syria, and feeling more than ever the pressure of the\r northern tribes encroaching on them, set out towards the west, following\r the route pursued by the Phoenicians. The traditions current among\r them and collected afterwards by the Greek historians give an account,\r mingled with many fabulous details, of the causes which led to their\r migrations and of the vicissitudes which they experienced in the course\r of them. Daedalus having taken flight from Crete to Sicily, Minos, who\r had followed in his steps, took possession of the greater part of the\r island with his Eteocretes. Iolaos was the leader of Pelasgic bands,\r whom he conducted first into Libya and finally to Sardinia. It came also\r to pass that in the days of Atys, son of Manes, a famine broke out and\r raged throughout Lydia: the king, unable to provide food for his people,\r had them numbered, and decided by lot which of the two halves of the\r population should expatriate themselves under the leadership of his son\r Tyrsenos. Those-who were thus fated to leave their country assembled at\r Smyrna, constructed ships there, and having embarked on board of them\r what was necessary, set sail in quest of a new home. After a long\r and devious voyage, they at length disembarked in the country of the\r Umbrians, where they built cities, and became a prosperous people under\r the name of Tyrseni, being thus called after their leader Tyrsenos.*\r \r      * Herodotus, whence all the information of other classical\r      writers is directly or indirectly taken. Most modern\r      historians reject this tradition. I see no reason for my own\r      part why they should do so, at least in the present state of\r      our knowledge. The Etrurians of the historical period were\r      the result of a fusion of several different elements, and\r      there is nothing against the view that the Tursha--one of\r      these elements--should have come from Asia Minor, as\r      Herodotus says. Properly understood, the tradition seems\r      well founded, and the details may have been added\r      afterwards, either by the Lydians themselves, or by the\r      Greek historians who collected the Lydian traditions.\r \r The remaining portions of the nations who had taken part in the attack\r on Egypt--of which several tribes had been planted by Ramses III. in\r the Shephelah, from Gaza to Carmel--proceeded in a series of successive\r detachments from Asia Minor and the Ægean Sea to the coasts of Italy\r and of the large islands; the Tursha into that region which was known\r afterwards as Etruria, the Shardana into Sardinia, the Zakkala into\r Sicily, and along with the latter some Pulasati, whose memory is still\r preserved on the northern slope of Etna. Fate thus brought the Phonician\r emigrants once more into close contact with their traditional enemies,\r and the hostility which they experienced in their new settlements from\r the latter was among the influences which determined their further\r migration from Italy proper, and from the region occupied by the\r Ligurians between the Arno and the Ebro. They had already probably\r reached Sardinia and Corsica, but the majority of their ships had sailed\r to the southward, and having touched at Malta, Gozo, and the small\r islands between Sicily and the Syrtes, had followed the coast-line of\r Africa, until at length they reached the straits of Gribraltar and the\r southern shores of Spain. No traces remain of their explorations, or of\r their early establishments in the western Mediterranean, as the towns\r which they are thought--with good reason in most instances--to have\r founded there belong to a much later date. Every permanent settlement,\r however, is preceded by a period of exploration and research, which may\r last for only a few years or be prolonged to as many centuries. I am\r within the mark, I think, in assuming that Phonician adventurers,\r or possibly even the regular trading ships of Tyre and Sidon, had\r established relations with the semi-barbarous chiefs of Botica as early\r as the XIIth century before our era, that is, at the time when the power\r of Thebes was fading away under the weak rule of the pontiffs of Amon\r and the Tanite Pharaohs.\r \r The Phoenicians were too much absorbed in their commercial pursuits\r to aspire to the inheritance which Egypt was letting slip through her\r fingers. Their numbers were not more than sufficient to supply men\r for their ships, and they were often obliged to have recourse to their\r allies or to mercenary tribes--the Leleges or Carians--in order to\r provide crews for their vessels or garrisons for their trading posts;\r it was impossible, therefore, for them to think of raising armies fit to\r conquer or keep in check the rulers on the Orontes or in Naharaim. They\r left this to the races of the interior--the Amorites and Hittites--and\r to their restless ambition. The Hittite power, however, had never\r recovered from the terrible blow inflicted on it at the time of the\r Asianic invasion.\r \r [Illustration: 128.jpg AZÂZ--ONE OF THIS TUMULI ON THE ANCIENT HITTITE\r PLAIN]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. Barthélémy.\r \r The confederacy of feudal chiefs, which had been brought momentarily\r together by Sapalulu and his successors, was shattered by the violence\r of the shock, and the elements of which it was composed were engaged\r henceforward in struggles with each other. At this time the entire plain\r between the Amanus and the Euphrates was covered with rich cities, of\r which the sites are represented to-day by only a few wretched villages\r or by heaps of ruins. Arabian and Byzantine remains sometimes crown the\r summit of the latter, but as soon as we reach the lower strata we find\r in more or less abundance the ruins of buildings of the Greek or Persian\r period, and beneath these those belonging to a still earlier time. The\r history of Syria lies buried in such sites, and is waiting only for a\r patient and wealthy explorer to bring it to light.* The Khâti proper\r were settled to the south of the Taurus in the basin of the Sajur,\r but they were divided into several petty states, of which that which\r possessed Carchemish was the most important, and exercised a practical\r hegemony over the others. Its chiefs alone had the right to call\r themselves kings of the Khâti. The Patinu, who were their immediate\r neighbours on the west, stretched right up to the Mediterranean above\r the plains of Naharairn and beyond the Orontes; they had absorbed, it\r would seem, the provinces of the ancient Alasia. Aramaeans occupied\r the region to the south of the Patinu between the two Lebanon ranges,\r embracing the districts of Hamath and Qobah.**\r \r      * The results of the excavations at Zinjirli are evidence of\r      what historical material we may hope to find in these\r      tumuli. See the account of the earlier results in P. von\r      Luschan, _Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli_, 1893.\r \r      ** The Aramaeans are mentioned by Tiglath-pileser I. as\r      situated between the Balikh, the Euphrates, and the Sajur.\r \r The valleys of the Amanus and the southern slopes of the Taurus included\r within them some half-dozen badly defined principalities--Samalla on the\r Kara-Su,* Gurgum** around Marqasi, the Qui*** and Khilakku**** in\r the classical Cilicia, and the Kasku^ and Kummukh^^ in a bend of the\r Euphrates to the north and north-east of the Khâti.\r \r      * The country of Samalla, in Egyptian Samalûa, extended\r      around the Tell of Zinjirli, at the foot of the Amanus, in\r      the valley of Marash of the Arab historians.\r \r      ** The name has been read Gamgumu, Gaugum, and connected by\r      Tom-kins with the Egyptian Augama, which he reads Gagama, in\r      the lists of Thûtmosis III. The Aramaean inscription on the\r      statue of King Panammu shows that it must be read Gurgumu,\r      and Sachau has identified this new name with that of Jurjum,\r      which was the name by which the province of the Amanus,\r      lying between Baias and the lake of Antioch, was known in\r      the Byzantine period; the ancient Gurgum stretches further\r      towards the north, around the town of Marqasi, which Tomkins\r      and Sachau have identified with Marash.\r \r      *** The site of the country of Qui was determined by\r      Schrader; it was that part of the Cilician plain which\r      stretches from the Amanus to the mountains of the Kêtis, and\r      takes in the great town of Tarsus. F. Lenor-mant has pointed\r      out that this country is mentioned twice in the Scriptures\r      (1 _Kings_ x, 28 and 2 _Chron_. i. 16), in the time of\r      Solomon. The designation of the country, transformed into\r      the appellation of an eponymous god, is found in the name\r      Qauîsaru, Qauî is king.\r \r      **** Khilakku, the name of which is possibly the same as the\r      Egyptian Khalakka, is the Cilicia Trachsea of classical\r      geographers.\r \r      ^ The country of Kashku, which has been connected with\r      Kashkisha, which takes the place of Karkisha in an Egyptian\r      text, was still a dependency of the Hittites in the time of\r      Tiglath-pileser. It was in the neighbourhood of the Urumu,\r      whose capital seems to have been Urum, the Ourima of\r      Ptolemy, near the bend of the Euphrates between Sumeîsat and\r      Birejik; it extended into the Commagene of classical times,\r      on the borders of Melitene and the Tubal.\r \r      ^^ Kummukh lay on both sides of the Euphrates and of the\r      Upper Tigris; it became gradually restricted, until at\r      length it was conterminous with the Commagene of classical\r      geographers.\r \r The ancient Mitanni to the east of Carchemish, which was so active in\r the time of the later Amenôthes, had now ceased to exist, and there\r was but a vague remembrance of its farmer prowess. It had foundered\r probably in the great cataclysm which engulfed the Hittite empire,\r although its name appears inscribed once more among those of the vassals\r of Egypt on the triumphal lists of Ramses III. Its chief tribes had\r probably migrated towards the regions which were afterwards described by\r the Greek geographers as the home of the Matieni on the Halys and in the\r neighbourhood of Lake Urmiah. Aramaean kingdoms, of which the greatest\r was that of Bit-Adîni,* had succeeded them, and bordered the Euphrates\r on each side as far as the Chalus and Balikh respectively; the ancient\r Harran belonged also to them, and their frontier stretched as far as\r Hamath, and to that of the Patinu on the Orontes.\r \r      * The province of Bît-Adîni was specially that part of the\r      country which lay between the Euphrates and the Balikh, but\r      it extended also to other Syrian provinces between the\r      Euphrates and the Aprie.\r \r It was, as we have seen, a complete breaking up of the old\r nationalities, and we have evidence also of a similar disintegration in\r the countries to the north of the Taurus, in the direction of the Black\r Sea. Of the mighty Khâti with whom Thûtmosis III. had come into contact,\r there was no apparent trace: either the tribes of which they were\r composed had migrated towards the south, or those who had never left\r their native mountains had entered into new combinations and lost even\r the remembrance of their name. The Milidu, Tabal (Tubal), and Mushku\r (Meshech) stretched behind each other from east to west on the confines\r of the Tokhma-Su, and still further away other cities of less importance\r contended for the possession of the Upper Saros and the middle region of\r the Halys. These peoples, at once poor and warlike, had been attracted,\r like the Hittites of some centuries previous, by the riches accumulated\r in the strongholds of Syria. Eevolutions must have been frequent in\r these regions, but our knowledge of them is more a matter of conjecture\r than of actual evidence. Towards the year 1170 B.C. the Mushku swooped\r down on Kummukh, and made themselves its masters; then pursuing their\r good fortune, they took from the Assyrians the two provinces, Alzi and\r Purukuzzi, which lay not far from the sources of the Tigris and the\r Balikh.*\r \r      * The _Annals of Tiglath-pileser I_. place their invasion\r      fifty years before the beginning of his reign. Ed. Meyer saw\r      a connexion between this and the invasion of the People of\r      the Sea, which took place under Ramses III. I think that the\r      invasion of the Mushku was a purely local affair, and had\r      nothing in common with the general catastrophe occasioned by\r      the movement of the Asiatic armies.\r \r A little later the Kashku, together with some Aramaeans, broke into\r Shubarti, then subject to Assyria, and took possession of a part of it.\r The majority of these invasions had, however, no permanent result: they\r never issued in the establishment of an empire like that of the Khâti,\r capable by its homogeneity of offering a serious resistance to the march\r of a conqueror from the south. To sum up the condition of affairs: if\r a redistribution of races had brought about a change in Northern Syria,\r their want of cohesion was no less marked than in the time of the\r Egyptian wars; the first enemy to make an attack upon the frontier of\r one or other of these tribes was sure of victory, and, if he persevered\r in his efforts, could make himself master of as much territory as he\r might choose. The Pharaohs had succeeded in welding together their\r African possessions, and their part in the drama of conquest had\r been played long ago; but the cities of the Tigris and the Lower\r Euphrates--Nineveh and Babylon-were ready to enter the lists as soon as\r they felt themselves strong enough to revive their ancient traditions of\r foreign conquest.\r \r The successors of Agumkakrimê were not more fortunate than he had been\r in attempting to raise Babylon once more to the foremost rank; their\r want of power, their discord, the insubordination and sedition that\r existed among their Cossæan troops, and the almost periodic returns of\r the Theban generals to the banks of the Euphrates, sometimes even to\r those of the Balikh and the Khabur, all seemed to conspire to aggravate\r the helpless state into which Babylon had sunk since the close of the\r dynasty of Uruazagga. Elam was pressing upon her eastern, and Assyria\r on her northern frontier, and their kings not only harassed her with\r persistent malignity, but, by virtue of their alliances by marriage with\r her sovereigns, took advantage of every occasion to interfere both\r in domestic and state affairs; they would espouse the cause of some\r pretender during a revolt, they would assume the guardianship of such\r of their relatives as were left widows or minors, and, when the occasion\r presented itself, they took possession of the throne of Bel, or bestowed\r it on one of their creatures. Assyria particularly seemed to regard\r Babylon with a deadly hatred. The capitals of the two countries were not\r more than some one hundred and eighty-five miles apart, the intervening\r district being a flat and monotonous alluvial plain, unbroken by any\r feature which could serve as a natural frontier. The line of demarcation\r usually followed one of the many canals in the narrow strip of land\r between the Euphrates and the Tigris; it then crossed the latter, and\r was formed by one of the rivers draining the Iranian table-land,--either\r the Upper Zab, the Radanu, the Turnat, or some of their ramifications in\r the spurs of the mountain ranges. Each of the two states strove by every\r means in its power to stretch its boundary to the farthest limits,\r and to keep it there at all hazards. This narrow area was the scene of\r continual war, either between the armies of the two states or those of\r partisans, suspended from time to time by an elaborate treaty which was\r supposed to settle all difficulties, but, as a matter of fact, satisfied\r no one, and left both parties discontented with their lot and jealous of\r each other. The concessions made were never of sufficient importance\r to enable the conqueror to crush his rival and regain for himself the\r ancient domain of Khammurabi; his losses, on the other hand, were\r often considerable enough to paralyse his forces, and prevent him from\r extending his border in any other direction. When the Egyptians seized\r on Naharaim, Assyria and Babylon each adopted at the outset a different\r attitude towards the conquerors. Assyria, which never laid any permanent\r claims to the seaboard provinces of the Mediterranean, was not disposed\r to resent their occupation by Egypt, and desired only to make sure of\r their support or their neutrality. The sovereign then ruling Assyria,\r but of whose name we have no record, hastened to congratulate Thûtmosis\r III. on his victory at Megiddo, and sent him presents of precious vases,\r slaves, lapis-lazuli, chariots and horses, all of which the Egyptian\r conqueror regarded as so much tribute. Babylon, on the other hand, did\r not take action so promptly as Assyria; it was only towards the latter\r years of Thûtmosis that its king, Karaîndash, being hard pressed by the\r Assyrian Assurbelnishishu, at length decided to make a treaty with the\r intruder.*\r \r      * We have no direct testimony in support of this hypothesis,\r      but several important considerations give it probability. As\r      no tribute from Babylon is mentioned in the _Annals of\r      Thûtmosis III_., we must place the beginning of the\r      relations between Egypt and Chaldæa at a later date. On the\r      other hand, Burnaburiash II., in a letter written to\r      Amenôthes III., cites Karaîndash as the first of _his\r      fathers,_ who had established friendly relations with _the\r      fathers_ of the Pharaoh, a fact which obliges us to place\r      the interchange of presents before the time of Amenôthes\r      III.: as the reigns of Amenôthes II. and of Thûtmosis IV.\r      were both short, it is probable that these relations began\r      in the latter years of Thûtmosis III.\r \r The remoteness of Egypt from the Babylonian frontier no doubt relieved\r Karaîndash from any apprehension of an actual invasion by the Pharaohs;\r but there was the possibility of their subsidising some nearer enemy,\r and also of forbidding Babylonish caravans to enter Egyptian provinces,\r and thus crippling Chaldæan commerce. Friendly relations, when once\r established, soon necessitated a constant interchange of embassies and\r letters between the Nile and the Euphrates. As a matter of fact, the\r Babylonian king could never reconcile himself to the idea that Syria had\r passed out of his hands. While pretending to warn the Pharaoh of Syrian\r plots against him,* the Babylonians were employing at the same time\r secret agents, to go from city to city and stir up discontent at\r Egyptian rule, praising the while the great Cosssean king and his\r armies, and inciting to revolt by promises of help never meant to be\r fulfilled. Assyria, whose very existence would have been endangered by\r the re-establishment of a Babylonian empire, never missed an opportunity\r of denouncing these intrigues at head-quarters: they warned the royal\r messengers and governors of them, and were constantly contrasting the\r frankness and honesty of their own dealings with the duplicity of their\r rival.\r \r      * This was done by Kurigalzu I., according to a letter\r      addressed by his son Burnaburiash to Amenôthes IV.\r \r This state of affairs lasted for more than half a century, during which\r time both courts strove to ingratiate themselves in the favour of the\r Pharaoh, each intriguing for the exclusion of the other, by exchanging\r presents with him, by congratulations on his accession, by imploring\r gifts of wrought or unwrought gold, and by offering him the most\r beautiful women of their family for his harem. The son of Karaîndash,\r whose name still remains to be discovered, bestowed one of his daughters\r on the young Amenôthes III.: Kallimasin, the sovereign who succeeded\r him, also sent successively two princesses to the same Pharaoh. But\r the underlying bitterness and hatred would break through the veneer of\r polite formula and protestations when the petitioner received, as the\r result of his advances, objects of inconsiderable value such as a lord\r might distribute to his vassals, or when he was refused a princess of\r solar blood, or even an Egyptian bride of some feudal house; at such\r times, however, an ironical or haughty epistle from Thebes would recall\r him to a sense of his own inferiority.\r \r As a fact, the lot of the Cossæan sovereigns does not appear to have\r been a happy one, in spite of the variety and pomposity of the titles\r which they continued to assume. They enjoyed but short lives, and we\r know that at least three or four of them--Kallimasin, Burnaburiash I.,\r and Kurigalzu I. ascended the throne in succession during the forty\r years that Amenôthes III. ruled over Egypt and Syria.*\r \r      * The copy we possess of the Royal Canon of Babylon is\r      mutilated at this point, and the original documents are not\r      sufficiently complete to fill the gap. About two or three\r      names are missing after that of Agumkakrimê, and the reigns\r      must have been very short, if indeed, as I think, Agumka-\r      krimî and Karaîndash were both contemporaries of the earlier\r      Pharaohs bearing the name of Thûtmosis. The order of the\r      names which have come down to us is not indisputably\r      established. The following order appears to me to be the\r      most probable at present:--\r \r      Karaîndash. Kallimasin. Burnaburiash I. Kurigalzu I.\r      Burnaburiash II. Karakhardash. Kadashmankiiarbê I.\r      Nazibugas II.. Kurigalzu II. Nazimaruttasii. Kadashmanturgu.\r \r      This is, with a slight exception, the classification adopted\r      by Winckler, and that of Hilprecht differs from it only in\r      the intercalation of Kudurturgu and Shagaraktiburiash\r      between Burnaburiash II. and Karakhardash.\r \r Perhaps the rapidity of this succession may have arisen from some\r internal revolution or from family disturbances. The Chaldæans of the\r old stock reluctantly rendered obedience to these Cosssean kings,\r and, if we may judge from the name, one at least of these ephemeral\r sovereigns, Kallimasin, appears to have been a Semite, who owed his\r position among the Cossoan princes to some fortunate chance. A few\r rare inscriptions stamped on bricks, one or two letters or documents of\r private interest, and some minor objects from widely distant spots, have\r enabled us to ascertain the sites upon which these sovereigns erected\r buildings; Karaîndash restored the temple of Nana at Uruk, Burnaburiash\r and Kurigalzu added to that of Shamash at Larsam, and Kurigalzu took in\r hand that of Sin at Uru. We also possess a record of some of their acts\r in the fragments of a document, which a Mnevite scribe of the time of\r Assurbanipal had compiled, or rather jumbled together,* from certain\r Babylonian chronicles dealing with the wars against Assyria and Elam,\r with public treaties, marriages, and family quarrels. We learn from\r this, for example, that Burnaburiash I. renewed with Buzurassur the\r conventions drawn up between Karaîndash and Assurbelnishishu. These\r friendly relations were maintained, apparently, under Kurigalzu I.\r and Assur-nadin-akhi, the son of Buzurassur;** if Kurigalzu built or\r restored the fortress, long called after him Dur-Kurigalzu,*** at one\r of the fords of the Narmalka, it was probably as a precautionary measure\r rather than because of any immediate danger. The relations between\r the two powers became somewhat strained when Burnaburiash II.\r and Assuruballît had respectively succeeded to Kurigalzu and\r Assur-nadin-akhi; **** this did not, however, lead to hostilities, and\r the subsequent betrothal of Karakhardash, son of Burnaburiash II., to\r Mubauîtatseruâ, daughter of Assuruballît, tended to restore matters to\r their former condition.\r \r      * This is what is generally called the Synchronous\r      History, the principal remains of which were discovered and\r      published by H. Rawlinson. It is a very unskilful\r      complication, in which Winckler has discovered several\r      blunders.\r \r      ** Assur-nadin-akhi I. is mentioned in a Tel el-Amarna\r      tablet as being the father of Assuruballît.\r \r      *** This is the present Akerkuf, as is proved by the\r      discovery of bricks bearing the name of Kurigalzu; but\r      perhaps what I have attributed to Kurigalzu I. must be\r      referred to the second king of that name.\r \r      **** We infer this from the way in which Burnaburiash speaks\r      of the Assyrians in the correspondence with Amenôthes IV.\r \r The good will between the two countries became still more pronounced\r when Kadashmankharbê succeeded his father Karakhardash. The Cossæan\r soldiery had taken umbrage at his successor and had revolted,\r assassinated Kadashmankharbê, and proclaimed king in his stead a man\r of obscure origin named Nazibùgash. Assuruballît, without a moments\r hesitation, took the side of his new relatives; he crossed the frontier,\r killed Nazibugash, and restored the throne to his sisters child,\r Kurigalzu II., the younger. The young king, who was still a minor at\r his accession, appears to have met with no serious difficulties; at any\r rate, none were raised by his Assyrian cousins, Belnirârî I. and his\r successor Budîlu.*\r \r      * The _Synchronous History_ erroneously places the events of\r      the reign of Rammân-nirâri in that of Belnirârî. The order\r      of succession of Buzurassur, Assuruballît, Belnirârî, and\r      Budîlu, has been established by the bricks of Kalah-Shergât.\r \r Towards the close of his reign, however, revolts broke out, and it was\r only by sustained efforts that he was able to restore order in Babylon,\r Sippara, and the Country of the Sea. While the king was in the midst of\r these difficulties, the Elamites took advantage of his troubles to\r steal from him a portion of his territory, and their king, Khurbatila,\r challenged him to meet his army near Dur-Dungi. Kurigalzu accepted the\r challenge, gained a decisive victory, took his adversary prisoner, and\r released him only on receiving as ransom a province beyond the Tigris;\r he even entered Susa, and, from among other trophies of past wars,\r resumed possession of an agate tablet belonging to Dungi, which the\r veteran Kudurnakhunta had stolen from the temple of Nipur nearly\r a thousand years previously. This victory was followed by the\r congratulations of most of his neighbours, with the exception of\r Bammân-nirâri II., who had succeeded Budîlu in Assyria, and probably\r felt some jealousy or uneasiness at the news. He attacked the Cossæans,\r and overthrew them at Sugagi, on the banks of the Salsallât; their\r losses were considerable, and Kurigalzu could only obtain peace by the\r cession to Assyria of a strip of territory the entire length of the\r north-west frontier, from the confines of the Shubari country, near\r the sources of the Khabur, to the suburbs of Babylon itself. Nearly the\r whole of Mesopotamia thus changed hands at one stroke, but Babylon had\r still more serious losses to suffer. Nazimaruttash, who attempted to\r wipe out the disaster sustained by his father Kurigalzu, experienced two\r crushing defeats, one at Kar-Ishtar and the other near Akarsallu, and\r the treaty which he subsequently signed was even more humiliating for\r his country than the preceding one. All that part of the Babylonian\r domain which lay nearest to Nineveh was ceded to the Assyrians, from\r Pilaski on the right bank of the Tigris to the province of Lulumê in\r the Zagros mountains. It would appear that the Cossæan tribes who had\r remained in their native country, took advantage of these troublous\r times to sever all connection with their fellow-countrymen established\r in the cities of the plain; for we find them henceforward carrying on a\r petty warfare for their own profit, and leading an entirely independent\r life. The descendants of Gandish, deprived of territories in the north,\r repulsed in the east, and threatened in the south by the nations of\r the Persian Gulf, never recovered their former ascendency, and their\r authority slowly declined during the century which followed these\r events. Their downfall brought about the decadence of the cities over\r which they had held sway; and the supremacy which Babylon had exercised\r for a thousand years over the countries of the Euphrates passed into the\r hands of the Assyrian kings.\r \r Assyria itself was but a poor and insignificant country when compared\r with her rival. It occupied, on each side of the middle course of the\r Tigris, the territory lying between the 35th and 37th parallels of\r latitude.*\r \r      * These are approximately the limits of the first Assyrian\r      empire, as given by the monuments; from the Persian epoch\r      onwards, the name was applied to the whole course of the\r      Tigris as far as the mountain district. The ancient\r      orthography of the name is Aushâr.\r \r It was bounded on the east by the hills and mountain ranges running\r parallel to the Zagros Chain--Gebel Guar, Gebel Gara, Zerguizavân-dagh,\r and Baravân-dagh, with their rounded monotonous limestone ridges, scored\r by watercourses and destitute of any kind of trees. On the north it\r was hemmed in by the spurs of the Masios, and bounded on the east by an\r undefined line running from Mount Masios to the slopes of Singar,\r and from these again to the Chaldæan plain; to the south the frontier\r followed the configuration of the table-land and the curve of the low\r cliffs, which in prehistoric times had marked the limits of the Persian\r Gulf; from here the boundary was formed on the left side of the Tigris\r by one of its tributaries, either the Lower Zab or the Badanu. The\r territory thus enclosed formed a compact and healthy district: it was\r free from extremes of temperature arising from height or latitude, and\r the relative character and fertility of its soil depended on the absence\r or presence of rivers. The eastern part of Assyria was well watered by\r the streams and torrents which drained the Iranian plateau and the lower\r mountain chains which ran parallel to it. The beds of these rivers are\r channelled so deeply in the alluvial soil, that it is necessary to stand\r on the very edge of their banks to catch a sight of their silent and\r rapid waters; and it is only in the spring or early summer, when they\r are swollen by the rains and melting snow, that they spread over the\r adjacent country. As soon as the inundation is over, a vegetation of the\r intensest green springs up, and in a few days the fields and meadows are\r covered with a luxuriant and fragrant carpet of verdure. This brilliant\r growth is, however, short-lived, for the heat of the sun dries it up as\r quickly as it appears, and even the corn itself is in danger of being\r burnt up before reaching maturity. To obviate such a disaster, the\r Assyrians had constructed a network of canals and ditches, traces of\r which are in many places still visible, while a host of _shadufs_\r placed along their banks facilitated irrigation in the dry seasons. The\r provinces supplied with water in this manner enjoyed a fertility which\r passed into a proverb, and was well known among the ancients; they\r yielded crops of cereals which rivalled those of Babylonia, and included\r among their produce wheat, barley, millet, and sesame. But few olive\r trees were cultivated, and the dates were of inferior quality; indeed,\r in the Greek period, these fruits were only used for fattening pigs and\r domestic animals. The orchards contained the pistachio, the apple, the\r pomegranate, the apricot, the vine, the almond, and the fig, and, in\r addition to the essences common to both Syria and Egypt, the country\r produced cédrats of a delicious scent which were supposed to be an\r antidote to all kinds of poisons. Assyria was not well wooded, except in\r the higher valleys, where willows and poplars bordered the rivers, and\r sycamores, beeches, limes, and plane trees abounded, besides several\r varieties of pines and oaks, including a dwarf species of the latter,\r from whose branches manna was obtained.\r \r [Illustration: 143.jpg THE 1ST ASSYRIAN EMPIRE--MAP]\r \r This is a saccharine substance, which is deposited in small lumps, and\r is found in greater abundance during wet years and especially on foggy\r days. When fresh, it has an agreeable taste and is pleasant to eat;\r but as it will not keep in its natural state, the women prepare it for\r exportation by dissolving it in boiling water, and evaporating it to a\r sweetish paste, which has more or less purgative, qualities. The aspect\r of the country changes after crossing the Tigris westward. The slopes of\r Mount Masios are everywhere furrowed with streams, which feed the Khabur\r and its principal affluent, the Kharmis;* woods become more frequent,\r and the valleys green and shady.\r \r      * The Kharmis is the Mygdonios of Greek geographers, the\r      Hirmâs of the Arabs; the latter name may be derived from\r      Kharmis, or it may be that it merely presents a fortuitous\r      resemblance to it.\r \r The plains extending southwards, however, contain, like those of the\r Euphrates, beds of gypsum in the sub-soil, which render the water\r running through them brackish, and prevent the growth of vegetation.\r The effects of volcanic action are evident on the surface of these\r great steppes; blocks of basalt pierce through the soil, and near the\r embouchure of the Kharmis, a cone, composed of a mass of lava, cinders,\r and scorial, known as the Tell-Kôkab, rises abruptly to a height of\r 325 feet. The mountain chain of Singar, which here reaches its western\r termination, is composed of a long ridge of soft white limestone, and\r seems to have been suddenly thrown up in one of the last geological\r upheavals which affected this part of the country: in some places it\r resembles a perpendicular wall, while in others it recedes in natural\r terraces which present the appearance of a gigantic flight of steps. The\r summit is often wooded, and the spurs covered with vineyards and fields,\r which flourish vigorously in the vicinity of streams; when these fail,\r however, the table-land resumes its desolate aspect, and stretches\r in bare and sandy undulations to the horizon, broken only where it\r is crossed by the Thartar, the sole river in this region which is not\r liable to be dried up, and whose banks may be traced by the scanty line\r of vegetation which it nourishes.\r \r [Illustration: 145.jpg THE VOLCANIC CONE OF KÔKAB]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the cut in Layard.\r \r In a country thus unequally favoured by nature, the towns are\r necessarily distributed in a seemingly arbitrary fashion. Most of them\r are situated on the left bank of the Tigris, where the fertile nature\r of the soil enables it to support a dense population. They were all\r flourishing centres of population, and were in close proximity to each\r other, at all events during the centuries of Assyrian hegemony.*\r \r      * We find, for example, in the inscription of Bavian, a long\r      enumeration of towns and villages situated almost within the\r      suburbs of Nineveh, on the banks of the Khôser.\r \r Three of them soon eclipsed their rivals in political and religious\r importance; these were Kalakh and Nina on the Tigris, and Arbaîlu,\r lying beyond the Upper Zab, in the broken plain which is a continuation\r eastwards of the first spurs of the Zagros.* On the right bank, however,\r we find merely some dozen cities and towns, scattered about in places\r where there was a supply of water sufficient to enable the inhabitants\r to cultivate the soil; as, for example, Assur on the banks of the Tigris\r itself, Singara near the sources of the Thartar, and Nazibina near those\r of the Kharmis, at the foot of the Masios. These cities were not all\r under the rule of one sovereign when Thûtmosis III. appeared in Syria,\r for the Egyptian monuments mention, besides the kingdom of Assyria, that\r of Singara** and Araphka in the upper basin of the Zab.***\r \r      * The name of Arbeles is written in a form which appears to\r      signify the town of the four gods.\r \r      ** This kingdom of Singara is mentioned in the Egyptian\r      lists of Thûtmosis III. Schrader was doubtful as to its\r      existence, but one of its kings is mentioned in a letter\r      from the King of Alasia to Amenôthes IV.; according to\r      Niebuhr, the state of which Singara was the capital must\r      have been identical, at all events at one period, with the\r      Mitanni of the Egyptian texts.\r \r      *** The Arapakha of the Egyptian monuments has been\r      identified with the Arrapakhitis of the Greeks.\r \r Assyria, however, had already asserted her supremacy over this corner of\r Asia, and the remaining princes, even if they were not mere vicegerents\r depending on her king, were not strong enough in wealth and extent\r of territory to hold their own against her, since she was undisputed\r mistress of Assur, Arbeles, Kalakh, and Nineveh, the most important\r cities of the plain. Assur covered a considerable area, and the\r rectangular outline formed by the remains of its walls is still\r discernible on the surface of the soil. Within the circuit of the\r city rose a mound, which the ancient builders had transformed, by\r the addition of masses of brickwork, into a nearly square platform,\r surmounted by the usual palace, temple, and ziggurat; it was enclosed\r within a wall of squared stone, the battlements of which remain to the\r present day.* The whole pile was known as the Ekharsagkurkurra, or the\r House of the terrestrial mountain, the sanctuary in whose decoration\r all the ancient sovereigns had vied with one another, including\r Samsirammân I. and Irishum, who were merely vicegerents dependent upon\r Babylon. It was dedicated to Anshar, that duplicate of Anu who had\r led the armies of heaven in the struggle with Tiâmat; the name Anshar,\r softened into Aushar, and subsequently into Ashshur, was first applied\r to the town and then to the whole country.**\r \r      * Ainsworth states the circumference of the principal mound\r      of Kalah-Shergât to be 4685 yards, which would make it one\r      of the most extensive ruins in the whole country.\r \r      ** Another name of the town in later times was Palbêki, the\r      town of the old empire, the ancient capital, or Shauru.\r      Many Assyriologists believe that the name Ashur, anciently\r      written Aushâr, signified the plain at the edge of the\r      water; and that it must have been applied to the town\r      before being applied to the country and the god. Others, on\r      the contrary, think, with more reason, that it was the god\r      who gave his name to the town and the country; they make a\r      point of the very ancient play of words, which in Assyria\r      itself attributed the meaning good god to the word Ashur.\r      Jensen was the first to state that Ashur was the god Anshâr\r      of the account of the creation.\r \r The god himself was a deity of light, usually represented under the form\r of an armed man, wearing the tiara and having the lower half of his body\r concealed by a feathered disk. He was supposed to hover continually\r over the world, hurling fiery darts at the enemies of his people, and\r protecting his kingly worshippers under the shadow of his wings. Their\r wars were his wars, and he was with them in the thick of the attack,\r placing himself in the front rank with the soldiery,* so that when he\r gained the victory, the bulk of the spoil--precious metals, gleanings\r of the battle-field, slaves and productive lands--fell to his share. The\r gods of the vanquished enemy, moreover, were, like their princes, forced\r to render him homage. In the person of the king he took their statues\r prisoners, and shut them up in his sanctuary; sometimes he would engrave\r his name upon their figures and send them back to their respective\r temples, where the sight of them would remind their worshippers of his\r own omnipotence.** The goddess associated with him as his wife had given\r her name, Nina, to Nineveh,*** and was, as the companion of the Chaldæan\r Bel, styled the divine lady Belit; she was, in fact, a chaste and\r warlike Ishtar, who led the armies into battle with a boldness\r characteristic of her father.****\r \r      * In one of the pictures, for instance, representing the\r      assault of a town, we see a small figure of the god, hurling\r      darts against the enemy. The inscriptions also state that\r      the peoples are alarmed and quit their cities _before the\r      arms of Assur, the powerful one_.\r \r      ** As, for instance, the statues of the gods taken from the\r      Arabs in the time of Esarhaddon. Tiglath-pileser I. had\r      carried away twenty-five statues of gods taken from the\r      peoples of Kurkhi and Kummukh, and had placed them in the\r      temples of Beltis, Ishtar, Anu, and Rammân; he mentions\r      other foreign divinities who had been similarly treated.\r \r      *** The ideogram of the name of the goddess Nina serves to\r      write the name of the town Nineveh. The name itself has been\r      interpreted by Schrader as station, habitation, in the\r      Semitic languages, and by Fr. Delitzsch repose of the god,\r       an interpretation which Delitzsch himself repudiated later\r      on. It is probable that the town, which, like Assur, was a\r      Chaldæan colony, derived its name from the goddess to whom\r      it was dedicated, and whose temple existed there as early as\r      the time of the vicegerent Samsirammân.\r \r      **** Belit is called by Tiglath-pileser I. the great spouse\r      beloved of Assur, but Belit, the lady, is here merely an\r      epithet used for Ishtar: the Assyrian Ishtar, Ishtar of\r      Assur, Ishtar of Nineveh, or rather--especially from the\r      time of the Sargonids--Ishtar of Arbeles, is almost always a\r      fierce and warlike Ishtar, the lady of combat, who directs\r      battles, whose heart incites her to the combat and the\r      struggle. Sayce thinks that the union of Ishtar and Assur\r      is of a more recent date.\r \r [Illustration: 149.jpg ISHTAR AS A WARRIOR BRINGING PRISONERS TO A\r CONQUERING KING]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from squeezes brought back by M. do\r      Morgan.\r \r These two divinities formed an abstract and solitary pair, around whom\r neither story nor myth appears to have gathered, and who never became\r the centre of any complex belief. Assur seems to have had no parentage\r assigned to him, no statue erected to him, and he was not associated\r with the crowd of other divinities; on the contrary, he was called their\r lord, their peerless king, and, as a proof of his supreme sovereignty\r over them, his name was inscribed at the head of their lists, before\r those of the triads constituted by the Chaldæan priests--even before\r those of Anu, Bel, and Ba. The city of Assur, which had been the first\r to tender him allegiance for many years, took precedence of all the\r rest, in spite of the drawbacks with which it had to contend. Placed at\r the very edge of the Mesopotamian desert, it was exposed to the dry and\r burning winds which swept over the plains, so that by the end of the\r spring the heat rendered it almost intolerable as a residence. The\r Tigris, moreover, ran behind it, thus leaving it exposed to the attacks\r of the Babylonian armies, unprotected as it was by any natural fosse\r or rampart. The nature of the frontier was such as to afford it no\r safeguard; indeed, it had, on the contrary, to protect its frontier.\r Nineveh, on the other hand, was entrenched behind the Tigris and the\r Zab, and was thus secure from any sudden attack. Northerly and easterly\r winds prevailed during the summer, and the coolness of the night\r rendered the heat during the day more bearable. It became the custom for\r the kings and vicegerents to pass the most trying months of the year at\r Nineveh, taking up their abode close to the temple of Nina, the Assyrian\r Ishtar, but they did not venture to make it their habitual residence,\r and consequently Assur remained the official capital and chief sanctuary\r of the empire. Here its rulers concentrated their treasures, their\r archives, their administrative offices, and the chief staff of the army;\r from this town they set out on their expeditions against the Cossæans of\r Babylon or the mountaineers of the districts beyond the Tigris, and it\r was in this temple that they dedicated to the god the tenth of the spoil\r on their return from a successful campaign.*\r \r * The majority of scholars now admit that the town of Nina, mentioned by\r Gudea and the vicegerents of Telloh, was a quarter of, or neighbouring\r borough of, Lagash, and had nothing in common with Nineveh, in spite of\r Hommels assumption to the contrary.\r \r The struggle with Chaldæa, indeed, occupied the greater part of their\r energies, though it did not absorb all their resources, and often left\r them times of respite, of which they availed themselves to extend their\r domain to the north and east. We cannot yet tell which of the Assyrian\r sovereigns added the nearest provinces of the Upper Tigris to his\r realm; but when the names of these districts appear-in history, they\r are already in a state of submission and vassalage, and their principal\r towns are governed by Assyrian officers in the same manner as those of\r Singara and Nisibe. Assuruballît, the conqueror of the Cossæans, had\r succeeded in establishing his authority over the turbulent hordes of\r Shubari which occupied the neighbourhood of the Masios, between the\r Khabur and the Balîkh, and extended perhaps as far as the Euphrates; at\r any rate, he was considered by posterity as the actual founder of the\r Assyrian empire in these districts.* Belnirâri had directed his efforts\r in another direction, and had conquered the petty kingdoms established\r on the slopes of the Iranian table-land, around the sources of the two\r Zabs, and those of the Badanu and the Turnât.**\r \r      * It is called, in an inscription of his great-grandson,\r      Rammân-nirâri L, the powerful king who reduced to servitude\r      the forces of the vast country of Shubari, and who enlarged\r      the territory and limits of Assur.\r \r      ** The inscription of Rammân-nirâri I. styles him the prince\r      who crushes the army of the Cossæans, he whose hand\r      unnerves the enemy, and who enlarges the territory and its\r      limits. The Cossæans mentioned in this passage are usually\r      taken to be the Cossæan kings of Babylon, and not the\r      mountain tribes.\r \r Like Susiana, this part of the country was divided up into parallel\r valleys, separated from each other by broken ridges of limestone, and\r watered by the tributaries of the Tigris or their affluents.\r \r [Illustration: 152.jpg A VILLAGE IN THE MOUNTAIN DISTRICTS OF THE OLD\r ASSÆAN KINGDOM]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a drawing by Père Durand.\r \r It was thickly strewn with walled towns and villages; the latter,\r perched upon the precipitous mountain summits, and surrounded by deep\r ravines, owed their security solely to their position, and, indeed,\r needed no fortification. The country abounded in woods and pastures,\r interspersed with cornlands; access to it was gained by one or two\r passes on the eastern side, which thus permitted caravans or armies to\r reach the districts lying between the Erythræan and Caspian Seas.\r The tribes who inhabited it had been brought early under Chaldæan\r civilization, and had adopted the cuneiform script; such of their\r monuments as are still extant resemble the bas-reliefs and inscriptions\r of Assyria.* It is not always easy to determine the precise locality\r occupied by these various peoples; the Guti were situated near the upper\r courses of the Turnât and the Badanu, in the vicinity of the Kashshu;**\r the Lulumê had settled in the neighbourhood of the Batîr, to the north\r of the defiles of Zohab;*** the Namar separated the Lulumê from Elam,\r and were situated half in the plain and half in the mountain, while the\r Arapkha occupied, both banks of the Great Zab.\r \r      * Pinches has published an inscription of a king of Khani,\r      named Tukultimir, son of Ilushaba, written in\r      Chaldeo-Assyrian, and found in the temple of Shamash at\r      Sippara, where the personage himself had dedicated it.\r      Winckler gives another inscription of a king of the Guti,\r      which is also in Semitic and in cuneiform character.\r \r      ** The name is written sometimes Quti, at others Guti, which\r      induced Pognon to believe that they were two different\r      peoples: the territory occupied by this nation must have\r      been originally to the east of the Lesser Zab, in the upper\r      basins of the Adhem and the Diyaleh. Oppert proposes to\r      recognise in these Guti the ancestors of the Goths, who,\r      fifteen hundred years ago, pushed forward to the Russia of\r      the present day: we find, (he adds), in this passage and in\r      others, some of which go back to the third millennium before\r      the Christian era, the earliest mention of the Germanic\r      races.\r \r      *** The people of Lulumô-Lullubi have been pointed out as\r      living to the east of the Lesser Zab by Schrader; their\r      exact position, together with that of Mount Padîr-Batîr in\r      whose neighbourhood they were, has been determined by Père\r      Scheil.\r \r Budîlu carried his arms against these tribes, and obtained successes\r over the Turuki and the Nigimkhi, the princes of the Guti and the Shuti,\r as well as over the Akhlamî and the Iauri.*\r \r      * The Shutu or Shuti, who are always found in connection\r      with the Guti, appear to have been the inhabitants of the\r      lower mountain slopes which separate the basin of the Tigris\r      with the regions of Elam, to the south of Turnât. The\r      Akhlamê were neighbours of the Shuti and the Guti; they were\r      settled partly in the Mesopotamian plain and partly in the\r      neighbourhood of Turnât. The territory of the Iauri is not\r      known; the Turuki and the Nigimkhi were probably situated\r      somewhere to the east of the Great Zab: in the same way that\r      Oppert connects the Goths with the Guti, so Hommel sees in\r      the Turuki the Turks of a very early date.\r \r The chiefs of the Lulumê had long resisted the attacks of their\r neighbours, and one of them, Anu-banini, had engraved on the rocks\r overhanging the road not far from the village of Seripul, a bas-relief\r celebrating his own victories. He figures on it in full armour, wearing\r a turban on his head, and treading underfoot a fallen foe, while Ishtar\r of Arbeles leads towards him a long file of naked captives, bound\r ready for sacrifice. The resistance of the Lulumê was, however, finally\r overcome by Rammân-nirâri, the son of Budilû; he strengthened the\r suzerainty gained by his predecessor over the Guti, the Cossæans, and\r the Shubarti, and he employed the spoil taken from them in beautifying\r the temple of Assur. He had occasion to spend some time in the regions\r of the Upper Tigris, warring against the Shubari, and a fine bronze\r sabre belonging to him has been found near Diarbekîr, among the ruins of\r the ancient Amidi, where, no doubt, he had left it as an offering in one\r of the temples. He was succeeded by Shalmânuâsharîd,* better known to\r us as Shalmaneser I., one of the most powerful sovereigns of this heroic\r age of Assyrian history.\r \r [Illustration: 155.jpg THE SABRE OF RAMMAN-NIRARI]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the sketch published in the\r      _Transactions_ of the Bibl. Arch. Soc.\r \r His reign seems to have been one continuous war against the various\r races then in a state of ferment on the frontiers of his kingdom. He\r appears in the main to have met with success, and in a few years had\r doubled the extent of his dominions.* His most formidable attacks were\r directed against the Aramaeans** of Mount Masios, whose numerous tribes\r had advanced on one side till they had crossed the Tigris, while on the\r other they had pushed beyond the river Balîkh, and had probably reached\r the Euphrates.***\r \r      * Shalmânu-âsharîd, or Shulmânu-âsharîd, signifies the god\r      Shulmânu (Shalmânu) is prince, as Pinches was the first to\r      point out.\r \r      ** Some of the details of these campaigns have been\r      preserved on the much-mutilated obelisk of Assur-nazir-pal.\r      This was a compilation taken from the Annals of Assyria to\r      celebrate the important acts of the kings ancestors. The\r      events recorded in the third column were at first attributed\r      to the reign of Tiglath-pileser I.; Fr. Delitzsch was the\r      first to recognise that they could be referred to the reign\r      of this Shalmaneser, and his opinion is now admitted by most\r      of the Assyriologists who have studied the question.\r \r      *** The identity of the Arami (written also Armaya, Arumi,\r      Arimi) with the Aramoans, admitted by the earlier Kammin-\r      nikâbi Assyriologists.\r \r He captured their towns one after another, razed their fortresses, smote\r the agricultural districts with fire and sword, and then turned upon the\r various peoples who had espoused their cause--the Kirkhu, the Euri, the\r Kharrîn,* and the Muzri, who inhabited the territory between the basins\r of the two great rivers;** once, indeed, he even crossed the Euphrates\r and ventured within the country of Khanigalbat, a feat which his\r ancestors had never even attempted.***\r \r      * The people of the country of Kilkhi, or Kirkhi, the\r      Kurkhi, occupied the region between the Tigris at Diarbekîr\r      and the mountains overlooking the lake of Urumiah. The\r      position of the Ruri is not known, but it is certain that on\r      one side they joined the Aramaeans, and that they were in\r      the neighbourhood of Tushkhân. Kharrân is the Harrân of the\r      Balikh, mentioned in vol. iv. pp. 37, 38 of the present\r      work.\r \r      ** The name of Muzri frequently occurs, and in various\r      positions, among the countries mentioned by the Assyrian\r      conquerors; the frequency of its occurrence is easily\r      explained if we are to regard it as a purely Assyrian term\r      used to designate the military confines or marches of the\r      kingdom at different epochs of its history. The Muzri here\r      in question is the borderland situated in the vicinity of\r      Cilicia, probably the Sophene and the Gumathene of classical\r      geographers. Winckler appears to me to exaggerate their\r      importance when he says they were spread over the whole of\r      Northern Syria as early as the time of Shalmaneser I.\r \r      *** Khanigalbat is the name of the province in which Milid\r      was placed.\r \r He was recalled by a revolt which had broken out in the scattered cities\r of the district of Dur-Kurigalzu; he crushed the rising in spite of the\r help which Kadash-manburiash, King of Babylon, had given to the rebels,\r and was soon successful in subduing the princes of Lulumê. These were\r not the raids of a days duration, undertaken, without any regard to the\r future, merely from love of rapine or adventure. Shalmaneser desired to\r bring the regions which he annexed permanently under the authority of\r Assyria, and to this end he established military colonies in suitable\r places, most of which were kept up long after his death.*\r \r      * More than five centuries after the time of Shalmaneser I.,\r      Assurnazir-pal makes mention, in his _Annals_, of one of\r      these colonies, established in the country of Diarbekîr at\r      Khabzilukha (or Khabzidipkha), near to the town of Damdamua.\r \r He seems to have directed the internal affairs of his kingdom with the\r same firmness and energy which he displayed in his military expeditions.\r It was no light matter for the sovereign to decide on a change in\r the seat of government; he ran the risk of offending, not merely his\r subjects, but the god who presided over the destinies of the State, and\r neither his throne nor his life would have been safe had he failed in\r his attempt. Shalmaneser, however, did not hesitate to make the change,\r once he was fully convinced of the drawbacks presented by Assur as\r a capital. True, he beautified the city, restored its temples, and\r permitted it to retain all its privileges and titles; but having\r done so, he migrated with his court to the town of Kalakh, where\r his descendants continued to reside for several centuries. His son\r Tukulti-ninip made himself master of Babylon, and was the first of his\r race who was able to claim the title of King of Sumir and Akkad.\r The Cossæans were still suffering from their defeat at the hands of\r Bammân-nirâri. Four of their princes had followed Nazimaruttash on the\r throne in rapid succession--Kadashmanturgu, Kadashmanburiash, who\r was attacked by Shalmaneser, a certain Isammeti whose name has been\r mutilated, and lastly, Shagaraktiburiash: Bibeiasdu, son of this latter,\r was in power at the moment when Tukulti-ninip ascended the throne. War\r broke out between the two monarchs, but dragged on without any marked\r advantage on one side or the other, till at length the conflict was\r temporarily suspended by a treaty similar to others which had been\r signed in the course of the previous two or three centuries.*\r \r      * The passage from the _Synchronous History_, republished by\r      Winckler, contains the termination of the mutilated name of\r      a Babylonian king... _ashu_, which, originally left\r      undecided by Winckler, has been restored Bibeiashu by\r      Hilprecht, in the light of monuments discovered at Nipur, an\r      emendation which has since then been accepted by Winckler.\r      Winckler, on his part, has restored the passage on the\r      assumption that the name of the King of Assyria engaged\r      against Bibeiashu was Tukulti-ninip; then, combining this\r      fragment with that in the _Pinches Chronicle_, which deals\r      with the taking of Babylon, he argues that Bibeiashu was the\r      king dethroned by Tukulti-ninip. An examination of the\r      dates, in so far as they are at present known to us from the\r      various documents, seems to me to render this arrangement\r      inadmissible. The _Pinches Chronicle_ practically tells us\r      that Tukulti-ninip reigned over Babylon for _seven years_,\r      when the Chaldæans revolted, and named Rammânshumusur king.\r      Now, the Babylonian Canon gives us the following reigns for\r      this epoch: Bibeiashu _8 years_, Belnadînshumu _1 year 6\r      months_, Kadashmankharbe _1 year 6 months_, Rammânnadînshumu\r      _6 years_, Rammânshumusur _30 years,_ or _9 years_ between\r      the end of the reign of Bibeiashu and the beginning of that\r      of Rammânshumusur, instead of the _7 years_ given us by the\r      _Pinches Chronicle_ for the length of the reign of Tukulti-\r      ninip at Babylon. If we reckon, as the only documents known\r      require us to do, seven years from the beginning of the\r      reign of Rammânshumusur to the date of the taking of\r      Babylon, we are forced to admit that this took place in the\r      reign of Kadashmankharbe IL, and, consequently, that the\r      passage in the _Synchronous History_, in which mention is\r      made of Bibeiashu, must be interpreted as I have done in the\r      text, by the hypothesis of a war prior to that in which\r      Babylon fell, which was followed by a treaty between this\r      prince and the King of Assyria.\r \r The peace thus concluded might have lasted longer but for an unforeseen\r catastrophe which placed Babylon almost at the mercy of her rival. The\r Blamites had never abandoned their efforts to press in every conceivable\r way their claim to the Sebbeneh-su, the supremacy, which, prior to\r Kbammurabi, had been exercised by their ancestors over the whole of\r Mesopotamia; they swooped down on Karduniash with an impetuosity like\r that of the Assyrians, and probably with the same alternations of\r success and defeat. Their king, Kidinkhutrutash, unexpectedly attacked\r Belnadînshumu, son of Bibeiashu, appeared suddenly under the walls\r of Nipur and forced the defences of Durîlu and Étimgarka-lamma:\r Belnadînshumu disappeared in the struggle after a reign of eighteen\r months. Tukulti-ninip left Belna-dînshumus successor, Kadashmankharbe\r II., no time to recover from this disaster; he attacked him in turn,\r carried Babylon by main force, and put a number of the inhabitants to\r the sword. He looted the palace and the temples, dragged the statue of\r Merodach from its sanctuary and carried it off into Assyria, together\r with the badges of supreme power; then, after appointing governors of\r his own in the various towns, he returned to Kalakh, laden with booty;\r he led captive with him several members of the royal family--among\r others, Bammânshumusur, the lawful successor of Bibeiashu.\r \r This first conquest of Chaldæa did not, however, produce any lasting\r results. The fall of Babylon did not necessarily involve the subjection\r of the whole country, and the cities of the south showed a bold front to\r the foreign intruder, and remained faithful to Kadashmankharbe; on the\r death of the latter, some months after his defeat, they hailed as king a\r certain Bammânshumnadîn, who by some means or other had made his escape\r from captivity. Bammânshumnadîn proved himself a better man than his\r predecessors; when Kidinkhutrutash, never dreaming, apparently, that he\r would meet with any serious resistance, came to claim his share of\r the spoil, he defeated him near Ishin, drove him out of the districts\r recently occupied by the Elamites, and so effectually retrieved his\r fortunes in this direction, that he was able to concentrate his whole\r attention on what was going on in the north. The effects of his victory\r soon became apparent: the nobles of Akkad and Karduniash declined to pay\r homage to their Assyrian governors, and, ousting them from the offices\r to which they had been appointed, restored Babylon to the independence\r which it had lost seven years previously. Tukulti-ninip paid dearly\r for his incapacity to retain his conquests: his son Assurnazirpal I.\r conspired with the principal officers, deposed him from the throne, and\r confined him in the fortified palace of Kar-Tukulti-ninip, which he\r had built not far from Kalakh, where he soon after contrived his\r assassination. About this time Rammânshumnadîn disappears, and we can\r only suppose that the disasters of these last years had practically\r annihilated the Cossæan dynasty, for Rammânshu-musur, who was a prisoner\r in Assyria, was chosen as his successor. The monuments tell us nothing\r definite of the troubles which next befell the two kingdoms: we seem to\r gather, however, that Assyria became the scene of civil wars, and\r that the sons of Tukulti-ninip fought for the crown among themselves.\r Tukultiassurbel, who gained the upper hand at the end of six years, set\r Raminân-shumusur at liberty, probably with the view of purchasing\r the support of the Chaldæans, but he did not succeed in restoring his\r country to the position it had held under Shalmaneser and Tukulti-ninip\r I. The history of Assyria presents a greater number of violent contrasts\r and extreme vicissitudes than that of any other Eastern people in the\r earliest times. No sooner had the Assyrians arrived, thanks to the\r ceaseless efforts of five or six generations, at the very summit of\r their ambition, than some incompetent, or perhaps merely unfortunate,\r king appeared on the scene, and lost in a few years all the ground\r which had been gained at the cost of such tremendous exertions: then\r the subject races would rebel, the neighbouring peoples would pluck up\r courage and reconquer the provinces which they had surrendered, till the\r dismembered empire gradually shrank back to its original dimensions. As\r the fortunes of Babylon rose, those of Nineveh suffered a corresponding\r depression: Babylon soon became so powerful that Eammânshumusur was able\r to adopt a patronising tone in his relations with Assur-nirâri I. and\r Nabodaînâni, the descendants of Tukultiassurbel, who at one time shared\r the throne together.*\r \r      * All that we know of these two kings is contained in the\r      copy, executed in the time of Assurbanipal, of a letter\r      addressed to them by Eammânshumusur. They have been placed,\r      at one time or another, either at the beginning of Assyrian\r      history before Assurbelnishishu, or after Tigiath-pileser\r      I., about the XIth or Xth, or even the VIIIth century before\r      our era. It has since been discovered that the\r      Rammânshumusur who wrote this letter was the successor of\r      Tukulti-ninip I. in Chaldæa.\r \r This period of subjection and humiliation did not last long.\r Belkudurusur, who appears on the throne not long after Assurnirâri\r and his partner, resumed military operations against the Cossæans, but\r cautiously at first; and though he fell in the decisive engagement,\r yet Bammân-shumusur perished with him, and the two states were thus\r simultaneously left rulerless. Milishikhu succeeded Bammânshumusur,\r and Ninipahalesharra filled the place of Belkudurusur; the disastrous\r invasion of Assyria by the Chaldæans, and their subsequent retreat, at\r length led to an armistice, which, while it afforded evidence of the\r indisputable superiority of Milishikhu, proved no less plainly the\r independence of his rival. Mero-dachabaliddina I. replaced Milishikhu,\r Zamâniashu-middin followed Merodachabaliddina: Assurdân I., son of\r Ninipahalesharra, broke the treaty, captured the towns of Zabân, Irrîa,\r and Akarsallu, and succeeded in retaining them. The advantage thus\r gained was but a slight one, for these provinces lying between the two\r Zabs had long been subject to Assyria, and had been wrested from her\r since the days of Tukulti-ninip: however, it broke the run of ill luck\r which seemed to have pursued her so relentlessly, and opened the way for\r more important victories. This was the last Cossæan war; at any rate,\r the last of which we find any mention in history: Bel-nadînshumu II.\r reigned three years after Zamâmashu-middin, but when he died there was\r no man of his family whom the priests could invite to lay hold of the\r hand of Merodach, and his dynasty ended with him. It included thirty-six\r kings, and had lasted five hundred and seventy-six years and six\r months.*\r \r * The following is a list of some of the kings of this dynasty according\r to the canon discovered by Pinches.\r \r [Illustration: 163.jpg TABLE]\r \r It had enjoyed its moments of triumph, and at one time had almost seemed\r destined to conquer the whole of Asia; but it appears to have invariably\r failed just as it was on the point of reaching the goal, and it became\r completely exhausted by its victories at the end of every two or\r three generations. It had triumphed over Elam, and yet Elam remained a\r constant peril on its right. It had triumphed over Assyria, yet Assyria,\r after driving it back to the regions of the Upper Tigris, threatened to\r bar the road to the Mediterranean by means of its Masian colonies: were\r they once to succeed in this attempt, what hope would there be left to\r those who ruled in Babylon of ever after re-establishing the traditional\r empire of the ancient Sargon and Khammurabi? The new dynasty sprang from\r a town in Pashê, the geographical position of which is not known. It was\r of Babylonian origin, and its members placed, at the be ginning of their\r protocols, formula which were intended to indicate, in the clearest\r possible manner, the source from which they sprang: they declared\r themselves to be scions of Babylon, its vicegerents, and supreme\r masters. The names of the first two we do not know: the third,\r Nebuchadrezzar, shows himself to have been one of the most remarkable\r men of all those who flourished during this troubled era. At no time,\r perhaps, had Chaldæa been in a more abject state, or assailed by more\r active foes. The Elamite had just succeeded in wresting from her Namar,\r the region from whence the bulk of her chariot-horses were obtained, and\r this success had laid the provinces on the left bank of the Tigris open\r to their attacks. They had even crossed the river, pillaged Babylon,\r and carried away the statue of Bel and that of a goddess named Eria, the\r patroness of Khussi: Merodach, sore angered, held himself aloof from\r the country of Akkad; the kings could no longer take his hands on\r their coming to the throne, and were obliged to reign without proper\r investiture in consequence of their failure to fulfil the rite required\r by religious laws.*\r \r      * The _Donation to Shamud and Shamaî_ informs us that\r      Nebuchadrezzar took the hands of Bel as soon as he\r      regained possession of the statue. The copy we possess of\r      the Royal Canon. Nebuchadrezzar I.s place in the series\r      has, therefore, been the subject of much controversy.\r      Several Assyriologists were from the first inclined to place\r      him in the first or second rank, some being in favour of the\r      first, others preferring the second; Dolitzsch put him into\r      the fifth place, and Winckler, without pronouncing\r      definitely on the position to be assigned him, thought he\r      must come in about half-way down the dynasty. Hilprecht, on\r      taking up the questions, adduced reasons for supposing him\r      to have been the founder of the dynasty, and his conclusions\r      have been adopted by Oppert; they have been disputed by\r      Tiele, who wishes to put the king back to fourth or fifth in\r      order, and by Winckler, who places him fourth or fifth. It\r      is difficult, however, to accept Hilprechts hypothesis,\r      plausible though it is, so long as Assyriologists who have\r      seen the original tablet agree in declaring that the name of\r      the first king began with the sign of _Merodach_ and not\r      with that of _Nebo_, as it ought to do, were this prince\r      really our Nebuchadrezzar.\r \r Nebuchadrezzar arose in Babylon,--roaring like a lion, even as Bammân\r roareth,--and his chosen nobles, roared like lions with him.--To\r Merodach, lord of Babylon, rose his prayer:--How long, for me, shall\r there be sighing and groaning?--How long, for my land, weeping and\r mourning?--How long, for my countries, cries of grief and tears? Till\r what time, O lord of Babylon, wilt thou remain in hostile regions?--Let\r thy heart be softened, and make Babylon joyful,--and let thy face be\r turned toward Eshaggil which thou lovest! Merodach gave ear to the\r plaint of his servant: he answered him graciously and promised his\r aid. Namar, united as it had been with Chaldæa for centuries, did not\r readily become accustomed to its new masters. The greater part of the\r land belonged to a Semitic and Cossæan feudality, the heads of which,\r while admitting their suzerains right to exact military service from\r them, refused to acknowledge any further duty towards him. The kings of\r Susa declined to recognise their privileges: they subjected them to a\r poll-tax, levied the usual imposts on their estates, and forced them\r to maintain at their own expense the troops quartered on them for the\r purpose of guaranteeing their obedience.*\r \r      * Shamuà and Shamaî fled in like manner towards Karduniash,\r      before the King of Elam; it would seem that Rittimerodach\r      had entered into secret negotiations with Nebuchadrezzar,\r      though this is nowhere explicitly stated in the text.\r \r Several of the nobles abandoned everything rather than submit to such\r tyranny, and took refuge with Nebuchadrezzar: others entered into secret\r negotiations with him, and promised to support him if he came to their\r help with an armed force. He took them at their word, and invaded Namar\r without warning in the month of Tamuz, while the summer was at its\r height, at a season in which the Elamites never even dreamt he would\r take the field. The heat was intense, water was not to be got, and the\r army suffered terribly from thirst during its forced march of over\r a hundred miles across a parched-up country. One of the malcontents,\r Eittimerodach, lord of Bitkarziabku, joined Nebuchadrezzar with all the\r men he could assemble, and together they penetrated as far as Ulaî.\r The King of Elam, taken by surprise, made no attempt to check their\r progress, but collected his vassals and awaited their attack on the\r banks of the river in front of Susa. Once the fire of the combat had\r been lighted between the opposing forces, the face of the sun grew dark,\r the tempest broke forth, the whirlwind raged, and in this whirlwind of\r the struggle none of the characters could distinguish the face of his\r neighbour. Nebuchadrezzar, cut off from his own men, was about to\r surrender or be killed, when Eittimerodach flew to his rescue and\r brought him off safely. In the end the Chaldæans gained the upper hand.*\r \r      * _Donation to Rittimerodach,_ col. i. 11. 12-43. The\r      description of the battle as given in this document is\r      generally taken to be merely symbolical, and I have followed\r      the current usage. But if we bear in mind that the text lays\r      emphasis on the drought and severity of the season, we are\r      tempted to agree with Pinches and Budge that its statements\r      should be taken literally. The affair may have been begun in\r      a cloud of dust, and have ended in a downpour of rain so\r      heavy as to partly blind the combatants. The king was\r      probably drawn away from his men in the confusion; it was\r      probably then that he was in danger of being made prisoner,\r      and that Rittimerodach, suddenly coming up, delivered him\r      from the foes who surrounded him.\r \r The Elamites renounced their claims to the possession of Namar, and\r restored the statues of the gods: Nebuchadrezzar at once laid hold of\r the hands of Bel, and thus legalised his accession to the throne. Other\r expeditions against the peoples of Lulurne and against the Cossæans\r restored his supremacy in the regions of the north-east, and a campaign\r along the banks of the Euphrates opened out the road to Syria. He\r rewarded generously those who had accompanied him on his raid against\r Elam. After issuing regulations intended to maintain the purity of the\r breed of horses for which Namar was celebrated, he reinstated in their\r possessions Shamuâ and his son Shamaî, the descendants of one of the\r priestly families of the province, granting them in addition certain\r domains near Upi, at the mouth of the Turnât. He confirmed Rittimerodach\r in possession of all his property, and reinvested him with all the\r privileges of which the King of Elam had deprived him. From that time\r forward the domain of Bitkarziabku was free of the tithe on corn, oxen,\r and sheep; it was no longer liable to provide horses and mares for the\r exchequer, or to afford free passage to troops in time of peace; the\r royal jurisdiction ceased on the boundary of the fief, the seignorial\r jurisdiction alone extended over the inhabitants and their property.\r Chaldæan prefects ruled in Namar, at Khalman, and at the foot of the\r Zagros, and Nebuchadrezzar no longer found any to oppose him save the\r King of Assyria.\r \r The long reign of Assurdân in Assyria does not seem to have been\r distinguished by any event of importance either good or bad: it is true\r he won several towns on the south-east from the Babylonians, but then\r he lost several others on the north-west to the Mushku,* and the loss on\r the one side fully balanced the advantage gained on the other.\r \r      * Hommel has proved, by a very simple calculation, that\r      Assurdân must have been the king in whose reign the Mushku\r      made the inroad into the basin of the Upper Tigris and of\r      the Balikh, which is mentioned in the _Annals of Tiglath-\r      pileser I._ These _Annals_ are our authority for stating\r      that Assurdân was on the throne for a long period, though\r      the exact length of his reign is not known.\r \r His son Mutakkilnusku lived in Assur at peace,* but his grandson,\r Assurîshishî, was a mighty king, conqueror of a score of countries, and\r the terror of all rebels: he scattered the hordes of the Akhlamê and\r broke up their forces; then Ninip, the champion of the gods, permitted\r him to crush the Lulumê and the G-uti in their valleys and on their\r mountains covered with forests. He made his way up to the frontiers of\r Elam,** and his encroachments on territories claimed by Babylon stirred\r up the anger of the Chaldæans against him; Nebuchadrezzar made ready to\r dispute their ownership with him.\r \r      * _Annals of Tiglath-pileser I_. Mutakkilnusku himself has\r      only left us one inscription, in which he declares that he\r      had built a palace in the city of Assyria.\r \r      ** Smith discovered certain fragments of Annals, which he\r      attributed to Assurîshishî. The longest of these tell of a\r      campaign against Elam. Lotz attributed them to Tiglath-\r      pileser I., and is supported in this by most Assyriologists\r      of the day.\r \r The earlier engagements went against the Assyrians; they were driven\r back in disorder, but the victor lost time before one of their\r strongholds, and, winter coming on before he could take it, he burnt his\r engines of war, set fire to his camp, and returned home. Next year,\r a rapid march carried him right under the walls of Assur; then\r Assurîshishî came to the rescue, totally routed his opponent, captured\r forty of his chariots, and drove him flying across the frontier. The war\r died out of itself, its end being marked by no treaty: each side kept\r its traditional position and supremacy over the tribes inhabiting the\r basins of the Turnât and Eadanu. The same names reappear in line after\r line of these mutilated Annals, and the same definite enumerations of\r rebellious tribes who have been humbled or punished. These kings of\r the plain, both Ninevite and Babylonian, were continually raiding the\r country up and down for centuries without ever arriving at any decisive\r result, and a detailed account of their various campaigns would be as\r tedious reading as that of the ceaseless struggle between the Latins and\r Sabines which fills the opening pages of Roman history. Posterity soon\r grew weary of them, and, misled by the splendid position which Assyria\r attained when at the zenith of its glory, set itself to fabricate\r splendid antecedents for the majestic empire established by the latter\r dynasties. The legend ran that, at the dawn of time, a chief named\r Ninos had reduced to subjection one after the other--Babylonia, Media,\r Armenia, and all the provinces between the Indies and the Mediterranean.\r He built a capital for himself on the banks of the Tigris, in the form\r of a parallelogram, measuring a hundred and fifty stadia in length,\r ninety stadia in width; altogether, the walls were four hundred and\r eighty stadia in circumference. In addition to the Assyrians who formed\r the bulk of the population, he attracted many foreigners to Nineveh,\r so that in a few years it became the most flourishing town in the whole\r world. An inroad of the tribes of the Oxus interrupted his labours;\r Ninos repulsed the invasion, and, driving the barbarians back into\r Bactria, laid siege to it; here, in the tent of one of his captains, he\r came upon Semiramis, a woman whose past was shrouded in mystery. She\r was said to be the daughter of an ordinary mortal by a goddess, the\r Ascalonian Derketô. Exposed immediately after her birth, she was found\r and adopted by a shepherd named Simas, and later on her beauty aroused\r the passion of Oannes, governor of Syria. Ninos, amazed at the courage\r displayed by her on more than one occasion, carried her off, made her\r his favourite wife, and finally met his death at her hands. No sooner\r did she become queen, than she founded Babylon on a far more extensive\r scale than that of Nineveh. Its walls were three hundred and sixty\r stadia in length, with two hundred and fifty lofty towers, placed here\r and there on its circuit, the roadway round the top of the ramparts\r being wide enough for six chariots to drive abreast. She made a kind of\r harbour in the Euphrates, threw a bridge across it, and built quays one\r hundred and sixty stadia in length along its course; in the midst of the\r town she raised a temple to Bel. This great work was scarcely finished\r when disturbances broke out in Media; these she promptly repressed, and\r set out on a tour of inspection through the whole of her provinces,\r with a view to preventing the recurrence of similar outbreaks by her\r presence. Wherever she went she left records of her passage behind her,\r cutting her way through mountains, quarrying a pathway through the solid\r rock, making broad highways for herself, bringing rebellious tribes\r beneath her yoke, and raising tumuli to mark the tombs of such of her\r satraps as fell beneath the blows of the enemy. She built Ecbatana in\r Media, Semiramocarta on Lake Van in Armenia, and Tarsus in Cilicia;\r then, having reached the confines of Syria, she crossed the isthmus, and\r conquered Egypt and Ethiopia. The far-famed wealth of India recalled her\r from the banks of the Nile to those of the Euphrates, _en route_ for\r the remote east, but at this point her good fortune forsook her: she was\r defeated by King Stratobates, and returned to her own dominions, never\r again to leave them. She had set up triumphal stelae on the boundaries\r of the habitable globe, in the very midst of Scythia, not far from the\r Iaxartes, where, centuries afterwards, Alexander of Macedon read\r the panegyric of herself which she had caused to be engraved there.\r Nature, she writes, gave me the body of a woman, but my deeds have\r put me on a level with the greatest of men. I ruled over the dominion of\r Ninos, which extends eastwards to the river Hinaman, southwards to the\r countries of Incense and Myrrh, and northwards as far as the Sacaa and\r Sogdiani. Before my time no Assyrian had ever set eyes on the sea: I\r have seen four oceans to which no mariner has ever sailed, so far remote\r are they. I have made rivers to flow where I would have them, in the\r places where they were needed; thus did I render fertile the barren soil\r by watering it with my rivers. I raised up impregnable fortresses, and\r cut roadways through the solid rock with the pick. I opened a way for\r the wheels of my chariots in places to which even the feet of wild\r beasts had never penetrated. And, amidst all these labours, I yet found\r time for my pleasures and for the society of my friends. On discovering\r that her son Ninyas was plotting her assassination, she at once\r abdicated in his favour, in order to save him from committing a crime,\r and then transformed herself into a dove; this last incident betrays the\r goddess to us. Ninos and Semiramis are purely mythical, and their mighty\r deeds, like those ascribed to Ishtar and Gilgames, must be placed in the\r same category as those other fables with which the Babylonian legends\r strive to fill up the blank of the prehistoric period.*\r \r      * The legend of Ninos and Semiramis is taken from Diodorus\r      Siculus, who reproduces, often word for word, the version of\r      Ctesias.\r \r [Illustration: 172.jpg the dove-goddess]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the sketch published in Longpérier.\r \r The real facts were, as we know, far less brilliant and less extravagant\r than those supplied by popular imagination. It would be a mistake,\r however, to neglect or despise them on account of their tedious monotony\r and the insignificance of the characters who appear on the stage. It\r was by dint of fighting her neighbours again and again, without a single\r days respite, that Rome succeeded in forging the weapons with which\r she was to conquer the world; and any one who, repelled by their tedious\r sameness, neglected to follow the history of her early struggles, would\r find great difficulty in understanding how it came about that a city\r which had taken centuries to subjugate her immediate neighbours should\r afterwards overcome all the states on the Mediterranean seaboard with\r such magnificent ease. In much the same way the ceaseless struggles of\r Assyria with the Chaldaeans, and with the mountain tribes of the\r Zagros Chain, were unconsciously preparing her for those lightning-like\r campaigns in which she afterwards overthrew all the civilized nations\r of the Bast one after another. It was only at the cost of unparalleled\r exertions that she succeeded in solidly welding together the various\r provinces within her borders, and in kneading (so to speak) the many\r and diverse elements of her vast population into one compact mass,\r containing in itself all that was needful for its support, and able to\r bear the strain of war for several years at time without giving way, and\r rich enough in men and horses to provide the material for an effective\r army without excessive impoverishment of her trade or agriculture.\r \r [Illustration: 173.jpg AN ASSYRIAN]\r \r Drawn by Boudier, from a painted bas-relief given in Layard.\r \r The race came of an old Semitic strain, somewhat crude as yet, and\r almost entirely free from that repeated admixture of foreign elements\r which had marred the purity of the Babylonian stock. The monuments show\r us a type similar in many respects to that which we find to-day on the\r slopes of Singar, or in the valleys to the east of Mossul.\r \r The figures on the monuments are tall and straight, broad-shouldered and\r wide in the hips, the arms well developed, the legs robust, with good\r substantial feet. The swell of the muscles on the naked limbs is perhaps\r exaggerated, but this very exaggeration of the modelling suggests\r the vigour of the model; it is a heavier, more rustic type than the\r Egyptian, promising greater strength and power of resistance, and in so\r far an indisputable superiority in the great game of war. The head is\r somewhat small, the forehead low and flat, the eyebrows heavy, the eye\r of a bold almond shape, with heavy lids, the nose aquiline, and full at\r the tip, with wide nostrils terminating in a hard, well-defined curve;\r the lips are thick and full, the chin bony, while the face is framed by\r the coarse dark wavy hair and beard, which fell in curly masses over the\r nape of the neck and the breast. The expression of the face is rarely\r of an amiable and smiling type, such as we find in the statues of the\r Theban period or in those of the Memphite empire, nor, as a matter of\r fact, did the Assyrian pride himself on the gentleness of his manners:\r he did not overflow with love for his fellow-man, as the Egyptian made\r a pretence of doing; on the contrary, he was stiff-necked and proud,\r without pity for others or for himself, hot-tempered and quarrelsome\r like his cousins of Chaldæa, but less turbulent and more capable of\r strict discipline. It mattered not whether he had come into the world in\r one of the wretched cabins of a fellah village, or in the palace of\r one of the great nobles; he was a born soldier, and his whole education\r tended to develop in him the first qualities of the soldier--temperance,\r patience, energy, and unquestioning obedience: he was enrolled in an\r army which was always on a war footing, commanded by the god Assur, and\r under Assur, by the king, the vicegerent and representative of the god.\r His life was shut in by the same network of legal restrictions which\r confined that of the Babylonians, and all its more important events\r had to be recorded on tablets of clay; the wording of contracts, the\r formalities of marriage or adoption, the status of bond and free, the\r rites of the dead and funeral ceremonies, had either remained identical\r with those in use during the earliest years of the cities of the Lower\r Euphrates, or differed from them only in their less important details.\r The royal and municipal governments levied the same taxes, used the\r same procedure, employed the same magistrates, and the grades of their\r hierarchy were the same, with one exception. After the king, the highest\r office was filled by a soldier, the _tartan_ who saw to the recruiting\r of the troops, and led them in time of war, or took command of the\r staff-corps whenever the sovereign himself deigned to appear on the\r scene of action.*\r \r      * We can determine the rank occupied, by the _tartanu_ at\r      court by the positions they occupy in the lists of eponymous\r      _limmu_: they invariably come next after the king--a fact\r      which was noticed many years ago.\r \r The more influential of these functionaries bore, in addition to their\r other titles, one of a special nature, which, for the space of one year,\r made its holder the most conspicuous man in the country; they became\r _limmu_, and throughout their term of office their names appeared on\r all official documents. The Chaldæans distinguished the various years of\r each reign by a reference to some event which had taken place in\r each; the Assyrians named them after the _limmu_.* The king was the\r _ex-officio limmu_ for the year following that of his accession, then\r after him the _tartan_, then the ministers and governors of provinces\r and cities in an order which varied little from reign to reign. The\r names of the _limmu_, entered in registers and tabulated--just as,\r later on, were those of the Greek archons and Roman consuls--furnished\r the annalists with a rigid chronological system, under which the facts\r of history might be arranged with certainty.**\r \r      * According to Delitzsch, the term _limu,_ or _limmu_, meant\r      at first any given period, then later more especially the\r      year during which a magistrate filled his office; in the\r      opinion of most other Assyriologists it referred to the\r      magistrate himself as eponymous archon.\r \r      ** The first list of _limmu_ was discovered by H. Rawlinson.\r      The portions which have been preserved extend from the year\r      893 to the year 666 B.C. without a break. In the periods\r      previous and subsequent to this we have only names scattered\r      here and there which it has not been possible to classify:\r      the earliest _limmu_ known at present flourished under\r      Rammân-nirâri I., and was named Mukhurilâni. Three different\r      versions of the canon have como down to us. In the most\r      important one the names of the eponymous officials are\r      written one after another without titles or any mention of\r      important events; in the other two, the titles of each\r      personage, and any important occurrences which took place\r      during his year of office, are entered after the name.\r \r The king still retained the sacerdotal attributes with which Cossæan\r monarchs had been invested from the earliest times, but contact with the\r Egyptians had modified the popular conception of his personality. His\r subjects were no longer satisfied to regard him merely as a man superior\r to his fellow-men; they had come to discover something of the divine\r nature in him, and sometimes identified him--not with Assur, the master\r of all things, who occupied a position too high above the pale of\r ordinary humanity--but with one of the demi-gods of the second rank,\r Shamash, the Sun, the deity whom the Pharaohs pretended to represent in\r flesh and blood here below. His courtiers, therefore, went as far as to\r call him Sun when they addressed him, and he himself adopted this title\r in his inscriptions.*\r \r      * Nebuchadrezzar I. of Babylon assumes the title of _Shamash\r      mati-shu_, the Sun of his country, and Hilprecht rightly\r      sees in this expression a trace of Egyptian influences;\r      later on, Assurnazirpal, King of Assyria similarly describes\r      himself as _Shamshu kishshat nishi_, the Sun of all\r      mankind. Tiele is of opinion that these expressions do not\r      necessarily point to any theory of the actual incarnation of\r      the god, as was the case in Egypt, but that they may be mere\r      rhetorical figures.\r \r Formerly he had only attained this apotheosis after death, later on he\r was permitted to aspire to it during his lifetime. The Chaldæans adopted\r the same attitude, and in both countries the royal authority shone with\r the borrowed lustre of divine omnipotence. With these exceptions life\r at court remained very much the same as it had been; at Nineveh, as at\r Babylon, we find harems filled with foreign princesses, who had either\r been carried off as hostages from the country of a defeated enemy, or\r amicably obtained from their parents. In time of war, the command of the\r troops and the dangers of the battle-field; in time of peace, a host\r of religious ceremonies and judicial or administrative duties, left but\r little leisure to the sovereign who desired to perform conscientiously\r all that was required of him. His chief amusement lay in the hunting of\r wild beasts: the majority of the princes who reigned over Assyria had a\r better right than even Amenôthes III. himself to boast of the hundreds\r of lions which they had slain. They set out on these hunting expeditions\r with quite a small army of charioteers and infantry, and were often away\r several days at a time, provided urgent business did not require their\r presence in the palace. They started their quarry with the help of large\r dogs, and followed it over hill and dale till they got within bowshot:\r if it was but slightly wounded and turned on them, they gave it the\r finishing stroke with their lances without dismounting.\r \r [Illustration: 178.jpg A LION-HUNT]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a bas-relief in the British Museum.\r \r Occasionally, however, they were obliged to follow their prey into\r places where horses could not easily penetrate; then a hand-to-hand\r conflict was inevitable. The lion would rise on its hind quarters and\r endeavour to lay its pursuer low with a stroke of its mighty paw, but\r only to fall pierced to the heart by his lance or sword.\r \r [Illustration: 179.jpg LION TRANSFIXED BY AN ARROW]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a bas-relief in the British Museum.\r \r This kind of encounter demanded great presence of mind and steadiness of\r hand; the Assyrians were, therefore, trained to it from their youth\r up, and no hunter was permitted to engage in these terrible encounters\r without long preliminary practice. Seeing the lion as they did so\r frequently, and at such close quarters, they came to know it quite as\r well as the Egyptians, and their sculptors reproduce it with a realism\r and technical skill which have been rarely equalled in modern times.\r But while the Theban artist generally represents it in an attitude of\r repose, the Assyrians prefer to show it in violent action in all the\r various attitudes which it assumes during a struggle, either crouching\r as it prepares to spring, or fully extended in the act of leaping;\r sometimes it rears into an upright position, with arched back, gaping\r jaws, and claws protruded, ready to bite or strike its foe; at others\r it writhes under a spear-thrust, or rolls over and over in its dying\r agonies. In one instance, an arrow has pierced the skull of a male lion,\r crashing through the frontal bone a little above the left eyebrow, and\r protrudes obliquely to the right between his teeth: under the shock of\r the blow he has risen on his hind legs, with contorted spine, and beats\r the air with his fore paws, his head thrown back as though to free\r himself of the fatal shaft. Not far from him the lioness lies stretched\r out upon its back in the rigidity of death.\r \r [Illustration: 180.jpg PAINTINGS OF CHAIRS]\r \r The rimu, or urus, was, perhaps, even a more formidable animal to\r encounter than any of the _felido_, owing to the irresistible fury of\r his attack. No one would dare, except in a case of dire necessity, to\r meet him on foot. The loose flowing robes which the king and the nobles\r never put aside--not even in such perilous pastimes as these--were ill\r fitted for the quick movements required to avoid the attack of such an\r animal, and those who were unlucky enough to quit their chariot ran a\r terrible risk of being gored or trodden underfoot in the encounter. It\r was the custom, therefore, to attack the beast by arrows, and to keep it\r at a distance. If the animal were able to come up with its pursuer, the\r latter endeavoured to seize it by the horn at the moment when it lowered\r its head, and to drive his dagger into its neck. If the blow were\r adroitly given it severed the spinal cord, and the beast fell in a heap\r as if struck by lightning. A victory over such animals was an occasion\r for rejoicing, and solemn thanks were offered to Assur and Ishtar, the\r patrons of the chase, at the usual evening sacrifice.\r \r [Illustration: 181.jpg A UBUS HUNT]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a bas-relief in the British Museum.\r \r The slain beasts, whether lion or urus, were arranged in a row\r before the altar, while the king, accompanied by his flabella, and\r umbrella-bearers, stood alongside them, holding his bow in his left\r hand. While the singers intoned the hymn of thanksgiving to the\r accompaniment of the harp, the monarch took the bowl of sacred wine,\r touched his lips with it, and then poured a portion of the contents on\r the heads of the victims. A detailed account of each hunting exploit was\r preserved for posterity either in inscriptions or on bas-reliefs.*\r \r      * In the _Annals of Tiglath-pileser I._ the king counts the\r      number of his victims: 4 urus, 10 male elephants, 120 lions\r      slain in single combat on foot, 800 lions killed by arrows\r      let fly from his chariot. In the _Annals of Assurnazirpal,_\r      the king boasts of having slain 30 elephants, 250 urus, and\r      370 lions.\r \r The chase was in those days of great service to the rural population;\r the kings also considered it to be one of the duties attached to their\r office, and on a level with their obligation to make war on neighbouring\r nations devoted by the will of Assur to defeat and destruction.\r \r [Illustration: 182.jpg LIBATION POURED OVER THE LIONS ON THE RETURN FROM\r THE CHASE]\r \r Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Hommel.\r \r The army charged to carry out the will of the god had not yet acquired\r the homogeneity and efficiency which it afterwards attained, yet it had\r been for some time one of the most formidable in the world, and even\r the Egyptians themselves, in spite of their long experience in military\r matters, could not put into the field such a proud array of effective\r troops. We do not know how this army was recruited, but the bulk of it\r was made up of native levies, to which foreign auxiliaries were added\r in numbers varying with the times.* A permanent nucleus of troops was\r always in garrison in the capital under the tartan, or placed in the\r principal towns at the disposal of the governors.**\r \r      * We have no bas-relief representing the armies of Tiglath-\r      pileser I. Everything in the description which follows is\r      taken from the monuments of Assurnazirpal and Shalmaneser\r      II., revised as far as possible by the inscriptions of\r      Tiglath-pileser; the armament of both infantry and chariotry\r      must have been practically the same in the two periods.\r \r      ** This is based on the account given in the Obelisk of\r      Shalmaneser, where the king, for example, after having\r      gathered his soldiers together at Kalakh [Calah], put at\r      their head Dainassur the artan, the master of his\r      innumerable troops.\r \r [Illustration: 183.jpg TWO ASSYRIAN ARCHERS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin.\r \r The contingents which came to be enrolled at these centres on the first\r rumour of war may have been taken from among the feudal militia, as was\r the custom in the Nile valley, or the whole population may have had to\r render personal military service, each receiving while with the colours\r a certain daily pay. The nobles and feudal lords were accustomed to call\r their own people together, and either placed themselves at their head or\r commissioned an officer to act in their behalf.*\r \r      * The assembling of foot-soldiers and chariots is often\r      described at the beginning of each campaign; the _Donation\r      of Bittimerodach_ brings before us a great feudal lord, who\r      leads his contingent to the King of Chaldæa, and anything\r      which took place among the Babylonians had its counterpart\r      among the Assyrians. Sometimes the king had need of all the\r      contingents, and then it was said he assembled the\r      country. Auxiliaries are mentioned, for example, in the\r      _Annals of Assurnazirpal_, col. iii. 11. 58-77, where the\r      king, in his passage, rallies one after the other the troops\r      of Bît-Bakhiâni, of Azalli, of Bît-Adini, of Garganish, and\r      of the Patinu.\r \r [Illustration: 184.jpg AN ASSYRIAN WAR-CHARIOT CHARGING THE FOE]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Mansell.\r \r These recruits were subjected to the training necessary for their\r calling by exercises similar to those of the Egyptians, but of a rougher\r sort and better adapted to the cumbrous character of their equipment.\r The blacksmiths art had made such progress among the Assyrians since\r the times of Thûtmosis III. and Ramses IL, that both the character and\r the materials of the armour were entirely changed.\r \r [Illustration: 185a.jpg HARNESS OF THE HORSES]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from G. Rawlinson.\r \r [Illustration: 185b.jpg PIKEMAN]\r \r While the Egyptian of old entered into the contest almost naked, and\r without other defence than a padded cap, a light shield, and a leather\r apron, the Assyrian of the new age set out for war almost cased in\r metal. The pikemen and archers of whom the infantry of the line was\r composed wore a copper or iron helmet, conical in form, and having\r cheek-pieces covering the ears; they were clad in a sort of leathern\r shirt covered with plates or imbricated scales of metal, which protected\r the body and the upper part of the arm; a quilted and padded loin-cloth\r came over the haunches, while close-fitting trousers, and buskins laced\r up in the front, completed their attire. The pikemen were armed with a\r lance six feet long, a cutlass or short sword passed through the girdle,\r and an enormous shield, sometimes round and convex, sometimes arched at\r the top and square at the bottom. The bowmen did not encumber themselves\r with a buckler, but carried, in addition to the bow and quiver,\r a poignard or mace. The light infantry consisted of pikemen and\r archers--each of whom wore a crested helmet and a round shield of\r wicker-work--of slingers and club-bearers, as well as of men armed with\r the two-bladed battle-axe. The chariots were heavier and larger than\r those of the Egyptians. They had high, strongly made wheels with eight\r spokes, and the body of the vehicle rested directly on the axle; the\r panels were of solid wood, sometimes covered with embossed or carved\r metal, but frequently painted; they were further decorated sometimes\r with gold, silver, or ivory mountings, and with precious stones. The\r pole, which was long and heavy, ended in a boss of carved wood or\r incised metal, representing a flower, a rosette, the muzzle of a lion,\r or a horses head. It was attached to the axle under the floor of the\r vehicle, and as it had to bear a great strain, it was not only fixed to\r this point by leather thongs such as were employed in Egypt, but also\r bound to the front of the chariot by a crossbar shaped like a spindle,\r and covered with embroidered stuff--an arrangement which prevented its\r becoming detached when driving at full speed. A pair of horses were\r harnessed to it, and a third was attached to them on the right side\r for the use of a supplementary warrior, who could take the place of his\r comrade in case of accident, or if he were wounded. The trappings were\r very simple; but sometimes there was added to these a thickly padded\r caparison, of which the various parts were fitted to the horse by tags\r so as to cover the upper part of his head, his neck, back, and breast.\r The usual complement of charioteers was two to each vehicle, as in\r Egypt, but sometimes, as among the Khâti, there were three--one on the\r left to direct the horses, a warrior, and an attendant who protected the\r other two with his shield; on some occasions a fourth was added as an\r extra assistant. The equipment of the charioteers was like that of the\r infantry, and consisted of a jacket with imbricated scales of metal,\r bow and arrows, and a lance or javelin. A standard which served as a\r rallying-point for the chariots in the battle was set up on the front\r part of each vehicle, between the driver and the warrior; it bore at\r the top a disk supported on the heads of two bulls, or by two complete\r representations of these animals, and a standing figure of Assur letting\r fly his arrows. The chariotry formed, as in most countries of that time,\r the picked troops of the service, in which the princes and great lords\r were proud to be enrolled. Upon it depended for the most part the issue\r of the conflict, and the position assigned to it was in the van,\r the king or commander-in-chief reserving to himself the privilege of\r conducting the charge in person. It was already, however, in a state\r of decadence, both as regards the number of units composing it and its\r methods of manoeuvring; the infantry, on the other hand, had increased\r in numbers, and under the guidance of abler generals tended to become\r the most trustworthy force in Assyrian campaigns.*\r \r      * Tiglath-pileser is seen, for instance, setting out on a\r      campaign in a mountainous country with only thirty chariots.\r \r Notwithstanding the weight of his equipment, the Assyrian foot-soldier\r was as agile as the Egyptian, but he had to fight usually in a much more\r difficult region than that in which the Pharaohs troops were accustomed\r to manouvre.\r \r [Illustration: 188.jpg CROSSING A RIVER IN BOATS AND ON INFLATED SKINS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.\r \r The theatre of war was not like Syria, with its fertile and almost\r unbroken plains furrowed by streams which offered little obstruction\r to troops throughout the year, but a land of marshes, arid and rocky\r deserts, mighty rivers, capable, in one of their sudden floods, of\r arresting progress for days, and of jeopardising the success of a\r campaign;* violent and ice-cold torrents, rugged mountains whose summits\r rose into points like daggers, and whose passes could be held against\r a host of invaders by a handful of resolute men.**\r \r      * Sennacherib was obliged to arrest his march against Elam,\r      owing to his inability to cross the torrents swollen by the\r      rain; a similar contretemps must have met Assurbanipal on\r      the banks of the Ididi.\r \r      ** The Assyrian monarchs dwell with pleasure on the\r      difficulties of the country which they have to overcome.\r \r Bands of daring skirmishers, consisting of archers, slingers, and\r pikemen, cleared the way for the mass of infantry marching in columns,\r and for the chariots, in the midst of which the king and his household\r took up their station; the baggage followed, together with the prisoners\r and their escorts.*\r \r      * Assurbanipal relates, for instance, that he put under his\r      escort a tribe which had surrendered themselves as\r      prisoners.\r \r If they came to a river where there was neither ford nor bridge, they\r were not long in effecting a passage.\r \r [Illustration: 189.jpg MAKING A BRIDGE FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE CHARIOTS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief on the bronze\r      gates of Balawât.\r \r Each soldier was provided with a skin, which, having inflated it by the\r strength of his lungs and closed the aperture, he embraced in his arms\r and cast himself into the stream. Partly by floating and partly by\r swimming, a whole regiment could soon reach the other side. The chariots\r could not be carried over so easily.\r \r [Illustration: 190.jpg THE KINGS CHARIOT CROSSING A BRIDGE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the\r      bronze gates of Balawât.\r \r If the bed of the river was not very wide, and the current not too\r violent, a narrow bridge was constructed, or rather an improvised dyke\r of large stones and rude gabions filled with clay, over which was spread\r a layer of branches and earth, supplying a sufficiently broad passage\r for a single chariot, of which the horses were led across at walking\r pace.*\r \r      * Flying bridges, _tîturâti_, were mentioned as far back as\r      the time of Tiglath-pileser I.\r \r But when the distance between the banks was too great, and the stream\r too violent to allow of this mode of procedure, boats were requisitioned\r from the neighbourhood, on which men and chariots were embarked, while\r the horses, attended by grooms, or attached by their bridles to the\r flotilla, swam across the river.* If the troops had to pass through a\r mountainous district intersected by ravines and covered by forests, and\r thus impracticable on ordinary occasions for a large body of men, the\r advance-guard were employed in cutting a passage through the trees\r with the axe, and, if necessary, in making with the pick pathways\r or rough-hewn steps similar to those met with in the Lebanon on the\r Phoenician coast.**\r \r      * It was in this manner that Tiglath-pileser I. crossed the\r      Euphrates on his way to the attack of Carchemish.\r \r      ** Tiglath-pileser I. speaks on several occasions, and not\r      without pride, of the roads that he had made for himself\r      with bronze hatchets through the forests and over the\r      mountains.\r \r [Illustration: 191.jpg THE ASSYRIAN INFANTRY CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS]\r \r Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief on the bronze gates of\r Balawât.\r \r The troops advanced in narrow columns, sometimes even in single file,\r along these improvised roads, always on the alert lest they should be\r taken at a disadvantage by an enemy concealed in the thickets. In case\r of attack, the foot-soldiers had each to think of himself, and endeavour\r to give as many blows as he received; but the charioteers, encumbered\r by their vehicles and the horses, found it no easy matter to extricate\r themselves from the danger. Once the chariots had entered into the\r forest region, the driver descended from his vehicle, and led the horses\r by the head, while the warrior and his assistant were not slow to follow\r his example, in order to give some relief to the animals by tugging at\r the wheels. The king alone did not dismount, more out of respect for his\r dignity than from indifference to the strain upon the animals; for, in\r spite of careful leading, he had to submit to a rough shaking from the\r inequalities of this rugged soil; sometimes he had too much of this, and\r it is related of him in his annals that he had crossed the mountains on\r foot like an ordinary mortal.*\r \r      * The same fact is found in the accounts of every\r      expedition, but more importance is attached to it as we\r      approach the end of the Ninevite empire, when the kings were\r      not so well able to endure hardship. Sennacherib mentions it\r      on several occasions, with a certain amount of self-pity for\r      the fatigue he had undergone, but with a real pride in his\r      own endurance.\r \r A halt was made every evening, either at some village, whose inhabitants\r were obliged to provide food and lodging, or, in default of this, on\r some site which they could fortify by a hastily thrown up rampart of\r earth. If they were obliged to remain in any place for a length of time,\r a regular encircling wall was constructed, not square or rectangular\r like those of the Egyptians, but round or oval.*\r \r      * The oval inclines towards a square form, with rounded\r      corners, on the bas-reliefs of the bronze gates of\r      Shalmaneser II. at Balawât.\r \r [Illustration: 193.jpg THE KING CROSSING A MOUNTAIN IN HIS CHARIOT]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Mansell, taken in the\r      British Museum.\r \r It was made of dried brick, and provided with towers like an ancient\r city; indeed, many of these entrenched camps survived the occasion of\r their formation, and became small fortified towns or castles, whence a\r permanent garrison could command the neighbouring country. The interior\r was divided into four equal parts by two roads, intersecting each other\r at right angles. The royal tents, with their walls of felt or brown\r linen, resembled an actual palace, which could be moved from place to\r place; they were surrounded with less pretentious buildings reserved for\r the kings household, and the stables.\r \r [Illustration: 194.jpg AN ASSYRIAN CAMP]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from Layard.\r \r The tent-poles at the angles of these habitations were plated with\r metal, and terminated at their upper extremities in figures of goats and\r other animals made of the same material. The tents of the soldiers, were\r conical in form, and each was maintained in its position by a forked\r pole placed inside. They contained the ordinary requirements of the\r peasant---bed and head-rest, table with legs like those of a gazelle,\r stools and folding-chairs; the household utensils and the provisions\r hung from the forks of the support. The monuments, which usually\r give few details of humble life, are remarkable for their complete\r reproductions of the daily scenes in the camp. We see on them, the\r soldier making his bed, grinding corn, dressing the carcase of a sheep,\r which he had just killed, or pouring out wine; the pot boiling on the\r fire is watched by the vigilant eye of a trooper or of a woman, while\r those not actively employed are grouped together in twos and threes,\r eating, drinking, and chatting. A certain number of priests and\r soothsayers accompanied the army, but they did not bring the statues of\r their gods with them, the only emblems of the divinities seen in battle\r being the two royal ensigns, one representing Assur as lord of the\r territory, borne on a single bull and bending his bow, while the other\r depicted him standing on two bulls as King of Assyria.* An altar smoked\r before the chariot on which these two standards were planted, and every\r night and morning the prince and his nobles laid offerings upon it, and\r recited prayers before it for the well-being of the army.\r \r Military tactics had not made much progress since the time of the great\r Egyptian invasions. The Assyrian generals set out in haste from Nineveh\r or Assur in the hope of surprising their enemy, and they often succeeded\r in penetrating into the very heart of his country before he had time\r to mobilise or concentrate his forces. The work of subduing him was\r performed piecemeal; they devastated his fields, robbed his orchards,\r and, marching all through the night,** they would arrive with such\r suddenness before one or other of his towns, that he would have no time\r to organise a defence. Most of their campaigns were mere forced marches\r across plains and mountains, without regular sieges or pitched battles.\r \r      * It is possible that each of these standards corresponded\r      to some dignity of the sovereign; the first belonged to him,\r      inasmuch as he was _shar kishshati,_ king of the regions,\r       and the other, by virtue of his office, of _shar Ashshur_,\r      King of Assyria.\r \r      ** Assurnazirpal mentions several night marches, which\r      enabled him to reach the heart of the enemys country.\r \r [Illustration: 196.jpg A FORTIFIED TOWN]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Mansell. The\r      inhabitants of the town who have been taken prisoners, are\r      leaving it with their cattle under the conduct of Assyrian\r      soldiers.\r \r Should the enemy, however, seek an engagement, and the men be drawn up\r in line to meet him, the action would be opened by archers and light\r troops armed with slings, who would be followed by the chariotry and\r heavy infantry for close attack; a reserve of veterans would await\r around the commanding-general the crucial moment of the engagement, when\r they would charge in a body among the combatants, and decide the victory\r by sheer strength of arm.*\r \r      * Tiglath-pileser I. mentions a pitched battle against the\r      Muskhu, who numbered 20,000 men; and another against\r      Kiliteshub, King of Kummukh, in his first campaign. In one\r      of the following campaigns he overcame the people of Saraush\r      and those of Maruttash, and also 6000 Sugi; later on he\r      defeated 23 allied kings of Naîri, and took from them 120\r      chariots and 20,000 people of Kumanu. The other wars are\r      little more than raids, during which he encountered merely\r      those who were incapable of offering him any resistance.\r \r The pursuit of the enemy was never carried to any considerable distance,\r for the men were needed to collect the spoil, despatch the wounded, and\r carry off the trophies of war. Such of the prisoners as it was deemed\r useful or politic to spare were stationed in a safe place under a guard\r of sentries. The remainder were condemned to death as they were brought\r in, and their execution took place without delay; they were made to\r kneel down, with their backs to the soldiery, their heads bowed, and\r their hands resting on a flat stone or a billet of wood, in which\r position they were despatched with clubs. The scribes, standing before\r their tent doors, registered the number of heads cut off; each soldier,\r bringing his quota and throwing it upon the heap, gave in his name and\r the number of his company, and then withdrew in the hope of receiving a\r reward proportionate to the number of his victims.*\r \r      * The details of this bringing of heads are known to us by\r      representations of a later period. The allusions contained\r      in the _Annals of Tiglath-pileser I_. show that the custom\r      was in full force under the early Assyrian conquerors.\r \r When the king happened to accompany the army, he always presided at this\r scene, and distributed largesse to those who had shown most bravery; in\r his absence he required that the heads of the enemys chiefs should be\r sent to him, in order that they might be exposed to his subjects on the\r gates of his capital. Sieges were lengthy and arduous undertakings. In\r the case of towns situated on the plain, the site was usually chosen\r so as to be protected by canals, or an arm of a river on two or three\r sides, thus leaving one side only without a natural defence, which the\r inhabitants endeavoured to make up for by means of double or treble\r ramparts.*\r \r      * The town of Tela had three containing walls, that of\r      Shingisha had four, and that of Pitura two.\r \r [Illustration: 198.jpg THE BRINGING OF HEADS AFTER A BATTLE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.\r \r These fortifications must have resembled those of the Syrian towns; the\r walls were broad at the base, and, to prevent scaling, rose to a height\r of some thirty or forty feet: there were towers at intervals of a\r bowshot, from which the archers could seriously disconcert parties\r making attacks against any intervening points in the curtain wall; the\r massive gates were covered with raw hides, or were plated with metal\r to resist assaults by fire and axe, while, as soon as hostilities\r commenced, the defence was further completed by wooden scaffolding.\r Places thus fortified, however, at times fell almost without an attempt\r at resistance; the inhabitants, having descended into the lowlands to\r rescue their crops from the Assyrians, would be disbanded, and, while\r endeavouring to take refuge within their ramparts, would be pursued by\r the enemy, who would gain admittance with them in the general disorder.\r If the town did not fall into their hands by some stroke of good\r fortune, they would at once attempt, by an immediate assault, to terrify\r the garrison into laying down their arms.*\r \r      * Assurnazirpal, in this fashion, took the town of Pitura in\r      two days, in spite of its strong double ramparts.\r \r The archers and slingers led the attack by advancing in couples till\r they were within the prescribed distance from the walls, one of the two\r taking careful aim, while the other sheltered his comrade behind his\r round-topped shield. The king himself would sometimes alight from his\r chariot and let fly his arrows in the front rank of the archers, while\r a handful of resolute men would rush against the gates of the town\r and attempt either to break them down or set them alight with torches.\r Another party, armed with stout helmets and quilted jerkins, which\r rendered them almost invulnerable to the shower of arrows or stones\r poured on them by the besieged, would attempt to undermine the walls by\r means of levers and pick-axes, and while thus engaged would be protected\r by mantelets fixed to the face of the walls, resembling in shape the\r shields of the archers. Often bodies of men would approach the suburbs\r of the city and endeavour to obtain access to the ramparts from the\r roofs of the houses in close proximity to the walls. If, however,\r they could gain admittance by none of these means, and time was of no\r consideration, they would resign themselves to a lengthy siege, and the\r blockade would commence by a systematic desolation of the surrounding\r country, in which the villages scattered over the plain would be burnt,\r the vines torn up, and all trees cut down.\r \r [Illustration: 200.jpg THE KING LETS FLY ARROWS AT A BESIEGED TOWN]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.\r \r The Assyrians waged war with a brutality which the Egyptians would never\r have tolerated. Unlike the Pharaohs, their kings were not content to\r imprison or put to death the principal instigators of a revolt, but\r their wrath would fall upon the entire population. As long as a town\r resisted the efforts of their besieging force, all its inhabitants\r bearing arms who fell into their hands were subjected to the most cruel\r tortures; they were cut to pieces or impaled alive on stakes, which were\r planted in the ground just in front of the lines, so that the besieged\r should enjoy a full view of the sufferings of their comrades.\r \r [Illustration: 201.jpg ASSYRIAN SAPPERS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.\r \r Even during the course of a short siege this line of stakes would\r be prolonged till it formed a bloody pale between the two contending\r armies. This horrible spectacle had at least the effect of shaking the\r courage of the besieged, and of hastening the end of hostilities. When\r at length the town yielded to the enemy, it was often razed to the\r ground, and salt was strewn upon its ruins, while the unfortunate\r inhabitants were either massacred or transplanted _en masse_ elsewhere.\r If the bulk of the population were spared and condemned to exile, the\r wealthy and noble were shown no clemency; they were thrown from, the top\r of the city towers, their ears and noses were cut off, their hands and\r feet were amputated, or they and their children were roasted over a slow\r fire, or flayed alive, or decapitated, and their heads piled up in a\r heap.\r \r [Illustration: 202.jpg A TOWN TAKEN BY SCALING]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs of the\r      bronze gate at Balawât. The two soldiers who represent the\r      Assyrian army carry their shields before them; flames appear\r      above the ramparts, showing that the conquerors have burnt\r      the town.\r \r The victorious sovereigns appear to have taken a pride in the\r ingenuity with which they varied these means of torture, and dwell with\r complacency on the recital of their cruelties. I constructed a pillar\r at the gate of the city, is the boast of one of them; I then flayed\r the chief men, and covered the post with their skins; I suspended their\r dead bodies from this same pillar, I impaled others on the summit of the\r pillar, and I ranged others on stakes around the pillar.\r \r Two or three executions of this kind usually sufficed to demoralise the\r enemy. The remaining inhabitants assembled: terrified by the majesty of\r Assur, and as it were blinded by the brightness of his countenance, they\r sunk down at the knees of the victor and embraced his feet.*\r \r      * These are the very expressions used in the Assyrian texts:\r      The terror of my strength overthrew them, they feared the\r      combat, and they embraced my feet; and again: The\r      brightness of Assur, my lord, overturned them. This latter\r      image is explained by the presence over the king of the\r      winged figure of Assur directing the battle.\r \r [Illustration: 203.jpg TORTURES INFLICTED ON PRISONERS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs of the\r      bronze gates of Balawât; on the right the town is seen in\r      flames, and on the walls on either side hangs a row of\r      heads, one above another.\r \r The peace secured at the price of their freedom left them merely with\r their lives and such of their goods as could not be removed from the\r soil. The scribes thereupon surrounded the spoil seized by the soldiery\r and drew up a detailed inventory of the prisoners and their property:\r everything worth carrying away to Assyria was promptly registered, and\r despatched to the capital.\r \r [Illustration: 204.jpg A CONVOY OF PRISONERS AND CAPTIVES AFTER THE\r TAKING OF A TOWN]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher Gudin, from Layard.\r \r The contents of the royal palace led the way; it comprised the silver,\r gold, and copper of the vanquished prince, his caldrons, dishes and\r cups of brass, the women of his harem, the maidens of his household,\r his furniture and stuffs, horses and chariots, together with his men\r and women servants. The enemys gods, like his kings, were despoiled\r of their possessions, and poor and rich suffered alike. The choicest of\r their troops were incorporated into the Assyrian regiments, and helped\r to fill the gaps which war had made in the ranks;* the peasantry and\r townsfolk were sold as slaves, or were despatched with their families to\r till the domains of the king in some Assyrian village.* Tiglath-pileser\r I. in this manner incorporated 120 chariots of the Kashki and the Urumi\r into the Assyrian chariotry.\r \r [Illustration: 205.jpg CONVOY OF PRISONERS BOUND IN VARIOUS WAYS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief of one of the\r      gates of Balawât.\r \r The monuments often depict the exodus of these unfortunate wretches.\r They were represented as proceeding on their way in the charge of a few\r foot-soldiers--each of the men carrying, without any sign of labour, a\r bag of provisions, while the women bear their young children on their\r shoulders or in their arms: herds of cows and flocks of goats and sheep\r follow, chariots drawn by mules bringing up the rear with the baggage.\r While the crowd of non-combatants were conducted in irregular columns\r without manacles or chains, the veteran troops and the young men capable\r of bearing arms were usually bound together, and sometimes were further\r secured by a wooden collar placed on their necks. Many perished on the\r way from want or fatigue, but such as were fortunate enough to reach\r the end of the journey were rewarded with a small portion of land and\r a dwelling, becoming henceforward identified with the indigenous\r inhabitants of the country. Assyrians were planted as colonists in the\r subjugated towns, and served to maintain there the authority of the\r conqueror. The condition of the latter resembled to a great extent that\r of the old Egyptian vassals in Phoenicia or Southern Syria. They were\r allowed to retain their national constitution, rites, and even their\r sovereigns; when, for instance, after some rebellion, one of these\r princes had been impaled or decapitated, his successor was always chosen\r from among the members of his own family, usually one of his sons, who\r was enthroned almost before his father had ceased to breathe. He was\r obliged to humiliate his own gods before Assur, to pay a yearly tribute,\r to render succour in case of necessity to the commanders of neighbouring\r garrisons, to send his troops when required to swell the royal army, to\r give his sons or brothers as hostages, and to deliver up his own sisters\r and daughters, or those of his nobles, for the harem or the domestic\r service of the conqueror. The unfortunate prince soon resigned himself\r to this state of servitude; he would collect around him and reorganise\r his scattered subjects, restore them to their cities, rebuild their\r walls, replant the wasted orchards, and sow the devastated fields. A few\r years of relative peace and tranquillity, during which he strove to\r be forgotten by his conqueror, restored prosperity to his country; the\r population increased with extraordinary rapidity, and new generations\r arose who, unconscious of the disasters suffered by their predecessors,\r had, but one aim, that of recovering their independence. We must,\r however, beware of thinking that the defeat of these tribes was as\r crushing or their desolation as terrible as the testimony of the\r inscriptions would lead us to suppose. The rulers of Nineveh were but\r too apt to relate that this or that country had been conquered and its\r people destroyed, when the Assyrian army had remained merely a week or\r a fortnight within its territory, had burnt some half-dozen fortified\r towns, and taken two or three thousand prisoners.*\r \r      * For example, Tiglath-pileser I. conquers the Kummukli in\r      the first year of his reign, burning, destroying, and\r      depopulating the towns, and massacring the remainder of the\r      Kummukh who had taken refuge in the mountains, after which,\r      in his second campaign, he again pillages, burns, destroys,\r      and depopulates the towns, and again massacres the remainder\r      of the inhabitants hiding in the mountains. He makes the\r      same statements with regard to most of the other countries\r      and peoples conquered by him, but we find them reappearing\r      with renewed vigour on the scene, soon after their supposed\r      destruction.\r \r If we were to accept implicitly all that is recorded of the Assyrian\r exploits in Naîri or the Taurus, we should be led to believe that for\r at least half a century the valleys of the Upper Tigris and Middle\r Euphrates were transformed into a desert; each time, however, that they\r are subsequently mentioned on the occasion of some fresh expedition,\r they appear once more covered with thriving cities and a vigorous\r population, whose generals offer an obstinate resistance to the\r invaders. We are, therefore, forced to admit that the majority of these\r expeditions must be regarded as mere raids. The population, disconcerted\r by a sudden attack, would take refuge in the woods or on the mountains,\r carrying with them their gods, whom they thus preserved from captivity,\r together with a portion of their treasures and cattle; but no sooner had\r the invader retired, than they descended once more into the plain and\r returned to their usual occupations. The Assyrian victories thus rarely\r produced the decisive results which are claimed for them; they almost\r always left the conquered people with sufficient energy and resources\r to enable them to resume the conflict after a brief interval, and the\r supremacy which the suzerain claimed as a result of his conquests was of\r the most ephemeral nature. A revolt would suffice to shake it, while a\r victory would be almost certain to destroy it, and once more reduce the\r empire to the limits of Assyria proper.\r \r Tukultiabalesharra, familiar to us under the name of Tiglath-pileser,*\r is the first of the great warrior-kings of Assyria to stand out before\r us with any definite individuality.\r \r      * Tiglath-pileser is one of the transcriptions given in the\r      LXX. for the Hebrew version of the name: it signifies, The\r      child of Esharra is my strength. By the child of Esharra\r       the Assyrians, like the Chaldæans, understood the child of\r      Ninib.\r \r We find him, in the interval between two skirmishes, engaged in hunting\r lions or in the pursuit of other wild beasts, and we see him lavishing\r offerings on the gods and enriching their temples with the spoils of\r his victories; these, however, were not the normal occupations of this\r sovereign, for peace with him was merely an interlude in a reign of\r conflict. He led all his expeditions in person, undeterred by any\r consideration of fatigue or danger, and scarcely had he returned from\r one arduous campaign, than he proceeded to sketch the plan of that for\r the following year; in short, he reigned only to wage war. His father,\r Assurîshishi, had bequeathed him not only a prosperous kingdom, but a\r well-organised army, which he placed in the field without delay. During\r the fifty years since the Mushku, descending through the gorges of the\r Taurus, had invaded the Alzi and the Puru-kuzzi, Assyria had not only\r lost possession of all the countries bordering the left bank of the\r Euphrates, but the whole of Kummukh had withdrawn its allegiance from\r her, and had ceased to pay tribute. Tiglath-pileser had ascended the\r throne only a few weeks ere he quitted Assur, marched rapidly across\r Eastern Mesopotamia by the usual route, through Singar and Nisib, and\r climbing the chain of the Kashiara, near Mardîn, bore down into the very\r heart of Kummukh, where twenty thousand Mushku, under the command of\r five kings, resolutely awaited him. He repulsed them in the very first\r engagement, and pursued them hotly over hill and vale, pillaging the\r fields, and encircling the towns with trophies of human heads taken\r from the prisoners who had fallen into his hands; the survivors, to the\r number of six thousand, laid down their arms, and were despatched to\r Assyria.*\r \r      * The king, starting from Assur, must have followed the\r      route through Sindjar, Nisib, Mardîn, and Diarbekîr--a road\r      used later by the Romans, and still in existence at the\r      present day. As he did not penetrate that year as far as the\r      provinces of Alzi and Purukuzzi, he must have halted at the\r      commencement of the mountain district, and have beaten the\r      allies in the plain of Kuru-tchaî, before Diarbekîr, in the\r      neighbourhood of the Tigris.\r \r The Kummukh contingents, however, had been separated in the rout from\r the Mushku, and had taken refuge beyond the Euphrates, near to the\r fortress of Shirisha, where they imagined themselves in safety behind a\r rampart of mountains and forests. Tiglath-pileser managed, by cutting\r a road for his foot-soldiers and chariots, to reach their retreat: he\r stormed the place without apparent difficulty, massacred the defenders,\r and then turning upon the inhabitants of Kurkhi,* who were on their way\r to reinforce the besieged, drove their soldiers into the Nâmi, whose\r waters carried the corpses down to the Tigris. One of their princes,\r Kilite-shub, son of Kaliteshub-Sarupi, had been made prisoner during\r the action. Tiglath-pileser sent him, together with his wives, children,\r treasures, and gods,** to share the captivity of the Mushku; then\r retracing his steps, he crossed over to the right bank of the Tigris,\r and attacked the stronghold of Urrakhinas which crowned the summit of\r Panâri.\r \r      * The country of the Kurkhi appears to have included at this\r      period the provinces lying between the Sebbeneh-Su and the\r      mountains of Djudî, probably a portion of the Sophene, the\r      Anzanone and the Gordyenc of classical authors.\r \r      ** The vanquished must have crossed the Tigris below\r      Diarbekîr and have taken refuge beyond Mayafarrikîn, so that\r      Shirisha must be sought for between the Silvan-dagh and the\r      Ak-dagh, in the basin of the Batman-tchai, the present Nâmi.\r \r The people, terror-stricken by the fate of their neighbours, seized\r their idols and hid themselves within the thickets like a flock of\r birds. Their chief, Shaditeshub, son of Khâtusaru,* ventured from out of\r his hiding-place to meet the Assyrian conqueror, and prostrated himself\r at his feet. He delivered over his sons and the males of his family\r as hostages, and yielded up all his possessions in gold and copper,\r together with a hundred and twenty slaves and cattle of all kinds;\r Tiglath-pileser thereupon permitted him to keep his principality under\r the suzerainty of Assyria, and such of his allies as followed his\r example obtained a similar concession. The king consecrated the tenth\r of the spoil thus received to the use of his god Assur and also to\r Rammân;** but before returning to his capital, he suddenly resolved to\r make an expedition into the almost impenetrable regions which separated\r him from Lake Van.\r \r      * The name of this chiefs father has always been read\r      Khâtukhi: it is a form of the name Khâtusaru borne by the\r      Hittite king in the time of Ramses II.\r \r      ** The site of Urrakhinas--read by Winckler Urartinas--is\r      very uncertain: the town was situated in a territory which\r      could belong equally well to the Kummukh or to the Kurkhi,\r      and the mention of the crossing of the Tigris seems to\r      indicate that it was on the right bank of the river,\r      probably in the mountain group of Tur-Abdîn.\r \r This district was, even more than at the present day, a confused\r labyrinth of wooded mountain ranges, through which the Eastern Tigris\r and its affluents poured their rapid waters in tortuous curves. As\r hitherto no army had succeeded in making its way through this territory\r with sufficient speed to surprise the fortified villages and scattered\r clans inhabiting the valleys and mountain slopes, Tiglath-pileser\r selected from his force a small troop of light infantry and thirty\r chariots, with which he struck into the forests; but, on reaching the\r Aruma, he was forced to abandon his chariotry and proceed with the\r foot-soldiers only. The Mildîsh, terrified by his sudden appearance,\r fell an easy prey to the invader; the king scattered the troops hastily\r collected to oppose him, set fire to a few fortresses, seized the\r peasantry and their flocks, and demanded hostages and the usual tribute\r as a condition of peace.*\r \r      * The Mildîsh of our inscription is to be identified with\r      the country of Mount Umildîsh, mentioned by Sargon of\r      Assyria.\r \r In his first campaign he thus reduced the upper and eastern half of\r Kummukh, namely, the part extending to the north of the Tigris, while in\r the following campaign he turned his attention to the regions bounded by\r the Euphrates and by the western spurs of the Kashiari. The Alzi and the\r Purukuzzi had been disconcerted by his victories, and had yielded him\r their allegiance almost without a struggle. To the southward, the Kashku\r and the Urumi, who had, to the number of four thousand, migrated from\r among the Khâti and compelled the towns of the Shubarti to break their\r alliance with the Ninevite kings, now made no attempt at resistance;\r they laid down their arms and yielded at discretion, giving up\r their goods and their hundred and twenty war-chariots, and resigning\r themselves to the task of colonising a distant corner of Assyria. Other\r provinces, however, were not so easily dealt with; the inhabitants\r entrenched themselves within their wild valleys, from whence they had\r to be ousted by sheer force; in the end they always had to yield, and to\r undertake to pay an annual tribute. The Assyrian empire thus regained\r on this side the countries which Shalmaneser I. had lost, owing to the\r absorption of his energies and interests in the events which were taking\r place in Chaldæa.\r \r In his third campaign Tiglath-pileser succeeded in bringing about the\r pacification of the border provinces which shut in the basin of the\r Tigris to the north and east. The Kurkhi did not consider themselves\r conquered by the check they had received at the Nâmi; several of their\r tribes were stirring in Kharia, on the highlands above the Arzania, and\r their restlessness threatened to infect such of their neighbours as\r had already submitted themselves to the Assyrian yoke. My master Assur\r commanded me to attack their proud summits, which no king has ever\r visited. I assembled my chariots and my foot-soldiers, and I\r passed between the Idni and the Ala, by a difficult country, across\r cloud-capped mountains whose peaks were as the point of a dagger,\r and unfavourable to the progress of my chariots; I therefore left my\r chariots in reserve, and I climbed these steep mountains. The community\r of the Kurkhi assembled its numerous troops, and in order to give me\r battle they entrenched themselves upon the Azubtagish; on the slopes of\r the mountain, an incommodious position, I came into conflict with\r them, and I vanquished them. This lesson cost them twenty-five towns,\r situated at the feet of the Aîa, the Shuîra, the Idni, the Shizu, the\r Silgu, and the Arzanabiu*--all twenty-five being burnt to the ground.\r \r      * The site of Kharia must be sought for probably between the\r      sources of the Tigris and the Batman-tchaî.\r \r The dread of a similar fate impelled the neighbouring inhabitants of\r Adaush to beg for a truce, which was granted to them;* but the people of\r Saraush and of Ammaush, who from all time had never known what it was\r to obey, were cut to pieces, and their survivors incorporated into the\r empire--a like fate overtaking the Isua and the Daria, who inhabited\r Khoatras.**\r \r      * According to the context, the Adaush ought to be between\r      the Kharia and the Saraush; possibly between the Batman-\r      tchaî and the Bohtân-tchaî, in the neighbourhood of Mildîsh.\r \r      ** As Tiglath-pileser was forced to cross Mount Aruma in\r      order to reach the Ammaush and the Saraush, these two\r      countries, together with Isua and Daria, cannot be far from\r      Mildîsh; Isua is, indeed, mentioned as near to Anzitene in\r      an inscription of Shalmaneser II., which obliges us to place\r      it somewhere near the sources of the Batman-tchaî. The\r      position of Muraddash and Saradaush is indirectly pointed\r      out by the mention of the Lower Zab and the Lulumê; the name\r      of Saradaush is perhaps preserved in that of Surtash, borne\r      by the valley through which runs one of the tributaries of\r      the Lower Zab.\r \r Beyond this, again, on the banks of the Lesser Zab and the confines of\r Lulumô, the principalities of Muraddash and of Saradaush refused to come\r to terms. Tiglath-pileser broke their lines within sight of Muraddash,\r and entered the town with the fugitives in the confusion which ensued;\r this took place about the fourth hour of the day. The success was so\r prompt and complete, that the king was inclined to attribute it to the\r help of Rammân, and he made an offering to the temple of this god at\r Assur of all the copper, whether wrought or in ore, which was found\r among the spoil of the vanquished. He was recalled almost immediately\r after this victory by a sedition among the Kurkhi near the sources of\r the Tigris. One of their tribes, known as the Sugi, who had not as\r yet suffered from the invaders, had concentrated round their standards\r contingents from some half-dozen cities, and the united force was, to\r the number of six thousand, drawn up on Mount Khirikhâ. Tiglath-pileser\r was again victorious, and took from them twenty-five statues of their\r gods, which he despatched to Assyria to be distributed among the\r sanctuaries of Belît at Assur, of Anu, Bammân, and of Ishtar. Winter\r obliged him to suspend operations. When he again resumed them at the\r beginning of his third year, both the Kummukh and the Kurkhi were so\r peaceably settled that he was able to carry his expeditions without fear\r of danger further north, into the regions of the Upper Euphrates between\r the Halys and Lake Van, a district then known as Naîri. He marched\r diagonally across the plain of Diarbekîr, penetrated through dense\r forests, climbed sixteen mountain ridges one after the other by paths\r hitherto considered impracticable, and finally crossed the Euphrates by\r improvised bridges, this being, as far as we know, the first time that\r an Assyrian monarch had ventured into the very heart of those countries\r which had formerly constituted the Hittite empire.\r \r He found them occupied by rude and warlike tribes, who derived\r considerable wealth from working the mines, and possessed each their\r own special sanctuary, the ruins of which still appear above ground,\r and invite the attention of the explorer. Their fortresses must have all\r more or less resembled that city of the Pterians which flourished for so\r many ages just at the bend of the Halys;* its site is still marked by\r a mound rising to some thirty feet above the plain, resembling the\r platforms on which the Chaldæan temples were always built--a few walls\r of burnt brick, and within an enclosure, among the débris of rudely\r built houses, the ruins of some temples and palaces consisting of large\r irregular blocks of stone.\r \r      * The remains of the palace of the city of the Pterians, the\r      present Euyuk, are probably later than the reign of Tiglath-\r      pileser, and may be attributed to the Xth or IXth century\r      before our era; they, however, probably give a very fair\r      idea of what the towns of the Cappadocian region were like\r      at the time of the first Assyrian invasions.\r \r [Illustration: 216.jpg GENERAL VIEW OF THE RUINS OF EUYUK]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph.\r \r [Illustration: 217.jpg THE SPHINX ON THE RIGHT OF EUYUK]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.\r \r Two colossal sphinxes guard the gateway of the principal edifice,\r and their presence proves with certainty how predominant was Egyptian\r influence even at this considerable distance from the banks of the Nile.\r They are not the ordinary sphinxes, with a human head surmounting the\r body of a lion couchant on its stone pedestal; but, like the Assyrian\r bulls, they are standing, and, to judge from the Hathorian locks which\r fall on each side of their countenances, they must have been intended\r to represent a protecting goddess rather than a male deity. A remarkable\r emblem is carved on the side of the upright to which their bodies are\r attached; it is none other than the double-headed eagle, the prototype\r of which is not infrequently found at Telloh in Lower Chaldæa, among\r remains dating from the time of the kings and vicegerents of Lagash.\r \r [Illustration: 218.jpg TWO BLOCKS COVERED WITH BAS-RELIEFS IN THE EUYUK\r PALACE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.\r \r The court or hall to which this gate gave access was decorated with\r bas-reliefs, which exhibit a glaring imitation of Babylonian art; we can\r still see on these the king, vested in his long flowing robes, praying\r before an altar, while further on is a procession of dignitaries\r following a troop of rams led by a priest to be sacrificed; another\r scene represents two individuals in the attitude of worship, wearing\r short loin-cloths, and climbing a ladder whose upper end has an\r uncertain termination, while a third person applies his hands to his\r mouth in the performance of some mysterious ceremony; beyond these are\r priests and priestesses moving in solemn file as if in the measured\r tread of some sacred dance, while in one corner we find the figure of a\r woman, probably a goddess, seated, holding in one hand a flower, perhaps\r the full-blown lotus, and in the other a cup from which she is about to\r drink. The costume of all these figures is that which Chaldæan fashion\r had imposed upon the whole of Western Asia, and consisted of the long\r heavy robe, falling from the shoulders to the feet, drawn in at the\r waist by a girdle; but it is to be noted that both sexes are shod with\r the turned-up shoes of the Hittites, and that the women wear high peaked\r caps.\r \r [Illustration: 219.jpg MYSTIC SCENE AT EUYUK]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.\r \r The composition of the scenes is rude, the drawing incorrect, and the\r general technique reminds us rather of the low reliefs of the Memphite\r or Theban sculptors than of the high projection characteristic of the\r artists of the Lower Euphrates. These slabs of sculptured stone formed\r a facing at the base of the now crumbling brick walls, the upper\r surface of which was covered with rough plastering. Here and there a\r few inscriptions reveal the name, titles, and parentage of some once\r celebrated personage, and mention the god in whose honour he had\r achieved the work.\r \r [Illustration: 220.jpg AN ASIATIC GODDESS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.\r \r The characters in which these inscriptions are written are not, as a\r rule, incised in the stone, but are cut in relief upon its surface,\r and if some few of them may remind us of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, the\r majority are totally unlike them, both in form and execution. A careful\r examination of them reveals a medley of human and animal outlines,\r geometrical figures, and objects of daily use, which all doubtless\r corresponded to some letter or syllable, but to which we have as yet\r no trustworthy key. This system of writing is one of a whole group of\r Asiatic scripts, specimens of which are common in this part of the world\r from Crete to the banks of the Euphrates and Orontes. It is thought that\r the Khâti must have already adopted it before their advent to power, and\r that it was they who propagated it in Northern Syria. It did not take\r the place of the cuneiform syllabary for ordinary purposes of daily life\r owing to its clumsiness and complex character, but its use was reserved\r for monumental inscriptions of a royal or religious kind, where it could\r be suitably employed as a framework to scenes or single figures.\r \r [Illustration: 221.jpg THE ASIATIC INSCRIPTION OF KOLITOLU-YAÎLA]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Hogarth.\r \r It, however, never presented the same graceful appearance and\r arrangement as was exhibited in the Egyptian hieroglyphs, the signs\r placed side by side being out of proportion with each other so as to\r destroy the general harmony of the lines, and it must be regarded as a\r script still in process of formation and not yet emerged from infancy.\r Every square yard of soil turned up among the ruins of the houses of\r Euyuk yields vestiges of tools, coarse pottery, terra-cotta and bronze\r statuettes of men and animals, and other objects of a not very high\r civilization. The few articles of luxury discovered, whether in\r furniture or utensils, were not indigenous products, but were imported\r for the most part from Chaldæa, Syria, Phoenicia, and perhaps from\r Egypt; some objects, indeed, came from the coast-towns of the Ægean,\r thus showing that Western influence was already in contact with the\r traditions of the East.\r \r [Illustration: 222.jpg DOUBLE SCEND OF OFFERINGS]\r \r      Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Hogarth. It\r      will be remarked that both altars are in the form of a\r      female without a head, but draped in the Assyrian robe.\r \r All the various races settled between the Halys and the Orontes were\r more or less imbued with this foreign civilization, and their monuments,\r though not nearly so numerous as those of the Pharaohs and Ninevite\r kings, bear, nevertheless, an equally striking evidence of its power.\r Examples of it have been pointed out in a score of different places in\r the valleys of the Taurus and on the plains of Cappadocia, in\r bas-reliefs, steke, seals, and intaglios, several of which must be\r nearly contemporaneous with the first Assyrian conquest.\r \r [Illustration: 223.jpg THE BAS-RELIEF OF IBRIZ]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Hogarth.\r \r One instance of it appears on the rocks at Ibriz, where a king stands in\r a devout attitude before a jovial giant whose hands are full of grapes\r and wheat-ears, while in another bas-relief near Frakhtîn we have a\r double scene of sacrifice. The rock-carving at Ibriz is, perhaps, of all\r the relics of a forgotten world, that which impresses the spectator most\r favourably. The concept of the scene is peculiarly naïve; indeed, the\r two figures are clumsily brought together, though each of them, when\r examined separately, is remarkable for its style and execution. The king\r has a dignified bearing in spite of his large head, round eyes, and the\r unskilful way in which his arms are set on his body. The figure of the\r god is not standing firmly on both feet, but the sculptor has managed\r to invest him with an air of grandeur and an expression of vigour and\r _bonhomie,_ which reminds us of certain types of the Greek Hercules.\r \r Tiglath-pileser was probably attracted to Asia Minor as much by\r considerations of mercantile interest as by the love of conquest or\r desire for spoil. It would, indeed, have been an incomparable gain for\r him had he been able, if not to seize the mines themselves, at least\r to come into such close proximity to them that he would be able to\r monopolise their entire output, and at the same time to lay hands on the\r great commercial highway to the trade centres of the west. The eastern\r terminus of this route lay already within his domains, namely, that\r which led to Assur by way of Amid, Nisibe, Singar, and the valley of the\r Upper Tigris; he was now desirous of acquiring that portion of it\r which wound its way from the fords of the Euphrates at Malatîyeh to the\r crossing of the Halys. The changes which had just taken place in\r Kummukh and Nairi had fully aroused the numerous petty sovereigns of\r the neighbourhood. The bonds which kept them together had not been\r completely severed at the downfall of the Hittite empire, and a certain\r sense of unity still lingered among them in spite of their continual\r feuds; they constituted, in fact, a sort of loose confederation, whose\r members never failed to help one another when they were threatened by a\r common enemy. As soon as the news of an Assyrian invasion reached them,\r they at once put aside their-mutual quarrels and combined to oppose\r the invader with their united forces. Tiglath-pileser had, therefore,\r scarcely crossed the Euphrates before he was attacked on his right flank\r by twenty-three petty kings of Naîri,* while sixty other chiefs from the\r same neighbourhood bore down upon him in front. He overcame the first\r detachment of the confederates, though not without a sharp struggle; he\r carried carnage into their ranks, as it were the whirlwind of Eammân,\r  and seized a hundred and twenty of the enemys chariots. The sixty\r chiefs, whose domains extended as far as the Upper Sea, ** were\r disconcerted by the news of the disaster, and of their own accord laid\r down their arms, or offered but a feeble resistance.\r \r      * The text of the Annals of the Xth year give thirty instead\r      of twenty-three; in the course of five or six years the\r      numbers have already become exaggerated.\r \r      ** The site of the Upper Sea has furnished material for\r      much discussion. Some believe it to be the Caspian Sea or\r      the Black Sea, others take it to be Lake Van, while some\r      think it to be the Mediterranean, and more particularly the\r      Gulf of Issus between Syria and Cilicia. At the present day\r      several scholars have returned to the theory which makes it\r      the Black Sea.\r \r Tiglath-pileser presented some of them in chains to the god Shamash; he\r extorted an oath of vassalage from them, forced them to give up their\r children as hostages, and laid a tax upon them _en masse_ of 1200\r stallions and 2000 bulls, after which he permitted them to return to\r their respective towns. He had, however, singled out from among them to\r grace his own triumph, Sini of Dayana, the only chief among them who had\r offered him an obstinate resistance; but even he was granted his liberty\r after he had been carried captive to Assur, and made to kneel before the\r gods of Assyria.*\r \r      * Dayani, which is mentioned in the Annals of Shalmaneser\r      II., has been placed on the banks of the Murad-su by\r      Schrader, and more particularly in the neighbourhood of\r      Melasgerd by Sayce; Delattre has shown that it was the last\r      and most westerly of twenty-three kingdoms conquered by\r      Tiglath-pileser I., and that it was consequently enclosed\r      between the Murad-su and the Euphrates proper.\r \r Before returning to the capital, Tiglath-pileser attacked Khanigalbat,\r and appeared before Milidia: as the town attempted no defence, he spared\r it, and contented himself with levying a small contribution upon\r its inhabitants. This expedition was rather of the nature of a\r reconnaissance than a conquest, but it helped to convince the king\r of the difficulty of establishing any permanent suzerainty over the\r country. The Asiatic peoples were quick to bow before a sudden attack;\r but no sooner had the conqueror departed, than those who had sworn him\r eternal fealty sought only how best to break their oaths. The tribes in\r immediate proximity to those provinces which had been long subject to\r the Assyrian rule, were intimidated into showing some respect for a\r power which existed so close to their own borders. But those further\r removed from the seat of government felt a certain security in\r their distance from it, and were tempted to revert to the state of\r independence they had enjoyed before the conquest; so that unless the\r sovereign, by a fresh campaign, promptly made them realise that their\r disaffection would not remain unpunished, they soon forgot their\r feudatory condition and the duties which it entailed.\r \r Three years of merciless conflict with obstinate and warlike mountain\r tribes had severely tried the Assyrian army, if it had not worn out\r the sovereign; the survivors of so many battles were in sore need of a\r well-merited repose, the gaps left by death had to be filled, and both\r infantry and chariotry needed the re-modelling of their corps. The\r fourth year of the kings reign, therefore, was employed almost entirely\r in this work of reorganisation; we find only the record of a raid of\r a few weeks against the Akhlamî and other nomadic Aramæans situated\r beyond the Mesopotamian steppes. The Assyrians spread over the district\r between the frontiers of Sukhi and the fords of Carchemish for a whole\r day, killing all who resisted, sacking the villages and laying hands\r on slaves and cattle. The fugitives escaped over the Euphrates, vainly\r hoping that they would be secure in the very heart of the Khâti.\r Tiglath-pileser, however, crossed the river on rafts supported on skins,\r and gave the provinces of Mount Bishri over to fire and sword:* six\r walled towns opened their gates to him without having ventured to strike\r a blow, and he quitted the country laden with spoil before the kings of\r the surrounding cities had had time to recover from their alarm.\r \r      * The country of Bishri was situated, as the _Annals_ point\r      out, in the immediate neighbourhood of Carchemish. The name\r      is preserved in that of Tell Basher still borne by the\r      ruins, and a modern village on the banks of the Sajur. The\r      Gebel Bishri to which Hommel alludes is too far to the south\r      to correspond to the description given in the inscription of\r      Tiglath-pileser.\r \r This expedition was for Tiglath-pileser merely an interlude between\r two more serious campaigns; and with the beginning of his fifth year\r he reappeared in the provinces of the Upper Euphrates to complete his\r conquest of them. He began by attacking and devastating Musri, which lay\r close to the territory of Milid. While thus occupied he was harassed by\r bands of Kumani; he turned upon them, overcame them, and imprisoned the\r remainder of them in the fortress of Arini, at the foot of Mount Aisa,\r where he forced them to kiss his feet. His victory over them, however,\r did not disconcert their neighbours. The bulk of the Kumani, whose\r troops had scarcely suffered in the engagement, fortified themselves\r on Mount Tala, to the number of twenty thousand; the king carried the\r heights by assault, and hotly pursued the fugitives as far as the range\r of Kharusa before Musri, where the fortress of Khunusa afforded them\r a retreat behind its triple walls of brick. The king, nothing daunted,\r broke his way through them one after another, demolished the ramparts,\r razed the houses, and strewed the ruins with salt; he then constructed\r a chapel of brick as a sort of trophy, and dedicated within it what\r was known as a copper thunderbolt, being an image of the missile which\r Eammân, the god of thunder, brandished in the face of his enemies. An\r inscription engraved on the object recorded the destruction of Khunusa,\r and threatened with every divine malediction the individual, whether\r an Assyrian or a stranger, who should dare to rebuild the city. This\r victory terrified the Kumani, and their capital, Kibshuna, opened\r its gates to the royal troops at the first summons. Tiglath-pileser\r completely destroyed the town, but granted the inhabitants their lives\r on condition of their paying tribute; he chose from among them, however,\r three hundred families who had shown him the most inveterate hostility,\r and sent them as exiles into Assyria.*\r \r      * The country of the Kumani or Kammanu is really the\r      district of Comana in Cataonia, and not the Comana Pontica\r      or the Khammanene on the banks of the Halys. Delattre thinks\r      that Tiglath-pileser penetrated into this region by the\r      Jihun, and consequently seeks to identify the names of towns\r      and mountains, e.g. Mount Ilamuni with Jaur-dagh, the\r      Kharusa with Shorsh-dagh, and the Tala with the Kermes-dagh;\r      but it is difficult to believe that, if the king took this\r      route, he would not mention the town of Marqasi-Marash,\r      which lay at the very foot of the Jaur-dagh, and would have\r      stopped his passage. It is more probable that the Assyrians,\r      starting from Melitene, which they had just subdued, would\r      have followed the route which skirts the northern slope of\r      the Taurus by Albistan; the scene of the conflict in this\r      case would probably have been the mountainous district of\r      Zeitûn.\r \r With this victory the first half of his reign drew to its close; in five\r years Tiglath-pileser had subjugated forty-two peoples and their princes\r within an area extending from the banks of the Lower Zab to the plains\r of the Khâti, and as far as the shores of the Western Seas. He revisited\r more than once these western and northern regions in which he had\r gained his early triumphs. The reconnaissance which he had made\r around Carchemish had revealed to him the great wealth of the Syrian\r table-land, and that a second raid in that direction could be made more\r profitable than ten successful campaigns in Naîri or upon the banks\r of the Zab. He therefore marched his battalions thither, this time\r to remain for more than a few days. He made his way through the whole\r breadth of the country, pushed forward up the valley of the Orontes,\r crossed the Lebanon, and emerged above the coast of the Mediterranean in\r the vicinity of Arvad.\r \r [Illustration: 230.jpg SACRIFICE OFFERED BEFORE THE ROYAL STELE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the\r      bronze gates of Balawât.\r \r This is the first time for many centuries that an Oriental sovereign had\r penetrated so far west; and his contemporaries must have been obliged\r to look back to the almost fabulous ages of Sargon of Agadê or of\r Khammurabi, to find in the long lists of the dynasties of the Euphrates\r any record of a sovereign who had planted his standards on the shores of\r the Sea of the Setting Sun.*\r \r      *This is the name given by the Assyrians to the\r      Mediterranean.\r \r Tiglath-pileser embarked on its waters, made a cruise into the open, and\r killed a porpoise, but we have no record of any battles fought, nor do\r we know how he was received by the Phoenician towns. He pushed on, it is\r thought, as far as the Nahr el-Kelb, and the sight of the hieroglyphic\r inscriptions which Ramses had caused to be cut there three centuries\r previously aroused his emulation. Assyrian conquerors rarely quitted\r the scene of their exploits without leaving behind them some permanent\r memorial of their presence. A sculptor having hastily smoothed the\r surface of a rock, cut out on it a figure of the king, to which was\r usually added a commemorative inscription. In front of this stele was\r erected an altar, upon which sacrifices were made, and if the monument\r was placed near a stream or the seashore, the soldiers were accustomed\r to cast portions of the victims into the water in order to propitiate\r the river-deities.\r \r [Illustration: 231.jpg PORTIONS OF THE SACRIFICIAL VICTIMS THROWN INTO\r THE WATER]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the\r      bronze gates of Balawât.\r \r One of the half-effaced Assyrian stelæ adjoining those of the Egyptian\r conqueror is attributed to Tiglath-pileser.*\r \r      *Boscawen thinks that we may attribute to Tiglath-pileser I.\r      the oldest of the Assyrian stelæ at Nahr el-Kelb; no\r      positive information has as yet confirmed this hypothesis,\r      which is in other respects very probable.\r \r It was on his return, perhaps, from this campaign that he planted\r colonies at Pitru on the right, and at Mutkînu on the left bank of the\r Euphrates, in order to maintain a watch over Carchemish, and the more\r important fords connecting Mesopotamia with the plains of the Apriê and\r the Orontes.*\r \r      * The existence of these colonies is known only from an\r      inscription of Shalmaneser II.\r \r The news of Tiglath-pilesers expedition was not long in reaching the\r Delta, and the Egyptian monarch then reigning at Tanis was thus made\r acquainted with the fact that there had arisen in Syria a new power\r before which his own was not unlikely to give way. In former times such\r news would have led to a war between the two states, but the time\r had gone by when Egypt was prompt to take up arms at the slightest\r encroachment on her Asiatic provinces. Her influence at this time was\r owing merely to her former renown, and her authority beyond the isthmus\r was purely traditional. The Tanite Pharaoh had come to accept with\r resignation the change in the fortunes of Egypt, and he therefore\r contented himself with forwarding to the Assyrian conqueror, by one of\r the Syrian coasting vessels, a present of some rare wild beasts and\r a few crocodiles. In olden times Assyria had welcomed the arrival of\r Thûtmosis III. on the Euphrates by making him presents, which the Theban\r monarch regarded in the light of tribute: the case was now reversed, the\r Egyptian Pharaoh taking the position formerly occupied by the Assyrian\r monarch. Tiglath-pileser graciously accepted this unexpected homage, but\r the turbulent condition of the northern tribes prevented his improving\r the occasion by an advance into Phoenicia and the land of Canaan. Naîri\r occupied his attention on two separate occasions at least; on the second\r of these he encamped in the neighbourhood of the source of the river\r Subnat. This stream, had for a long period issued from a deep grotto,\r where in ancient times a god was supposed to dwell. The conqueror\r was lavish in religious offerings here, and caused a bas-relief to be\r engraved on the entrance in remembrance of his victories.\r \r [Illustration 233.jpg THE STELE AT SEBENNEH-SU]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by P. Taylor, in G.\r      Rawlinson.\r \r He is here represented as standing upright, the tiara on his brow, and\r his right arm extended as if in the act of worship, while his left, the\r elbow brought up to his side, holds a club. The inscription appended\r to the figure tells, with an eloquence all the more effective from its\r brevity, how, with the aid of Assur, Shamash, and Eammân, the\r great gods, my lords, I, Tiglath-pileser, King of Assyria, son of\r Assurîshishî, King of Assyria, son of Mutakkilnusku, King of Assyria,\r conqueror from the great sea, the Mediterranean, to the great sea of\r Naîri, I went for the third time to Naîri.\r \r The gods who had so signally favoured the monarch received the greater\r part of the spoils which he had secured in his campaigns. The majority\r of the temples of Assyria, which were founded at a time when its city\r was nothing more than a provincial capital owing allegiance to Babylon,\r were either, it would appear, falling to ruins from age, or presented a\r sorry exterior, utterly out of keeping with the magnitude of its recent\r wealth. The king set to work to enlarge or restore the temples of\r Ishtar, Martu, and the ancient Bel;* he then proceeded to rebuild,\r from the foundations to the summit, that of Anu and Bammân, which the\r vicegerent Samsirammân, son of Ismidagan, had constructed seven hundred\r and one years previously. This temple was the principal sanctuary of\r the city, because it was the residence of the chief of the gods, Assur,\r under his appellation of Anu.**\r \r      * Bel the ancient, or possibly the ancient master,\r       appears to have been one of the names of Anu, who is\r      naturally in this connexion the same as Assur.\r \r      ** This was the great temple of which the ruins still exist.\r \r The soil was cleared away down to the bed-rock, upon which an enormous\r substructure, consisting of fifty courses of bricks, was laid, and above\r this were erected two lofty ziggurâts, whose tile-covered surfaces shone\r like the rising sun in their brightness; the completion of the whole was\r commemorated by a magnificent festival. The special chapel of Bammân\r and his treasury, dating from the time of the same Samsirammân who had\r raised the temple of Anu, were also rebuilt on a more important scale.*\r \r      * The British Museum possesses bricks bearing the name of\r      Tiglath-pileser I., brought from this temple, as is shown by\r      the inscription on their sides.\r \r These works were actively carried on notwithstanding the fact that war\r was raging on the frontier; however preoccupied he might be with warlike\r projects, Tiglath-pileser never neglected the temples, and set to work\r to collect from every side materials for their completion and adornment.\r \r [Illustration: 235.jpg TRANSPORT OF BUILDING MATERIALS BY WATER]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief on the bronze\r      doors at Balawât.\r \r He brought, for example, from Naîri such marble and hard stone as might\r be needed for sculptural purposes, together with the beams of cedar and\r cypress required by his carpenters. The mountains of Singar and of the\r Zab furnished the royal architects with building stone for ordinary\r uses, and for those facing slabs of bluish gypsum on which the\r bas-reliefs of the kings exploits were carved; the blocks ready squared\r were brought down the affluents of the Tigris on rafts or in boats, and\r thus arrived at their destination without land transport.\r \r [Illustration: 236.jpg RARE ANIMALS BROUGHT BACK AS TROPHIES BY THE\r KING]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the cast in the Louvre. The\r      original is in the British Museum.\r \r The kings of Assyria, like the Pharaohs, had always had a passion for\r rare trees and strange animals; as soon as they entered a country, they\r inquired what natural curiosities it contained, and they would send back\r to their own land whatever specimens of them could be procured.\r \r [Illustration: 237.jpg MONKEY BROUGHT BACK AS TRIBUTE]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the bas-relief in Layard.\r \r The triumphal _cortege_ which accompanied the monarch on his return\r after each campaign comprised not only prisoners and spoil of a\r useful sort, but curiosities from all the conquered districts, as,\r for instance, animals of unusual form or habits, rhinoceroses and\r crocodiles,* and if some monkey of a rare species had been taken in the\r sack of a town, it also would find a place in the procession, either\r held in a leash or perched on the shoulders of its keeper.\r \r      * A crocodile sent as a present by the King of Egypt is\r      mentioned in the _Inscription of the Broken Obelisk_. The\r      animal is called _namsukha_, which is the Egyptian _msuhu_\r      with the plural article _na._\r \r The campaigns of the monarch were thus almost always of a double nature,\r comprising not merely a conflict with men, but a continual pursuit of\r wild beasts. Tiglath-pileser, in the service of Ninib, had killed four\r great specimens of the male urus in the desert of Mitanni, near to the\r town of Arazîki, opposite to the countries of the Khâti;* he killed them\r with his powerful bow, his dagger of iron, his pointed lance, and he\r brought back their skins and horns to his city of Assur. He secured ten\r strong male elephants, in the territory of Harrân and upon the banks of\r the Khabur, and he took four of them alive: he brought back their skins\r and their tusks, together with the living elephants, to his city of\r Assur. He killed moreover, doubtless also in the service of Ninib, a\r hundred and twenty lions, which he attacked on foot, despatching eight\r hundred more with arrows from his chariot,** all within the short space\r of five years, and we may well ask what must have been the sum total,\r if the complete record for his whole reign were extant. We possess,\r unfortunately, no annals of the later years of this monarch; we have\r reason to believe that he undertook several fresh expeditions into\r Nairi,*** and a mutilated tablet records some details of troubles with\r Elam in the Xth year of his reign.\r \r      * The town of Arazîki has been identified with the Eragiza\r      (Eraziga) of Ptolemy; the Eraziga of Ptolemy was on the\r      right bank of the Euphrates, while the text of Tiglath-\r      pileser appears to place Arazîki on the left bank.\r \r      ** The account of the hunts in the _Annals_ is supplemented\r      by the information furnished in the first column of the\r      Broken Obelisk. The monument is of the time of Assur-nazir-\r      pal, but the first column contains an abstract from an\r      account of an anonymous hunt, which a comparison of numbers\r      and names leads us to attribute to Tiglath-pileser I.; some\r      Assyri-ologists, however, attribute it to Assur-nazir-pal.\r \r      * The inscription of Sebbeneh-Su was erected at the time of\r      the third expedition into Naîri, and the _Annals_ give only\r      one; the other two expeditions must, therefore, be\r      subsequent to the Vth year of his reign.\r \r We gather that he attacked a whole series of strongholds, some of\r whose names have a Cossæan ring about them, such as Madkiu, Sudrun,\r Ubrukhundu, Sakama, Shuria, Khirishtu, and Andaria. His advance in this\r direction must have considerably provoked the Chaldæans, and, indeed,\r it was not long before actual hostilities broke out between the two\r nations. The first engagement took place in the valley of the Lower Zab,\r in the province of Arzukhina, without any decisive result, but in the\r following year fortune favoured the Assyrians, for Dur-kurigalzu, both\r Sipparas, Babylon, and Upi opened their gates to them, while Akar-sallu,\r the Akhlamê, and the whole of Sukhi as far as Eapîki tendered their\r submission to Tiglath-achuch-sawh-akhl-pileser.\r \r [Illustration: 239.jpg MERODACH-NADIN-AKHI]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the heliogravure in Pr.\r      Lenormant. The original is in the British Museum. It is one\r      of the boundary stones which were set up in a corner of a\r      field to mark its legal limit.\r \r Merodach-nadin-akhi, who was at this time reigning in Chaldæa, was\r like his ancestor Nebuchadrezzar I., a brave and warlike sovereign: he\r appears at first to have given way under the blow thus dealt him, and to\r have acknowledged the suzerainty of his rival, who thereupon assumed the\r title of Lord of the four Houses of the World, and united under a single\r empire the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates. But this state of things\r lasted for a few years only; Merodach-nadin-akhi once more took courage,\r and, supported by the Chaldæan nobility, succeeded in expelling the\r intruders from Sumir and Akkad. The Assyrians, however, did not allow\r themselves to be driven out without a struggle, but fortune turned\r against them; they were beaten, and the conqueror inflicted on the\r Assyrian gods the humiliation to which they had so often subjected those\r of other nations. He took the statues of Eammân and Shala from Ekallati,\r carried them to Babylon, and triumphantly set them up within the temple\r of Bel. There they remained in captivity for 418 years.* Tiglath-pileser\r did not long survive this disaster, for he died about the year 1100\r B.C.,** and two of his sons succeeded him on the throne. The elder,\r Assur-belkala,*** had neither sufficient energy nor resources to resume\r the offensive, and remained a passive spectator of the revolutions which\r distracted Babylon.\r \r      * We know this fact from the inscription of Bavian, in which\r      Sennacherib boasts of having brought back these statues to\r      Assyria after they had been 418 years in the possession of\r      the enemy. I have followed the commonly received opinion,\r      which places the defeat of Tiglath-pileser after the taking\r      of Babylon; others think that it preceded the decisive\r      victory of the Assyrians. It is improbable that, if the loss\r      of the statues preceded the decisive victory, the Assyrian\r      conquerors should have left their gods prisoners in a\r      Babylonian temple, and should not have brought them back\r      immediately to Ekallati.\r \r      ** The death of Tiglath-pileser must have followed quickly\r      on the victory of Babylon; the contents of the inscription\r      of Bavian permit us to fix the taking of Ekallati by the\r      Chaldæans about the year 1108-1106 B.C. We shall not be far\r      wrong in supposing Tiglath-pileser to have reigned six or\r      eight years after his defeat.\r \r      *** I followed the usually received classification. It is,\r      however, possible that we must reverse the order of the\r      sovereigns.\r \r Merodach-nadin-akhi had been followed by his son Merodach-shapîk-zîrîm,*\r but this prince was soon dethroned by the people, and Bammân-abaliddîn,\r a man of base extraction, seized the crown.\r \r      * The name of the Babylonian king has been variously read\r      Merodach-shapîk-zirat, Merodach-shapîk-kullat, Merodach-\r      shapîk-zirmâti and Merodach-shapîk-zîrîm.\r \r Assur-belkala not only extended to this usurper the friendly relations\r he had kept up with the legitimate sovereign, but he asked for the hand\r of his daughter in marriage, and the rich dowry which she brought her\r husband no doubt contributed to the continuation of his pacific policy.\r He appears also to have kept possession of all the parts of Mesopotamia\r and Kammukh conquered by his father, and it is possible that he may have\r penetrated beyond the Euphrates. His brother, Samsi-rammân III.,\r does not appear to have left any more definite mark upon history than\r Assur-belkala; he decorated the temples built by his predecessors,\r but beyond this we have no certain record of his achievements. We know\r nothing of the kings who followed him, their names even having been\r lost, but about a century and a half after Tiglath-pileser, a certain\r Assurirba seems to have crossed Northern Syria, and following in the\r footsteps of his great ancestor, to have penetrated as far as the\r Mediterranean: on the rocks of Mount Amanus, facing the sea, he left\r a triumphal inscription in which he set forth the mighty deeds he\r had accomplished. This is merely a gleam out of the murky night which\r envelops his history, and the testimony of one of his descendants\r informs us that his good fortune soon forsook him: the Aramaeans wrested\r from him the fortresses of Pitru and Mutkînu, which commanded both banks\r of the Euphrates near Carchemish. Nor did the retrograde movement slaken\r after his time: Assyria slowly wasted away down to the end of the Xth\r century, and but for the simultaneous decadence of the Chaldaeans, its\r downfall would have been complete. But neither Rammân-abaliddîn nor his\r successor was able to take advantage of its weakness; discord and\r want of energy soon brought about their own ruin. The dynasty of\r Pashê disappeared towards the middle of the Xth century, and a family\r belonging to the Countries of the Sea took its place: it had continued\r for about one hundred and thirty-two years, and had produced eleven\r kings.*\r \r      * It is no easy matter to draw up an exact list of this\r      dynasty, and Hilprechts attempt to do so contains more than\r      one doubtful name. The following list is very imperfect and\r      doubtful, but the best that our present knowledge enables us\r      to put forward.\r \r [Illustration: 242.jpg TABLE OF KINGS]\r \r What were the causes of this depression, from which Babylon suffered at\r almost regular intervals, as though stricken with some periodic malady?\r The main reason soon becomes apparent if we consider the nature of\r the country and the material conditions of its existence. Chaldæa was\r neither extensive enough nor sufficiently populous to afford a solid\r basis for the ambition of her princes. Since nearly every man capable\r of bearing arms was enrolled in the army, the Chaktean kings had no\r difficulty in raising, at a moments notice, a force which could be\r employed to repel an invasion, or make a sudden attack on some distant\r territory; it was in schemes which required prolonged and sustained\r effort that they felt the drawbacks of their position. In that age of\r hand-to-hand combats, the mortality in battle was very high, forced\r marches through forests and across mountains entailed a heavy loss of\r men, and three or four consecutive campaigns against a stubborn foe soon\r reduced an army to a condition of dangerous weakness. Recruits might be\r obtained to fill the earlier vacancies in the ranks, but they soon grew\r fewer and fewer if time was not given for recovery after the opening\r victories in the struggle, and the supply eventually ceased if\r operations were carried on beyond a certain period.\r \r The total duration of the dynasty was, according to the Royal Canon, 72\r years 6 months. Peiser has shown that this is a mistake, and he proposes\r to correct it to 132 years 6 months, and this is accepted by most\r Assyri-ologists.\r \r A reign which began brilliantly often came to an impotent conclusion,\r owing to the king having failed to economise his reserves; and the\r generations which followed, compelled to adopt a strictly defensive\r attitude, vegetated in a sort of anaemic condition, until the birth-rate\r had brought the proportion of males up to a figure sufficiently high to\r provide the material for a fresh army. When Nebuchadrezzar made war upon\r Assurîshishî, he was still weak from the losses he had incurred during\r the campaign against Elam, and could not conduct his attack with the\r same vigour as had gained him victory on the banks of the Ulaî; in\r the first year he only secured a few indecisive advantages, and in the\r second he succumbed. Merodach-nadin-akhi was suffering from the reverses\r sustained by his predecessors when Tiglath-pileser provoked him to war,\r and though he succeeded in giving a good account of an adversary who was\r himself exhausted by dearly bought successes, he left to his descendants\r a kingdom which had been drained of its last drop of blood. The same\r reason which explains the decadence of Babylon shows us the cause of\r the periodic eclipses undergone by Assyria after each outburst of her\r warlike spirit. She, too, had to pay the penalty of an ambition\r which was out of all proportion to her resources. The mighty deeds of\r Shalmaneser and Tukulti-ninip were, as a natural consequence,\r followed by a state of complete prostration under Tukultiassurbel\r and Assurnîrarî: the country was now forced to pay for the glories of\r Assurîshishî and of Tiglath-pileser by falling into an inglorious state\r of languor and depression. Its kings, conscious that their rule must be\r necessarily precarious as long as they did not possess a larger stock of\r recruits to fall back on, set their wits to work to provide by various\r methods a more adequate reserve. While on one hand they installed native\r Assyrians in the more suitable towns of conquered countries, on the\r other they imported whole hordes of alien prisoners chosen for their\r strength and courage, and settled them down in districts by the banks of\r the Tigris and the Zab. We do not know what Eammânirâni and Shalmaneser\r may have done in this way, but Tiglath-pileser undoubtedly introduced\r thousands of the Mushku, the Urumseans, the people of Kummukh and\r Naîri, and his example was followed by all those of his successors\r whose history has come down to us. One might have expected that such an\r invasion of foreigners, still smarting under the sense of defeat, might\r have brought with it an element of discontent or rebellion; far from\r it, they accepted their exile as a judgment of the gods, which the\r gods alone had a right to reverse, and did their best to mitigate the\r hardness of their lot by rendering unhesitating obedience to their\r masters. Their grandchildren, born in the midst of Assyrians, became\r Assyrians themselves, and if they did not entirely divest themselves of\r every trace of their origin, at any rate became so closely identified\r with the country of their adoption, that it was difficult to distinguish\r them from the native race. The Assyrians who were sent out to colonise\r recently acquired provinces were at times exposed to serious risks. Now\r and then, instead of absorbing the natives among whom they lived, they\r were absorbed by them, which meant a loss of so much fighting strength\r to the mother country; even under the most favourable conditions\r a considerable time must have passed before they could succeed in\r assimilating to themselves the races amongst whom they lived. At\r last, however, a day would dawn when the process of incorporation was\r accomplished, and Assyria, having increased her area and resources\r twofold, found herself ready to endure to the end the strain of\r conquest. In the interval, she suffered from a scarcity of fighting men,\r due to the losses incurred in her victories, and must have congratulated\r herself that her traditional foe was not in a position to take advantage\r of this fact.\r \r The first wave of the Assyrian invasion had barely touched Syria; it\r had swept hurriedly over the regions in the north, and then flowed\r southwards to return no more, so that the northern races were able to\r resume the wonted tenor of their lives. For centuries after this\r their condition underwent no change; there was the same repetition of\r dissension and intrigue, the same endless succession of alliances and\r battles without any signal advantage on either side. The Hittites still\r held Northern Syria: Carchemish was their capital, and more than one\r town in its vicinity preserved the tradition of their dress, their\r language, their arts, and their culture in full vigour. The Greek\r legends tell us vaguely of some sort of Cilician empire which is said\r to have brought the eastern and central provinces of Asia Minor into\r subjection about ten centuries before our era.*\r \r      * Solinus, relying on the indirect evidence of Hecatseus of\r      Miletus, tells us that Cilicia extended not only to the\r      countries afterwards known as Cataonia, Commagene, and\r      Syria, but also included Lydia, Media, Armenia, Pamphylia,\r      and Cappadocia; the conquests of the Assyrian kings must\r      have greatly reduced its area. I am of opinion that the\r      tradition preserved by  Hecatous referred both to the\r      kingdom of Sapalulu and to that of the monarchs of this\r      second epoch.\r \r Is there any serious foundation for such a belief, and must we assume\r that there existed at this time and in this part of the world a kingdom\r similar to that of Sapalulu? Assyria was recruiting its forces, Chaldæa\r was kept inactive by its helplessness, Egypt slumbered by the banks of\r its river, there was no actor of the first rank to fill the stage; now\r was the opportunity for a second-rate performer to come on the scene and\r play such a part as his abilities permitted. The Cilician conquest, if\r this be indeed the date at which it took place, had the boards to itself\r for a hundred years after the defeat of Assurirba. The time was too\r short to admit of its striking deep root in the country. Its leaders and\r men were, moreover, closely related to the Syrian Hittites; the language\r they spoke was, if not precisely the Hittite, at any rate a dialect of\r it; their customs were similar, if, perhaps, somewhat less refined, as\r is often the case with mountain races, when compared with the peoples of\r the plain. We are tempted to conclude that some of the monuments found\r south of the Taurus were their handiwork, or, at any rate, date from\r their time. For instance, the ruined palace at Sinjirli, the lower\r portions of which are ornamented with pictures similar to those\r at Pteria, representing processions of animals, some real, others\r fantastic, men armed with lances or bending the bow, and processions\r of priests or officials. Then there is the great lion at Marash, which\r stands erect, with menacing head, its snarling lips exposing the teeth;\r its body is seamed with the long lines of an inscription in the Asiatic\r character, in imitation of those with which the bulls in the Assyrian\r palaces are covered. These Cilicians gave an impulse to the civilization\r of the Khâti which they sorely needed, for the Semitic races, whom they\r had kept in subjection for centuries, now pressed them hard on all the\r territory over which they had formerly reigned, and were striving to\r drive them back into the hills.\r \r [Illustration: 248.jpg LION AT MAKASH]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph of the cast shown at the\r      Paris Exhibition of 1889.\r \r The Aramæans in particular gave them a great deal of trouble. The states\r on the banks of the Euphrates had found them awkward neighbours; was\r this the moment chosen by the Pukudu, the Eutu, the Gambulu, and a dozen\r other Aramaean tribes, for a stealthy march across the frontier of Elam,\r between Durilu and the coast? The tribes from which, soon after, the\r Kaldi nation was formed, were marauding round Eridu, Uru, and Larsa, and\r may have already begun to lay the foundations of their supremacy over\r Babylon: it is, indeed, an open question whether those princes of the\r Countries of the Sea who succeeded the Pashê dynasty did not come from\r the stock of the Kaldi Aramaeans. While they were thus consolidating on\r the south-east, the bulk of the nation continued to ascend northwards,\r and rejoined its outposts in the central region of the Euphrates, which\r extends from the Tigris to the Khabur, from the Khabur to the Balîkh and\r the Apriê. They had already come into frequent conflict with most of the\r victorious Assyrian kings, from Eammânirâri down to Tiglath-pileser; the\r weakness of Assyria and Chaldæa gave them their opportunity, and they\r took full advantage of it. They soon became masters of the whole of\r Mesopotamia; a part of the table-land extending from Carchemish to Mount\r Amanus fell into their hands, their activity was still greater in the\r basin of the Orontes, and their advanced guard, coming into collision\r with the Amorites near the sources of the Litany, began gradually to\r drive farther and farther southwards all that remained of the races\r which had shown so bold a front to the Egyptian troops. Here was an\r almost entirely new element, gradually eliminating from the scene of the\r struggle other elements which had grown old through centuries of war,\r and while this transformation was taking place in Northern and Central,\r a similar revolution was effecting a no less surprising metamorphosis in\r Southern Syria. There, too, newer races had gradually come to displace\r the nations over which the dynasties of Thûtmosis and Ramses had once\r held sway. The Hebrews on the east, the Philistines and their allies on\r the south-west, were about to undertake the conquest of the Kharu and\r its cities. As yet their strength was inadequate, their temperament\r undecided, their system of government imperfect; but they brought with\r them the quality of youth, and energies which, rightly guided, would\r assure the nation which first found out how to take advantage of\r them, supremacy over all its rivals, and the strength necessary for\r consolidating the whole country into a single kingdom.\r \r [Illustration: 250.jpg TAILPIECE]\r \r \r \r \r CHAPTER III--THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES--DAMASCUS\r \r \r _THE ISRAELITES IN THE LAND OF CANAAN: THE JUDGES--THE PHILISTINES AND\r THE HEBREW KINGDOM--SAUL, DAVID, SOLOMON, THE DEFECTION OF THE TEN\r TRIBES--THE XXIst EGYPTIAN DYNASTY--SHESHONQ OR SHISHAK DAMASCUS._\r \r _The Hebrews in the desert: their families, clans, and tribes--The\r Amorites and the Hebrews on the left bank of the Jordan--The conquest\r of Canaan and the native reaction against the Hebrews--The judges, Ehud,\r Deborah, Jerubbaal or Gideon and the Manassite supremacy; Abimelech,\r Jephihdh._\r \r _The Philistines, their political organisation, their army and\r fleet--Judah, Dan, and the story of Samson--Benjamin on the Philistine\r frontier--Eli and the ark of the covenant--The Philistine dominion over\r Israel; Samuel, Saul, the Benjamite monarchy--David, his retreat to the\r desert of Judah and his sojourn at Zilclag--The battle of Gilboa and the\r death of Saul--The struggle between Ish-bosheth and David--David sole\r king, and the final defeat of the Philistines--Jerusalem becomes\r the capital; the removal of the ark--Wars with the peoples of the\r East--Absaloms rebellion; the coronation of Solomon._\r \r _Solomons government and his buildings--Phoenician colonisation in\r Spain: Hiram I. and the enlargement of Tyre--The voyages to Ophir and\r Tarshish--The palace at Jerusalem, the temple and its dedication: the\r priesthood and prophets--The death of Solomon; the schism of the ten\r tribes and the division of the Hebrew kingdom._\r \r _The XXIst Egyptian dynasty: the Theban high priests and the Tanite\r Pharaohs--The Libyan mercenaries and their predominance in the state:\r the origin of the XXIInd (Bubastite) dynasty--Sheshonq I. as king\r and his son Aûpûti as high priest of Amon; the hiding-place at Deîr\r el-Baharî--Sheshonqs expedition against Jerusalem._\r \r _The two Hebrew kingdoms; the fidelity of Judah to the descendants\r of Solomon, and the repeated changes of dynasty in Israel--Asa and\r Baasha--The kingdom of Damascus and its origin--Bezon, Tabrimmon,\r Benhadad I.--Omri and the foundation of Samaria: Ahab and the Tyrian\r alliance--The successors of Hiram I. at Tyre: Ithobaal I.--The prophets,\r their struggle against Phonician idolatry, the story of Elijah--The wars\r between Israel and Damascus up to the time of the Assyrian invasion._\r \r \r [Illustration: 253.jpg PAGE IMAGE]\r \r \r \r \r CHAPTER III--THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES--DAMASCUS\r \r \r _The Israelites in the land of Canaan: the judges--The Philistines\r and the Hebrew kingdom--Saul, David, Solomon, the defection of the ten\r tribes--the XXIst Egyptian dynasty--Sheshonq--Damascus._\r \r \r After reaching Kadesh-barnea, the Israelites in their wanderings had\r come into contact with various Bedawin tribes--Kenites, Jerahmelites,\r Edomites, and Midianites, with whom they had in turn fought or allied\r themselves, according to the exigencies of their pastoral life.\r Continual skirmishes had taught them the art of war, their numbers had\r rapidly increased, and with this increase came a consciousness of their\r own strength, so that, after a lapse of two or three generations, they\r may be said to have constituted a considerable nation. Its component\r elements were not, however, firmly welded together; they consisted of\r an indefinite number of clans, which were again subdivided into several\r families. Each of these families had its chief or ruler, to whom it\r rendered absolute obedience, while the united chiefs formed an assembly\r of elders who administered justice when required, and settled any\r differences which arose among their respective followers. The clans in\r their turn were grouped into tribes,* according to certain affinities\r which they mutually recognised, or which may have been fostered by daily\r intercourse on a common soil, but the ties which bound them together at\r this period were of the most slender character. It needed some special\r event, such as a projected migration in search of fresh pasturage, or\r an expedition against a turbulent neighbour, or a threatened invasion\r by some stranger, to rouse the whole tribe to corporate action; at\r such times they would elect a nasi, or ruler, the duration of whose\r functions ceased with the emergency which had called him into office.**\r \r      * The tribe was designated by two words signifying staff or\r      branch.\r \r      ** The word _nasi,_ first applied to the chiefs of the\r      tribes (_Exod._ xxxiv. 31; _Lev_. iv. 22; _Numb_. ii. 3),\r      became, after the captivity, the title of the chiefs of\r      Israel, who could not be called _kings_ owing to the foreign\r      suzerainty (_Esdras_ i. 8).\r \r Both clans and tribes were designated by the name of some ancestor from\r whom they claimed to be descended, and who appears in some cases to\r have been a god for whom they had a special devotion; some writers have\r believed that this was also the origin of the names given to several of\r the tribes, such as Gad, Good Fortune, or of the totems of the hyena\r and the dog, in Arabic and Hebrew, Simeon and Caleb. * Gad, Simeon,\r and Caleb were severally the ancestors of the families who ranged\r themselves under their respective names, and the eponymous heroes of\r all the tribes were held to have been brethren, sons of one father, and\r under the protection of one God. He was known as the Jahveh with whom\r Abraham of old had made a solemn covenant; His dwelling-place was Mount\r Sinai or Mount Seîr, and He revealed Himself in the storm;** His voice\r was as the thunder which shaketh the wilderness, His breath was as a\r consuming fire, and He was decked with light as with a garment. When\r His anger was aroused, He withheld the dew and rain from watering the\r earth; but when His wrath was appeased, the heavens again poured their\r fruitful showers upon the fields.***\r \r      * Simeon is derived by some from a word which at times\r      denotes a hyena, at others a cross between a dog and a\r      hyena, according to Arab lexicography. With regard to Caleb,\r      Renan prefers a different interpretation; it is supposed to\r      be a shortened form of Kalbel, and Dog of El is a strong\r      expression to denote the devotion of a tribe to its patron\r      god.\r \r      ** Cf. the graphic description of the signs which\r      accompanied the manifestations of Jahveh in the _Song of\r      Deborah (Judges_ v. 4, 5), and also in 1 _Kings_ xix. 11-13.\r \r      *** See 1 _Kings_ xvii., xviii., where the conflict between\r      Elijah and the prophets of Baal for the obtaining of rain is\r      described.\r \r He is described as being a jealous God, brooking no rival, and\r visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third\r and fourth generation. We hear of His having been adored under the\r figure of a calf, * and of His Spirit inspiring His prophets, as well\r as of the anointed stones which were dedicated in His honour. The common\r ancestor of the nation was acknowledged to have been Jacob, who, by his\r wrestling with God, had obtained the name of Israel; the people were\r divided theoretically into as many tribes as he had sons, but the number\r twelve to which they were limited does not entirely correspond with all\r that we know up to the present time of these children of Israel. Some\r of the tribes appear never to have had any political existence, as for\r example that of Levi,** or they were merged at an early date into some\r fellow-tribe, as in the case of Reuben with Gad;*** others, such as\r Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, and Judah, apparently did not attain their\r normal development until a much later date.\r \r      * The most common of these animal forms was that of a calf\r      or bull (Exod. xxxii.; Deut. ix. 21; and in the kingly\r      period, 1 Kings xii. 28-30; 2 Kings x. 29); we are not told\r      the form of the image of Micah the Ephraimite (Judges xviii.\r      14, 17, 18, 20, 30, 31).\r \r      ** Levi appears to have suffered dispersion after the events\r      of which there are two separate accounts combined in Gen.\r      xxxiv. In conjunction with Simeon, he appears to have\r      revenged the violation of his sister Dinah by a massacre of\r      the Shechemites, and the dispersion alluded to in Jacobs\r      blessing (Gen. xlix. 5-7) is mentioned as consequent on this\r      act of barbarism.\r \r      *** In the IXth century Mesha of Moab does not mention the\r      Reubenites, and speaks of the Gadites only as inhabiting the\r      territory formerly occupied by them. Tradition attributed\r      the misfortunes of the tribe to the crime of its chief in\r      his seduction of Bilhah, his fathers concubine (Gen. xlix.\r      3, 4; cf. xxxv. 22)\r \r The Jewish chroniclers attempted by various combinations to prove that\r the sacred number of tribes was the correct one. At times they included\r Levi in the list, in which case Joseph was reckoned as one;* while on\r other occasions Levi or Simeon was omitted, when for Joseph would be\r substituted his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh.** In addition to this,\r the tribes were very unequal in size: Ephraim, Gad, and Manasseh\r comprised many powerful and wealthy families; Dan, on the contrary,\r contained so few, that it was sometimes reckoned as a mere clan.\r \r      * As, for instance, in Jacobs blessing (Gen. xlix. 5-7) and\r      in the enumeration of the patriarchs sons at the time of\r      his journey to Egypt (Gen. xlvi. 9-26).\r \r      ** Numb. i. 20, et seq., where the descendants of Levi are\r      not included among the twelve, and Deut. xxxiii. 6-25, where\r      Simeon is omitted from among the tribes blessed by Moses\r      before his death.\r \r The tribal organisation had not reached its full development at the\r time of the sojourn in the desert. The tribes of Joseph and Judah, who\r subsequently played such important parts, were at that period not held\r in any particular estimation; Reuben, on the other hand, exercised a\r sort of right of priority over the rest.*\r \r      * This conclusion is drawn from the position of eldest son\r      given to him in all the genealogies enumerating the children\r      of Jacob. Stade, on the contrary, is inclined to believe\r      that this place of honour was granted to him on account of\r      the smallness of his family, to prevent any jealousy arising\r      between the more powerful tribes, such as Ephraim and Judah\r      (_Ges. des Vollces Isr._, vol. i. pp. 151, 152).\r \r The territory which they occupied soon became insufficient to support\r their numbers, and they sought to exchange it for a wider area, such as\r was offered by the neighbouring provinces of Southern Syria. Pharaoh\r at this time exercised no authority over this region, and they were,\r therefore, no longer in fear of opposition from his troops; the latter\r had been recalled to Egypt, and it is doubtful even whether he retained\r possession of the Shephelah by means of his Zakkala and Philistine\r colonies; the Hebrews, at any rate, had nothing to fear from him so long\r as they respected Gaza and Ascalon. They began by attempting to possess\r themselves of the provinces around Hebron, in the direction of the Dead\r Sea, and we read that, before entering them, they sent out spies to\r reconnoitre and report on the country.* Its population had undergone\r considerable modifications since the Israelites had quitted Goshen.\r The Amorites, who had seriously suffered from the incursions of Asiatic\r hordes, and had been constantly harassed by the attacks of the Aramæans,\r had abandoned the positions they had formerly occupied on the banks\r of the Orontes and the Litany, and had moved southwards, driving the\r Canaanites before them; their advance was accelerated as the resistance\r opposed to their hordes became lessened under the successors of Ramses\r III., until at length all opposition was withdrawn. They had possessed\r themselves of the regions about the Lake of Genesareth, the mountain\r district to the south of Tabor, the middle valley of the Jordan, and,\r pressing towards the territory east of that river, had attacked the\r cities scattered over the undulating table-land. This district had\r not been often subjected to incursions of Egyptian troops, and yet its\r inhabitants had been more impressed by Egyptian influence than many\r others.\r \r [Illustration: 259.jpg THE AMORITE ASTARTE]\r \r      Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from the squeezes and sketches\r      published in the _Zeitschrift ties Palcistina-Vereins_.\r \r Whereas, in the north and west, cuneiform writing was almost entirely\r used, attempts had been made here to adapt the hieroglyphs to the native\r language.\r \r The only one of their monuments which has been preserved is a rudely\r carved bas-relief in black basalt, representing a two-horned Astarte,\r before whom stands a king in adoration; the sovereign is Ramses II., and\r the inscriptions accompanying the figures contain a religious formula\r together with a name borrowed from one of the local dialects.*\r \r      *This is the Stone of Job discovered by Strahmacher. The\r      inscription appears to give the name of a goddess, Agana-\r      Zaphon, the second part of which recalls the name of Baal-\r      Zephon.\r \r The Amorites were everywhere victorious, but our information is confined\r to this bare fact; soon after their victory, however, we find the\r territory they had invaded divided into two kingdoms: in the north that\r of Bashan, which comprised, besides the Haurân, the plain watered by the\r Yarrnuk; and to the south that of Heshbon, containing the district lying\r around the Arnon, and the Jabbok to the east of the Dead Sea.* They seem\r to have made the same rapid progress in the country between the Jordan\r and the Mediterranean as elsewhere. They had subdued some of the small\r Canaanite states, entered into friendly relation with others, and\r penetrated gradually as far south as the borders of Sinai, while we find\r them establishing petty kings among the hill-country of Shechem around\r Hebron, on the confines of the Negeb, and the Shephelah.** When the\r Hebrew tribes ventured to push forward in a direct line northwards, they\r came into collision with the advance posts of the Amorite population,\r and suffered a severe defeat under the walls of Hormah.*** The check\r thus received, however, did not discourage them. As a direct course\r was closed to them, they turned to the right, and followed, first the\r southern and then the eastern shores of the Red Sea, till they reached\r the frontier of Gilead.****\r \r      * The extension of the Amorite power in this direction is\r      proved by the facts relating to the kingdoms of Sihon and Og\r      Gent. i. 4, ii. 24-37, iii. 1-1.7.\r \r      ** For the Amorite occupation of the Negeb and the hill-\r      country of Judah, cf.

The friendly welcome accorded\r      to them in the regions situated to the east of the Dead Sea,\r      has been accounted for either by an alliance made with Moab\r      and Ammon against their common enemy, the Amorites, or by\r      the fact that Ammon and Moab did not as yet occupy those\r      regions; the inhabitants in that case would have been\r      Edomites and Midianites, who were in continual warfare with\r      each other.\r \r There again they were confronted by the Amorites, but in lesser\r numbers, and not so securely entrenched within their fortresses as their\r fellow-countrymen in the Negeb, so that the Israelites were able to\r overthrow the kingdoms of Heshbon and Bashan.*\r \r      * War against Sihon, King of Heshbon (Numb. xxi. 21-31;\r      Beut. ii. 26-37), and against Og, King of Bashan (Numb. xxi.\r      32-35; Beut. iii. 1-13).\r \r [Illustration: 261.jpg THE VALLEY OF THE JABBOK, NEAR TO ITS CONFLUENCE\r WITH THE JORDAN]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from photograph No. 336 of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund._\r \r Gad received as its inheritance nearly the whole of the territory lying\r between the Jabbok and the Yarmuk, in the neighbourhood of the ancient\r native sanctuaries of Penuel, Mahanaim, and Succoth, associated with\r the memory of Jacob.* Reuben settled in the vicinity, and both tribes\r remained there isolated from the rest. From this time forward they took\r but a slight interest in the affairs of their brethren: when the latter\r demanded their succour, Gilead abode beyond Jordan, and by the\r watercourses of Reuben there were great resolves at heart, but without\r any consequent action.** It was not merely due to indifference on their\r part; their resources were fully taxed in defending themselves against\r the Aramæans and Bedawins, and from the attacks of Moab and Ammon.\r Gad, continually threatened, struggled for centuries without being\r discouraged, but Reuben lost heart,*** and soon declined in power, till\r at length he became merely a name in the memory of his brethren.\r \r      * Gad did not possess the districts between the Jabbok and\r      the Arnon till the time of the early kings, and retained\r      them only till about the reign of Jehu, as we gather from\r      the inscription of Mesa.\r \r      ** These are the very expressions used by the author of the\r      _Song of Deborah_ in Judges v. 16, 17.\r \r      *** The recollection of these raids by Reuben against the\r      Beduin of the Syrian desert is traceable in 1 Citron, v. 10,\r      18-22.\r \r Two tribes having been thus provided for, the bulk of the Israelites\r sought to cross the Jordan without further delay, and establish\r themselves as best they might in the very heart of the Canaanites. The\r sacred writings speak of their taking possession of the country by\r a methodic campaign, undertaken by command of and under the visible\r protection of Jahveh* Moses had led them from Egypt to Kadesh, and from\r Kadesh to the land of Gilead; he had seen the promised land from the\r summit of Mount Nebo, but he had not entered it, and after his death,\r Joshua, son of Nun, became their leader, brought them across Jordan\r dryshod, not far from its mouth, and laid siege to Jericho.\r \r      * The history of the conquest is to be found in the _Book of\r      Joshua._\r \r The walls of the city fell of themselves at the blowing of the brazen\r trumpets,* and its capture entailed that of three neighbouring towns,\r Aï, Bethel, and Shechem. Shechem served as a rallying-place for the\r conquerors; Joshua took up his residence there, and built on the summit\r of Mount Ebal an altar of stone, on which he engraved the principal\r tenets of the divine Law.**\r \r      * Josh, i.-vi.\r \r      ** Josh, vii., viii.

Properly speaking, there were no\r pitched battles between them, but rather a succession of raids or\r skirmishes, in which several citadels would successively fall into the\r hands of the invaders. Many of these strongholds, harassed by repeated\r attacks, would prefer to come to terms with the enemy, and would cede or\r sell them some portion of their territory; others would open their gates\r freely to the strangers, and their inhabitants would ally themselves by\r intermarriage with the Hebrews. Judah and the remaining descendants of\r Simeon and Levi established themselves in the south; Levi comprised but\r a small number of families, and made no important settlements; whereas\r Judah took possession of nearly the whole of the mountain district\r separating the Shephelah from the western shores of the Dead Sea, while\r Simeon made its abode close by on the borders of the desert around the\r wells of Beersheba.*\r \r      * Wellhausen has remarked that the lot of Levi must not be\r      separated from that of Simeon, and, as the remnant of Simeon\r      allied themselves with Judah, that of Levi also must have\r      shared the patrimony of Judah.\r \r The descendants of Rachel and her handmaid received as their inheritance\r the regions situated more to the centre of the country, the house of\r Joseph taking the best domains for its branches of Ephraim and Manasseh.\r Ephraim received some of the old Canaanite sanctuaries, such as Ramah,\r Bethel, and Shiloh, and it was at the latter spot that they deposited\r the ark of the covenant. Manasseh settled to the north of Ephraim, in\r the hills and valleys of the Carmel group, and to Benjamin were assigned\r the heights which overlook the plain of Jericho. Four of the less\r important tribes, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Zebulon, ventured\r as far north as the borders of Tyre and Sidon, behind the Phoenician\r littoral, but were prevented by the Canaanites and Amorites from\r spreading over the plain, and had to confine themselves to the\r mountains. All the fortresses commanding the passes of Tabor and\r Carmel, Megiddo, Taanach, Ibleam, Jezreel, Endor, and Bethshan remained\r inviolate, and formed as it were an impassable barrier-line between the\r Hebrews of Galilee and their brethren of Ephraim. The Danites were long\r before they found a resting-place; they attempted to insert themselves\r to the north of Judah, between Ajalon and Joppa, but were so harassed\r by the Amorites, that they had to content themselves with the precarious\r tenure of a few towns such as Zora, Shaalbîn, and Eshdol. The foreign\r peoples of the Shephelah and the Canaanite cities almost all preserved\r their autonomy; the Israelites had no chance against them wherever they\r had sufficient space to put into the field large bodies of infantry or\r to use their iron-bound chariots. Finding it therefore impossible to\r overcome them, the tribes were forced to remain cut off from each other\r in three isolated groups of unequal extent which they were powerless\r to connect: in the centre were Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan; in the south,\r Judah, Levi, and Simeon; while Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Zebulon\r lay to the north.\r \r The period following the occupation of Canaan constituted the heroic age\r of the Hebrews. The sacred writings agree in showing that the ties which\r bound the twelve tribes together were speedily dissolved, while their\r fidelity and obedience to God were relaxed with the growth of the young\r generations to whom Moses or Joshua were merely names. The conquerors\r dwelt among the Canaanites: the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the\r Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and they took their\r daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons,\r and served their gods. And the children of Israel did that which was\r evil in the sight of the Lord their God, and served the Baalim and the\r Asheroth. *\r \r [Illustration: 268.jpg MAP OF PALESTINE IN TIME OF THE JUDGES]\r \r When they had once abandoned their ancient faith, political unity was\r not long preserved. War broke out between one tribe and another; the\r stronger allowed the weaker to be oppressed by the heathen, and were\r themselves often powerless to retain their independence. In spite of the\r thousands of men among them, all able to bear arms, they fell an easy\r prey to the first comer; the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, and\r the Philistines, all oppressed them in turn, and repaid with usury the\r ills which Joshua had inflicted on the Canaanites. Whithersoever they\r went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord\r had spoken, and as the Lord had sworn unto them: and they were sore\r distressed. And the Lord raised up judges, which saved them out of the\r hand of those that spoiled them. And yet they hearkened not unto their\r judges, for they went a-whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves\r down unto them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their\r fathers walked obeying the commandments of the Lord; but they did not\r so. And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the\r judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of\r the judge: for it repented the Lord because of their groaning by reason\r of them that oppressed them and vexed them. But it came to pass, when\r the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than\r their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down\r unto them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn\r way. * The history of this period lacks the unity and precision with\r which we are at first tempted to credit it.\r \r      * Judges ii. 15-19.\r \r The Israelites, when transplanted into the promised land, did not\r immediately lose the nomadic habits they had acquired in the desert.\r They retained the customs and prejudices they had inherited from their\r fathers, and for many years treated the peasantry, whose fields they\r had devastated, with the same disdain that the Bedawin of our own day,\r living in the saddle, lance in hand, shows towards the fellahîn who till\r the soil and bend patiently over the plough. The clans, as of old,\r were impatient of all regular authority; each tribe tended towards an\r isolated autonomy, a state of affairs which merited reprisals from the\r natives and encouraged hatred of the intruders, and it was only when\r the Canaanite oppression became unendurable that those who suffered most\r from it united themselves to make a common effort, and rallied for\r a moment round the chief who was ready to lead them. Many of these\r liberators must have acquired an ephemeral popularity, and then have\r sunk into oblivion together with the two or three generations who had\r known them; those whose memory remained green among their kinsmen were\r known by posterity as the judges of Israel.*\r \r      * The word judges, which has been adopted to designate\r      these rulers, is somewhat misleading, as it suggests the\r      idea of an organized civil magistracy. The word shophet,\r       the same that we meet with in classical times under the form\r      _suffetes_, had indeed that sense, but its primary meaning\r      denotes a man invested with an absolute authority, regular\r      or otherwise; it would be better translated _chief, prince,\r      captain_.\r \r These judges were not magistrates invested with official powers and\r approved by the whole nation, or rulers of a highly organised republic,\r chosen directly by God or by those inspired by Him. They were merely\r local chiefs, heroes to their own immediate tribe, well known in their\r particular surroundings, but often despised by those only at a short\r distance from them. Some of them have left only a name behind them, such\r as Shamgar, Ibzan, Tola, Elon, and Abdon; indeed, some scholars have\r thrown doubts on the personality of a few of them, as, for instance,\r Jair, whom they affirm to have personified a Gileadite clan, and\r Othnîel, who is said to represent one of the Kenite families associated\r with the children of Israel.* Others, again, have come down to us\r through an atmosphere of popular tradition, the elements of which modern\r criticism has tried in vain to analyse. Of such unsettled and turbulent\r times we cannot expect an uninterrupted history:** some salient episodes\r alone remain, spread over a period of nearly two centuries, and from\r these we can gather some idea of the progress made by the Israelites,\r and observe their stages of transition from a cluster of semi-barbarous\r hordes to a settled nation ripe for monarchy.\r \r      * The name Tola occurs as that of one of the clans of\r      Issachar (Gen. xlvi. 13; Numb. xxvi. 23); Elon was one of\r      the clans of Zebulon (Gen. xlvi. 14; Numb. xxvi. 26)\r \r      ** Renan, however, believes that the judges formed an\r      almost continuous line, and that there merely lacks a\r      descent from father to son to make of them an actual\r      dynasty. The chronology of the _Book of Judges_ appears to\r      cover more than four centuries, from Othnîel to Samson, but\r      this computation cannot be relied on, as forty\r      years represents an indefinite space of time. We must\r      probably limit this early period of Hebrew history to about\r      a century and a half, from cir. 1200 to 1050 B.C.\r \r The first of these episodes deals merely with a part, and that the least\r important, of the tribes settled in Central Canaan.* The destruction of\r the Amorite kingdoms of Heshbon and Bashan had been as profitable to\r the kinsmen of the Israelites, Ammon and Moab, as it had been to the\r Israelites themselves.\r \r      * The episode of Othnîel and Cushan-rishathaim, placed at\r      the beginning of the history of this period (Judges iii. 8-\r      11), is, by general consent, regarded as resting on a\r      worthless tradition.\r \r The Moabites had followed in the wake of the Hebrews through all the\r surrounding regions of the Dead Sea; they had pushed on from the banks\r of the Arnon to those of the Jabbok, and at the time of the Judges were\r no longer content with harassing merely Reuben and Gad.\r \r [Illustration: 272.jpg MOABITE WARRIOR]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the original in the Louvre.\r \r They were a fine race of warlike, well-armed Beda-wins. Jericho had\r fallen into their hands, and their King Eglon had successfully scoured\r the entire hill-country of Ephraim,* so that those who wished to escape\r being pillaged had to safeguard themselves by the payment of an annual\r tribute.\r \r      * The text seems to infer (Judges iii. 13-15) that, after\r      having taken the Oily of Palm Trees, i.e. Jericho (Deut.\r      xxxiv. 3; 2 Ghron. xxviii. 15), Eglon had made it his\r      residence, which makes the story incomprehensible from a\r      geographical point of view. But all difficulties would\r      disappear if we agreed to admit that in ver. 15 the name of\r      the capital of Eglon has dropped out.\r \r Ehud the Left-handed concealed under his garments a keen dagger, and\r joined himself to the Benjamite deputies who were to carry their dues to\r the Moabite sovereign. The money having been paid, the deputies turned\r homewards, but when they reached the cromlech of Gilgal,* and were safe\r beyond the reach of the enemy, Ehud retraced his steps, and presenting\r himself before the palace of Eglon in the attitude of a prophet,\r announced that he had a secret errand to the king, who thereupon\r commanded silence, and ordered his servants to leave him with the divine\r messenger in his summer parlour.\r \r      * The cromlech at Gilgal was composed of twelve stones,\r      which, we are told, were erected by Joshua as a remembrance\r      of the crossing of the Jordan (Josh. iv. 19-24).\r \r And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of\r his seat. And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his\r right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: and the haft also went in\r after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the\r sword out of his belly; and it came out behind. Then Ehud locked the\r doors and escaped. Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and\r they saw, and, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked; and they\r said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. But by the\r time they had forced an entrance, Ehud had reached Gilgal and was in\r safety. He at once assembled the clans of Benjamin, occupied the fords\r of the Jordan, massacred the bands of Moabites scattered over the plain\r of Jericho, and blocked the routes by which the invaders attempted to\r reach the hill-country of Ephraim. Almost at the same time the tribes\r in Galilee had a narrow escape from a still more formidable enemy.* They\r had for some time been under the Amorite yoke, and the sacred writings\r represent them at this juncture as oppressed either by Sisera of\r Harosheth-ha-Goyîm or by a second Jabin, who was able to bring nine\r hundred chariots of iron into the field.** At length the prophetess\r Deborah of Issachar sent to Barak of Kadesh a command to assemble his\r people, together with those of Zebulon, in the name of the Lord;*** she\r herself led the contingents of Issachar, Ephraim, and Machir to meet him\r at the foot of Tabor, where the united host is stated to have comprised\r forty thousand men. Sisera,**** who commanded the Canaanite force,\r attacked the Israelite army between Taanach and Megiddo in that plain\r of Kishon which had often served as a battle-field during the Egyptian\r campaigns.\r \r      * The text tells us that, after the time of Ehud, the land\r      had rest eighty years (Judges iii. 30). This, again, is one\r      of those numbers which represent an indefinite space of\r      time.\r \r      ** It has been maintained that two versions are here blended\r      together in the text, one in which the principal part is\r      played by Sisera, the other in which it is attributed to\r      Jabin. The episode of Deborah and Barak (Judges iv., v.)\r      comprises a narrative in prose (chap, iv.), and the song\r      (chap, v.) attributed to Deborah. The prose account probably\r      is derived from the song. The differences in the two\r      accounts may be explained as having arisen partly from an\r      imperfect understanding of the poetic text, and partly from\r      one having come down from some other source.\r \r      *** Some critics suppose that the prose narrative (Judges\r      iv. 5) has confounded the prophetess Deborah, wife of\r      Lapidoth, with Deborah, nurse of Rachel, who was buried near\r      Bethel, under the Oak of Weeping (Gen. xxxv. 8), and\r      consequently place it between Rama and Bethel, in the hill-\r      country of Ephraim.\r \r      **** In the prose narrative (Judges iv. 2-7) Sisera is\r      stated to have been the general of Jabin: there is nothing\r      incompatible in this statement with the royal dignity\r      elsewhere attributed to Sisera. Harosheth-ha-Goyîm has been\r      identified with the present village of El-Haretîyeh, on the\r      right bank of the Kishon.\r \r It would appear that heavy rains had swelled the streams, and thus\r prevented the chariots from rendering their expected service in the\r engagement; at all events, the Amorites were routed, and Sisera escaped\r with the survivors towards Hazor.\r \r [Illustration: 275.jpg TELL]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph in Lortet.\r \r The people of Meroz facilitated his retreat, but a Kenite named Jael,\r the wife of Heber, traitorously killed him with a blow from a hammer\r while he was in the act of drinking.*\r \r      * Meroz is the present Marus, between the Lake of Huleh and\r      Safed. I have followed the account given in the song (Judges\r      v. 24-27). According to the prose version (iv. 17-22), Jael\r      slew Sisera while he was asleep with a tent-pin, which she\r      drove into his temple. [The text of Judges v. 24-27 does not\r      seem to warrant the view that he was slain in the act of\r      drinking, nor does it seem to conflict with Judges iv. 11.-\r      -Tr.]\r \r This exploit was commemorated in a song, the composition of which is\r attributed to Deborah and Barak: For that the leaders took the lead in\r Israel, for that the people offered themselves willingly, bless ye the\r Lord. Hear, O ye kings, give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing\r unto the Lord; I will sing praise to the Lord, the God of Israel. * The\r poet then dwells on the sufferings of the people, but tells how Deborah\r and Barak were raised up, and enumerates the tribes who took part in\r the conflict as well as those who turned a deaf ear to the appeal. Then\r came down a remnant of the nobles and the people.... Out of Ephraim\r came down they whose root is in Amalek:--out of Machir came down\r governors,--and out of Zebulon they that handle the marshals\r staff.--And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah--as was Issachar\r so was Barak,--into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.**--By the\r watercourses of Reuben--there were great resolves of heart.--Why satest\r thou among the sheepfolds,--to hear the pipings for the flocks?--At\r the watercourses of Reuben--there were great searchings of heart--Gilead\r abode beyond Jordan:--and Dan, why did he remain in ships?--Asher sat\r still at the haven of the sea--and abode by his creeks.--Zebulon was a\r people that jeoparded their lives unto the death,--and Naphtali upon the\r high places of the field.--The kings came and fought;--then fought the\r kings of Canaan.--In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo:--they took no\r gain of money.--They fought from heaven,--the stars in their courses\r fought against Sisera.--The river of Kishon swept them away,--that\r ancient river, the river Kishon.--O my soul, march on with\r strength.--Then did the horsehoofs stamp--by reason of the pransings,\r the pransings of their strong ones.\r \r      * Judges v. 2, 3 (R.V.).\r \r      ** The text of the song (Judges v. 14) contains an allusion\r      to Benjamin, which is considered by many critics to be an\r      interpolation. It gives a mistaken reading, _Issachar_ with\r      Barak; Issachar having been already mentioned with Deborah,\r      probably Zébulon should be inserted in the text.\r \r Sisera flies, and the poet follows him in fancy, as if he feared to see\r him escape from vengeance. He curses the people of Meroz in passing,\r because they came not to the help of the Lord. He addresses Jael and\r blesses her, describing the manner in which the chief fell at her feet,\r and then proceeds to show how, at the very time of Siseras death, his\r people were awaiting the messenger who should bring the news of his\r victory; through the window she looked forth and cried--the mother\r of Sisera cried through the lattice--Why is his chariot so long in\r coming?--Why tarry the wheels of his chariot?--Her wise ladies answered\r her,--yea, she returned answer to herself,--Have they not found, have\r they not divided the spoil?--A damsel, two damsels to every man;--to\r Sisera a spoil of divers colours,--a spoil of divers colours of\r embroidery on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?--So let all Thine\r enemies perish, O Lord:--but let them that love Him be as the sun when\r he goeth forth in his might.\r \r It was the first time, as far as we know, that several of the Israelite\r tribes combined together for common action after their sojourn in the\r desert of Kadesh-barnea, and the success which followed from their\r united efforts ought, one would think, to have encouraged them to\r maintain such a union, but it fell out otherwise; the desire for freedom\r of action and independence was too strong among them to permit of the\r continuance of the coalition.\r \r [Illustration: 278.jpg MOUNT TABOR]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by M. C. Alluaud\r      of Limoges.\r \r Manasseh, restricted in its development by the neighbouring Canaanite\r tribes, was forced to seek a more congenial neighbourhood to the east of\r the Jordan--not close to Gad, in the land of Gilead, but to the north\r of the Yarmuk and its northern affluents in the vast region extending\r to the mountains of the Haurân. The families of Machir and Jair migrated\r one after the other to the east of the Lake of Gennesaret, while that\r of Nobah proceeded as far as the brook of Kanah, and thus formed in this\r direction the extreme outpost of the children of Israel: these families\r did not form themselves into new tribes, for they were mindful of\r their affiliation to Manasseh, and continued beyond the river to\r regard themselves still as his children.* The prosperity of Ephraim and\r Manasseh, and the daring nature of their exploits, could not fail\r to draw upon them the antagonism and jealousy of the people on their\r borders. The Midianites were accustomed almost every year to pass\r through the region beyond the Jordan which the house of Joseph had\r recently colonised. Assembling in the springtime at the junction of the\r Yarmuk with the Jordan, they crossed the latter river, and, spreading\r over the plains of Mount Tabor, destroyed the growing crops, raided the\r villages, and pushed, sometimes, their skirmishing parties over hill and\r dale as far as Gaza.**\r \r      * Manasseh was said to have been established beyond the\r      Jordan at the time that Gad and Reuben were in possession of\r      the land of Gilead (Numb, xxxii. 33, 39-42, xxxiv. 14, 15;\r      Dent. iii. 13-15; Josh. xiii. 8, 29-32, xxii.). Earlier\r      traditions placed this event in the period which followed\r      the conquest of Canaan by Joshua. It is not certain that all\r      the families which constituted the half-tribe of Manasseh\r      took their origin from Manasseh: one of them, for example,\r      that of Jair, was regarded as having originated partly from\r      Judah (1 Chron. ii. 21-24).\r \r      ** Judges vi. 2-6. The inference that they dare not beat\r      wheat in the open follows from ver. 11, where it is said\r      that Gideon was beating out wheat in his winepress to hide\r      it from the Midianites.\r \r A perpetual terror reigned wherever they were accustomed to pass*: no\r one dared beat out wheat or barley in the open air, or lead his herds to\r pasture far from his home, except under dire necessity; and even on such\r occasions the inhabitants would, on the slightest alarm, abandon their\r possessions to take refuge in caves or in strongholds on the mountains.1\r During one of these incursions two of their sheikhs encountered some\r men of noble mien in the vicinity of Tabor, and massacred them without\r compunction.** The latter were people of Ophrah,*** brethren of a\r certain Jerubbaal (Gideon) who was head of the powerful family of\r Abiezer.****\r \r      * The history of the Midianite oppression (Judges vi.-viii.)\r      seems to be from two different sources; the second (Judges\r      viii. 4-21), which is also the shortest, is considered by\r      some to represent the more ancient tradition. The double\r      name of the hero, Gideon-Jerubbaal, has led some to assign\r      its elements respectively to Gideon, judge of the western\r      portion of Manasseh, and Jerubbaal, judge of the eastern\r      Manasseh, and to the consequent fusion of the two men in\r      one.\r \r      ** This is an assumption which follows reasonably from\r      Judges viii. 18, 19.\r \r      *** The site of the Ophrah of Abiezer is not known for\r      certain, but it would seem from the narrative that it was in\r      the neighbourhood of Shechem.\r \r      **** The position of Gideon-Jerubbaal as head of the house\r      of Abiezer follows clearly from the narrative; if he is\r      represented in the first part of the account as a man of\r      humble origin (Judges vi. 15, 16), it was to exalt the power\r      of Jahveh, who was accustomed to choose His instruments from\r      amongst the lowly. The name Jerubbaal (1 Sam. xii. 11:2 Sam.\r      xi. 21, where the name is transformed into Jerubbesheth, as\r      Ishbaal and Meribbaal are into Ishbosheth and Mephibosheth\r      respectively), in which Baal seems to some not to\r      represent the Canaanite God, but the title Lord as applied\r      to Jahveh, was supposed to mean Baal fights against him,\r       and was, therefore, offensive to the orthodox. Kuenen\r      thought it meant Lord, fight for him! Renan read it\r      Yarebaal, from the Vulgate form Jerobaal, and translated He\r      who fears Baal. Gideon signifies He who overthrows in the\r      battle.\r \r Assembling all his people at the call of the trumpet, Jerubbaal chose\r from among them three hundred of the strongest, with whom he came\r down unexpectedly upon the raiders, put them to flight in the plain of\r Jezreel, and followed them beyond the Jordan. Having crossed the river,\r faint and yet pursuing, he approached the men of Succoth, and asked\r them for bread for himself and his three hundred followers. Their fear\r of the marauders, however, was so great that the people refused to give\r him any help, and he had no better success with the people of Penuel\r whom he encountered a little further on. He did not stop to compel them\r to accede to his wishes, but swore to inflict an exemplary punishment\r upon them on his return. The Midianites continued their retreat, in the\r mean time, by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of\r Nobah and Jogbehah, but Jerubbaal came up with them near Karkâr, and\r discomfited the host. He took vengeance upon the two peoples who had\r refused to give him bread, and having thus fulfilled his vow, he began\r to question his prisoners, the two chiefs: What manner of men were they\r whom ye slew at Tabor? As thou art, so were they; each one resembled\r the children of a king. And he said, They were my brethren, the sons\r of my mother: as the Lord liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would\r not slay you. And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them.\r But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a\r youth. True Bedawins as they were, the chiefs pride revolted at the\r idea of their being handed over for execution to a child, and they cried\r to Jerubbaal: Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is\r his strength. From this victory rose the first monarchy among the\r Israelites. The Midianites, owing to their marauding habits and the\r amount of tribute which they were accustomed to secure for escorting\r caravans, were possessed of a considerable quantity of gold, which they\r lavished on the decoration of their persons: their chiefs were clad in\r purple mantles, their warriors were loaded with necklaces, bracelets,\r rings, and ear-rings, and their camels also were not behind their\r masters in the brilliance of their caparison. The booty which Gideon\r secured was, therefore, considerable, and, as we learn from the\r narrative, excited the envy of the Ephraimites, who said: Why hast thou\r served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight\r with Midian? *\r \r      * Judges viii. 1-3.\r \r The spoil from the golden ear-rings alone amounted to one thousand seven\r hundred shekels, as we learn from the narrative, and this treasure in\r the hands of Jerubbaal was not left unemployed, but was made, doubtless,\r to contribute something to the prestige he had already acquired: the\r men of Israel, whom he had just saved from their foes, expressed their\r gratitude by offering the crown to him and his successors. The mode of\r life of the Hebrews had been much changed after they had taken up their\r abode in the mountains of Canaan. The tent had given place to the house,\r and, like their Canaanite neighbours, they had given themselves up\r to agricultural pursuits. This change of habits, in bringing about\r a greater abundance of the necessaries of life than they had been\r accustomed to, had begotten aspirations which threw into relief the\r inadequacy of the social organisation, and of the form of government\r with which they had previously been content. In the case of a horde\r of nomads, defeat or exile would be of little moment. Should they be\r obliged by a turn in their affairs to leave their usual haunts, a few\r days or often a few hours would suffice to enable them to collect\r their effects together, and set out without trouble, and almost\r without regret, in search of a new and more favoured home. But with\r a cultivator of the ground the case would be different: the farm,\r clearings, and homestead upon which he had spent such arduous and\r continued labour; the olive trees and vines which had supplied him\r with oil and wine--everything, in fact, upon which he depended for a\r livelihood, or which was dependent upon him, would bind him to the soil,\r and expose his property to disasters likely to be as keenly felt as\r wounds inflicted on his person. He would feel the need, therefore,\r of laws to secure to him in time of peace the quiet possession of his\r wealth, of an army to protect it in time of war, and of a ruler to\r cause, on the one hand, the laws to be respected, and to become the\r leader, on the other, of the military forces. Jerubbaal is said to have,\r in the first instance, refused the crown, but everything goes to prove\r that he afterwards virtually accepted it. He became, it is true, only\r a petty king, whose sovereignty was limited to Manasseh, a part of\r Ephraim, and a few towns, such as Succoth and Penuel, beyond the Jordan.\r The Canaanite city of Shechem also paid him homage. Like all great\r chiefs, he had also numerous wives, and he recognised as the national\r Deity the God to whom he owed his victories.\r \r Out of the spoil taken from the Midianites he formed and set up at\r Ophrah an ephod, which became, as we learn, a snare unto him and unto\r his house, but he had also erected under a terebinth tree a stone altar\r to Jahveh-Shalom (Jehovah is peace).* This sanctuary, with its altar\r and ephod, soon acquired great celebrity, and centuries after its\r foundation it was the object of many pilgrimages from a distance.\r \r Jerubbaal was the father by his Israelite wives of seventy children,\r and, by a Canaanite woman whom he had taken as a concubine at Shechem,\r of one son, called Abimelech.**\r \r      * The _Book of Judges_ separates the altar from the ephod,\r      placing the erection of the former at the time of the\r      vocation of Gideon (vi. 11-31) and that of the ephod after\r      the victory (viii. 24-27). The sanctuary of Ophrah was\r      possibly in existence before the time of Jerubbaal, and the\r      sanctity of the place may have determined his selection of\r      the spot for placing the altar and ephod there.\r \r      ** Judges viii. 30, 31.\r \r The succession to the throne would naturally have fallen to one of the\r seventy, but before this could be arranged, Abimelech went to Shechem\r unto his mothers brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family\r of the house of his mothers father, saying, Speak, I pray you, in the\r ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the\r sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, rule over you,\r or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your\r flesh. This advice was well received; it flattered the vanity of the\r people to think that the new king was to be one of themselves; their\r hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.\r And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house\r of Baal-berith (the Lord of the Covenant), wherewith Abimelech hired\r vain and light fellows, which followed him.... He slew his brethren the\r sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone.\r  The massacre having been effected, all the men of Shechem assembled\r themselves together, and all the house of Millo,* and made Abimelech\r king, by the oak of the pillar which was in Shechem. ** He dwelt at\r Ophrah, in the residence, and near the sanctuary, of his father, and\r from thence governed the territories constituting the little kingdom\r of Manasseh, levying tribute upon the vassal villages, and exacting\r probably tolls from caravans passing through his domain.\r \r      * The word Millo is a generic term, meaning citadel or\r      stronghold of the city: there was a Millo in every important\r      town, Jerusalem included.\r \r      ** The oak of the pillar was a sacred tree overshadowing\r      probably a _cippus_: it may have been the tree mentioned in\r      Gen. xxxv. 4, under which Jacob buried the strange gods; or\r      that referred to in Josh. xxiv. 26, under which Joshua set\r      up a stone commemorative of the establishment of the law.\r      Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon, escaped the massacre. As\r      soon as he heard of the election of Abimelech, he ascended\r      Mount Gerizim, and gave out from there the fable of the\r      trees, applying it to the circumstances of the time, and\r      then fled. Some critics think that this fable--which is\r      confessedly old--was inserted in the text at a time when\r      prophetical ideas prevailed and monarchy was not yet\r      accepted.\r \r This condition of things lasted for three years, and then the\r Shechemites, who had shown themselves so pleased at the idea of having\r one of their brethren as sovereign, found it irksome to pay the taxes\r levied upon them by him, as if they were in no way related to him. The\r presence among them of a certain Zebul, the officer and representative\r of Abimelech, restrained them at first from breaking out into rebellion,\r but they returned soon to their ancient predatory ways, and demanded\r ransom for the travellers they might capture even when the latter were\r in possession of the kings safe conduct. This was not only an insult to\r their lord, but a serious blow to his treasury: the merchants who found\r themselves no longer protected by his guarantee employed elsewhere the\r sums which would have come into his hands. The king concealed his anger,\r however; he was not inclined to adopt premature measures, for the place\r was a strong one, and defeat would seriously weaken his prestige. The\r people of Shechem, on their part, did not risk an open rupture for fear\r of the consequences. Gaal, son of Ebed,* a soldier of fortune and of\r Israelitish blood, arrived upon the scene, attended by his followers: he\r managed to gain the confidence of the people of Shechem, who celebrated\r under his protection the feast of the Vintage.\r \r      * The name Ebed (slave, servant) is assumed to have been\r      substituted in the Massorotic text for the original name\r      Jobaal, because of the element Baal in the latter word,\r      which was regarded as that of the strange god, and would\r      thus have the sacrilegious meaning Jahveh is Baal. The term\r      of contempt, Ebed, was, according to this view, thus used to\r      replace it.\r \r On this occasion their merrymaking was disturbed by the presence among\r them of the officer charged with collecting the tithes, and Gaal did not\r lose the opportunity of stimulating their ire by his ironical speeches:\r Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is\r not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of\r Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him? And would to\r God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And\r he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out. Zebul promptly\r gave information of this to his master, and invited him to come by night\r and lie in ambush in the vicinity of the town, that in the morning,\r as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city:\r and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against\r thee, thou mayest do to them as thou shalt find occasion. It turned out\r as he foresaw; the inhabitants of Shechem went out in order to take part\r in the gathering in of the vintage, while Gaal posted his men at the\r entering in of the gate of the city. As he looked towards the hills he\r thought he saw an unusual movement among the trees, and, turning round,\r said to Zebul, who was close by, Behold, there come people down from\r the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the\r shadow of the mountains as if they were men. A moment after he looked\r in another direction, and spake again and said, See, there come people\r down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of\r the terebinth of the augurs. Zebul, seeing the affair turn out so well,\r threw off the mask, and replied railingly, Where is now thy mouth,\r wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is\r not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray, now, and\r fight with him. The King of Manasseh had no difficulty in defeating\r his adversary, but arresting the pursuit at the gates of the city, he\r withdrew to the neighbouring village of Arumah.*\r \r      * This is now el-Ormeh, i.e.Kharbet el-Eurmah, to the south-\r      west of Nablus.\r \r He trusted that the inhabitants, who had taken no part in the affair,\r would believe that his wrath had been appeased by the defeat of Gaal;\r and so, in fact, it turned out: they dismissed their unfortunate\r champion, and on the morrow returned to their labours as if nothing had\r occurred.\r \r [Illustration: 288.jpg MOUNT GERIZIM, WITH A VIEW OF NABLUS]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph reproduced by the Duc de\r      Luynes.\r \r Abimelech had arranged his Abiezerites in three divisions: one of\r which made for the gates, while the other two fell upon the scattered\r labourers in the vineyards. Abimelech then fought against the city and\r took it, but the chief citizens had taken refuge in the hold of the\r house of El-berith. Abimelech gat him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all\r the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand,\r and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his\r shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye\r have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done. And all the people\r likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put\r them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the\r men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.\r \r [Illustration: 289.jpg THE TOWN OF ASCALON]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief in the Ramesseum.\r      This is a portion of the picture representing the capture of\r      Ascalon by Ramses II.\r \r This summary vengeance did not, however, prevent other rebellions.\r Thebez imitated Shechem, and came nigh suffering the same penalty.* The\r king besieged the city and took it, and was about to burn with fire the\r tower in which all the people of the city had taken refuge, when a woman\r threw a millstone down upon his head and brake his skull.\r \r      * Thebez, now Tubas, the north-east of Nablus.\r \r The narrative tells us that, feeling himself mortally wounded, he called\r his armour-bearer to him, and said, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that\r men say not of me, A woman slew him. His monarchy ceased with him, and\r the ancient chronicler recognises in the catastrophe a just punishment\r for the atrocious crime he had committed in slaying his half-brothers,\r the seventy children of Jerubbaal.* His fall may be regarded also as\r the natural issue of his peculiar position: the resources upon which he\r relied were inadequate to secure to him a supremacy in Israel. Manasseh,\r now deprived of a chief, and given up to internal dissensions, became\r still further enfeebled, and an easy prey to its rivals. The divine\r writings record in several places the success attained by the central\r tribes in their conflict with their enemies. They describe how a certain\r Jephthah distinguished himself in freeing Gilead from the Ammonites.**\r \r      * Judges ix. 23, 24. And God sent an evil spirit between\r      Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem\r      dealt treacherously with Abimelech: that the violence done\r      to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and\r      that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother,\r      which slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, which\r      strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.\r \r      ** The story of Jephthah is contained in chaps, xi., xii. 1-\r      7, of the _Book of Judges_. The passage (xi. 12-29) is\r      regarded by some, owing to its faint echo of certain\r      portions of Numb, xx., xxi., to be an interpolation.\r      Jephthah is said to have had Gilead for his father and a\r      harlot for his mother. Various views have been put forward\r      as to the account of his victories over the Midianites, some\r      seeing in it, as well as in the origin of the four\r      daysfeast in honour of Jephthahs daughter, insertions of a\r      later date.\r \r But his triumph led to the loss of his daughter, whom he sacrificed in\r order to fulfil a vow he had made to Jahveh before the battle.* These\r were, however, comparatively unimportant episodes in the general history\r of the Hebrew race. Bedawins from the East, sheikhs of the Midianites,\r Moabites, and Ammonites--all these marauding peoples of the frontier\r whose incursions are put on record--gave them continual trouble, and\r rendered their existence so miserable that they were unable to develop\r their institutions and attain the permanent freedom after which they\r aimed. But their real dangers--the risk of perishing altogether, or of\r falling back into a condition of servitude--did not arise from any of\r these quarters, but from the Philistines.\r \r      * There are two views as to the nature of the sacrifice of\r      Jephthahs daughter. Some think she was vowed to perpetual\r      virginity, while others consider that she was actually\r      sacrificed.\r \r By a decree of Pharaoh, a new country had been assigned to the remnants\r of each of the maritime peoples: the towns nearest to Egypt, lying\r between Raphia and Joppa, were given over to the Philistines, and the\r forest region and the coast to the north of the Philistines, as far as\r the Phoenician stations of Dor and Carmel,* were appropriated to the\r Zakkala. The latter was a military colony, and was chiefly distributed\r among the five fortresses which commanded the Shephelah.\r \r      * We are indebted to the _Papyrus Golenischeff_ for the\r      mention of the position of the Zakkala at the beginning of\r      the XXIst dynasty.\r \r [Illustration: 292.jpg A ZAKKALA]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a squeeze.\r \r Gaza and Ashdod were separated from the Mediterranean by a line of\r sand-dunes, and had nothing in the nature of a sheltered port--nothing,\r in fact, but a maiuma, or open roadstead, with a few dwellings and\r storehouses arranged along the beach on which their boats were drawn\r up. Ascalon was built on the sea, and its harbour, although well enough\r suited for the small craft of the ancients, could not have been entered\r by the most insignificant of our modern ships. The Philistines had here\r their naval arsenal, where their fleets were fitted out for scouring\r the Egyptian waters as a marine police, or for piratical expeditions\r on their own account, when the occasion served, along the coasts of\r Phoenicia. Ekron and Gath kept watch over the eastern side of the plain\r at the points where it was most exposed to the attacks of the people\r of the hills--the Canaanites in the first instance, and afterwards\r the Hebrews. These foreign warriors soon changed their mode of life in\r contact with the indigenous inhabitants; daily intercourse, followed up\r by marriages with the daughters of the land, led to the substitution of\r the language, manners, and religion of the environing race for those of\r their mother country. The Zakkala, who were not numerous, it is true,\r lost everything, even to their name, and it was all that the Philistines\r could do to preserve their own. At the end of one or two generations,\r the colts of Palestine could only speak the Canaanite tongue, in which\r a few words of the old Hellenic _patois_ still continued to survive.\r Their gods were henceforward those of the towns in which they resided,\r such as Marna and Dagon and Gaza,* Dagon at Ashdod,** Baalzebub at\r Ekron,*** and Derketô in Ascalon;**** and their mode of worship, with\r its mingled bloody and obscene rites, followed that of the country.\r \r      * Marna, our lord, is mentioned alongside Baalzephon in a\r      list of strange gods worshipped at Memphis in the XIXth\r      dynasty. The worship of Dagon at Gaza is mentioned in the\r      story of Samson (Judges xvi. 21-30).\r \r      ** The temple and statue of Dagon are mentioned in the\r      account of the events following the taking of the ark in 1\r      Sam. v. 1-7. It is, perhaps, to him that 1 Chron. x. 10\r      refers, in relating how the Philistines hung up Sauls arms\r      in the house of their gods, although 1 Sam. xxxi. 10 calls\r      the place the house of the Ashtoreth.\r \r      *** Baalzebub was the god of Ekron (2 Kings i. 2-6), and his\r      name was doubtfully translated Lord of Flies. The\r      discovery of the name of the town Zebub on the Tell el-\r      Amarna tablets shows that it means the Baal of Zebub.\r       Zebub was situated in the Philistine plains, not far from\r      Ekron. Halévy thinks it may have been a suburb of that town.\r \r      **** The worship of Derketô or Atergatis at Ascalon is\r      witnessed to by the classical writers.\r \r [Illustration: 294.jpg A PROCESSION OF PHILISTINE CAPTIVES AT\r MEDINET-HABU]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.\r \r Two things belonging to their past history they still retained--a clear\r remembrance of their far-off origin, and that warlike temperament which\r had enabled them to fight their way through many obstacles from the\r shores of the Ægean to the frontiers of Egypt. They could recall\r their island of Caphtor,* and their neighbours in their new home were\r accustomed to bestow upon them the designation of Cretans, of which they\r themselves were not a little proud.**\r \r      * Jer. xlvii. 4 calls them the remnant of the isle of\r      Caphtor; Amos (ix. 7) knew that the Lord had brought the\r      Philistines from Caphtor; and in Dent. ii. 23 it is related\r      how the Caphtorim which came forth out of Caphtor destroyed\r      the Avvim, which dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, and dwelt\r      in their stead. Classical tradition falls in with the sacred\r      record, and ascribes a Cretan origin to the Philistines; it\r      is suggested, therefore, that in Gen. x. 14 the names\r      Casluhim and Caphtorim should be transposed, to bring the\r      verse into harmony with history and other parts of\r      Scripture.\r \r      ** In an episode in the life of David (1 Sam. xxx. 14),\r      there is mention of the south of the Cherethites, which\r      some have made to mean Cretans--that is to say, the region\r      to the south of the Philistines, alongside the territory of\r      Judah, and to the south of Caleb. Ezelc. xx. 16 also\r      mentions in juxtaposition with the Philistines the\r      Cherethites, and the remnant of the sea-coast, as objects\r      of Gods vengeance for the many evils they had inflicted on\r      Israel. By the Cherethims here, and the Cherethites in Zoph.\r      ii. 5, the Cretans are by some thought to be meant, which\r      would account for their association with the Philistines.\r \r Gaza enjoyed among them a kind of hegemony, alike on account of its\r strategic position and its favourable situation for commerce, but this\r supremacy was of very precarious character, and brought with it no\r right whatever to meddle in the internal affairs of other members of the\r confederacy. Each of the latter had a chief of its own, a Seren,* and\r the office of this chief was hereditary in one case at least--Gath, for\r instance, where there existed a larger Canaanite element than elsewhere,\r and was there identified with that of melek, ** or king.\r \r      * The _sarnê plishtîm_ figure in the narrative of the last\r      Philistine campaign against Saul (1 Sam. xxix. 2-4, 7, 9).\r      Their number, five, is expressly mentioned in 1 Sam. vi. 4,\r      16-18, as well as the names of the towns over which they\r      ruled.\r \r      ** Achish was King of Gath (1 Sam. xxi. 10, 12, xxvii. 2),\r      and probably Maoch before him.\r \r The five Sarnîm assembled in council to deliberate upon common\r interests, and to offer sacrifices in the name of the Pentapolis. These\r chiefs were respectively free to make alliances, or to take the field\r on their own account, but in matters of common importance they acted\r together, and took their places each at the head of his own contingent.*\r Their armies were made up of regiments of skilled archers and of\r pikemen, to whom were added a body of charioteers made up of the princes\r and the nobles of the nation. The armour for all alike was the coat\r of scale mail and the helmet of brass; their weapons consisted of the\r two-edged battle-axe, the bow, the lance, and a large and heavy sword of\r bronze or iron.**\r \r      * Achish, for example, King of Gath, makes war alone against\r      the pillaging tribes, owing to the intervention of David and\r      his men, without being called to account by the other\r      princes (1 Sam. xxvii. 2-12, xxviii. 1, 2), but as soon as\r      an affair of moment is in contemplation--such as the war\r      against Saul--they demand the dismissal of David, and Achish\r      is obliged to submit to his colleagues acting together (1\r      Sam. xxix.).\r \r      ** Philistine archers are mentioned in the battle of Gilboa\r      (1 Sam. xxxi. 3) as well as chariots (2 Sam. i. 6). The\r      horsemen mentioned in the same connexion are regarded by\r      some critics as an interpolation, because they cannot bring\r      themselves to think that the Philistines had cavalry corps\r      in the Xth century B.C. The Philistine arms are described at\r      length in the duel between David and Goliath (1 Sam. xvii. 5\r      -7, 38, 39). They are in some respects like those of the\r      Homeric heroes.\r \r Their war tactics were probably similar to those of the Egyptians, who\r were unrivalled in military operations at this period throughout the\r whole East. Under able leadership, and in positions favourable for the\r operations of their chariots, the Philistines had nothing to fear from\r the forces which any of their foes could bring up against them. As to\r their maritime history, it is certain that in the earliest period,\r at least, of their sojourn in Syria, as well as in that before their\r capture by Ramses III., they were successful in sea-fights, but the\r memory of only one of their expeditions has come down to us: a squadron\r of theirs having sailed forth from Ascalon somewhere towards the end\r of the XIIth dynasty,* succeeded in destroying the Sidonian fleet, and\r pillaging Sidon itself.\r \r      * _Justinus_, xviii. 3, § 5. The memory of this has been\r      preserved, owing to the disputes about precedence which\r      raged in the Greek period between the Phoenician towns. The\r      destruction of Sidon must have allowed Tyre to develop and\r      take the first place.\r \r [Illustration: 297.jpg A PHILISTINE SHIP OF WAR]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.\r \r But however vigorously they may have plied the occupation of Corsairs at\r the outset of their career, there was, it would appear, a rapid falling\r off in their maritime prowess; it was on land, and as soldiers, that\r they displayed their bravery and gained their fame. Their geographical\r position, indeed, on the direct and almost only route for caravans\r passing between Asia and Africa, must have contributed to their success.\r The number of such caravans was considerable, for although Egypt had\r ceased to be a conquering nation on account of her feebleness at home,\r she was still one of the great centres of production, and the most\r important market of the East. A very great part of her trade with\r foreign countries was carried on through the mouths of the Nile, and of\r this commerce the Phoenicians had made themselves masters; the remainder\r followed the land-routes, and passed continually through the territory\r of the Philistines. These people were in possession of the tract of land\r which lay between the Mediterranean and the beginning of the southern\r desert, forming as it were a narrow passage, into which all the roads\r leading from the Nile to the Euphrates necessarily converged. The chief\r of these routes was that which crossed Mount Carmel, near Megiddo, and\r passed up the valleys of the Litâny and the Orontes. This was met\r at intervals by other secondary roads, such as that which came from\r Damascus by way of Tabor and the plain of Jezreel, or those which,\r starting out from the highland of Gilead, led through the fords of the\r Lower Jordan to Ekron and Gath respectively. The Philistines charged\r themselves, after the example and at the instigation of the Egyptians,\r with the maintenance of the great trunk road which was in their hands,\r and also with securing safe transit along it, as far as they could\r post their troops, for those who confided themselves to their care. In\r exchange for these good offices they exacted the same tolls which had\r been levied by the Canaanites before them.\r \r In their efforts to put down brigandage, they had been brought into\r contact with some of the Hebrew clans after the latter had taken\r possession of Canaan. Judah, in its home among the mountains of the\r Dead Sea, had become acquainted with the diverse races which were found\r there, and consequently there had been frequent intermarriages between\r the Hebrews and these peoples. Some critics have argued from this that\r the chronicler had this fact in his mind when he assigned a Canaanite\r wife, Shuah, to the father of the tribe himself. He relates how Judah,\r having separated from his brethren, turned in to a certain Adullamite,\r whose name was Hiram, and that here he became acquainted with Shuah,\r by whom he had three sons. With Tamar, the widow of the eldest of the\r latter, he had accidental intercourse, and two children, Perez and\r Zerah, the ancestors of numerous families, were born of that union.*\r \r      * Gen. xxxviii., where there is a detailed account of\r      Judahs unions.\r \r Edomites, Arabs, and Midianites were associated with this semi-Canaanite\r stock--for example, Kain, Caleb, Othniel, Kenaz, Shobal, Ephah, and\r Jerahmeel, but the Kenites took the first place among them, and played\r an important part in the history of the conquest of Canaan. It is\r related how one of their subdivisions, of which Caleb was the eponymous\r hero, had driven from Hebron the three sons of Anak--Sheshai, Ahiman,\r and Talmai--and had then promised his daughter Achsah in marriage to\r him who should capture Debir; this turned out to be his youngest brother\r Othniel, who captured the city, and at the same time obtained a\r wife. Hobab, another Kenite, who is represented to have been the\r brother-in-law of Moses, occupied a position to the south of Arad, in\r Idumsean territory.* These heterogeneous elements existed alongside each\r other for a long time without intermingling; they combined, however, now\r and again to act against a common foe, for we know that the people\r of Judah aided the tribe of Simeon in the reduction of the city of\r Zephath;** but they followed an independent course for the most part,\r and their isolation prevented their obtaining, for a lengthened period,\r any extension of territory.\r \r      * The father-in-law of Moses is called Jethro in Exod. iii.\r      1, iv. 19, but Raguel in Exod. ii. 18-22. Hobab is the son\r      of Raguel, Numb. x. 29.\r \r      ** Judges i. 17, where Zephath is the better reading, and\r      not Arad, as has been suggested.\r \r They failed, as at first, in their attempts to subjugate the province of\r Arad, and in their efforts to capture the fortresses which guarded\r the caravan routes between Ashdod and the mouth of the Jordan. It\r is related, however, that they overthrew Adoni-bezek, King of the\r Jebusites, and that they had dealt with him as he was accustomed to deal\r with his prisoners. And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings,\r having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat\r under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. Although\r Adoni-bezek had been overthrown, Jerusalem still remained independent,\r as did also Gibeon. Beeroth, Kirjath-Jearim, Ajalon, Gezer, and\r the cities of the plain, for the Israelites could not drive out the\r inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron, with which\r the Hebrew foot-soldiers found it difficult to deal.* This independent\r and isolated group was not at first, however, a subject of anxiety\r to the masters of the coast, and there is but a bare reference to\r the exploits of a certain Shamgar, son of Anath, who smote of the\r Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad. **\r \r      * See Josh. ix. 3-27 for an explanation of how these people\r      were allowed afterwards to remain in a subordinate capacity\r      among the children of Israel.\r \r      ** Judges iii. 31; cf. also Judges v. 6, in which Shamgar is\r      mentioned in the song of Deborah.\r \r [Illustration: 301.jpg TELL ES-SAFIEH, THE GATH OF THE PHILISTINES]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from photograph No. 265 of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund._\r \r These cities had also to reckon with Ephraim, and the tribes which had\r thrown in their lot with her. Dan had cast his eyes upon the northern\r districts of the Shephelah--which were dependent upon Ekron or Gath--and\r also upon the semi-Phoenician port of Joppa; but these tribes did not\r succeed in taking possession of those districts, although they had\r harassed them from time to time by raids in which the children of Israel\r did not always come off victorious. One of their chiefs--Samson--had a\r great reputation among them for his bravery and bodily strength. But the\r details of his real prowess had been forgotten at an early period.\r The episodes which have been preserved deal with some of his exploits\r against the Philistines, and there is a certain humour in the\r chroniclers account of the weapons which he employed: with the jawbone\r of an ass have I smitten a thousand men; he burned up their harvest\r also by letting go three hundred foxes, with torches attached to their\r tails, among the standing corn of the Philistines. Various events in his\r career are subsequently narrated; such as his adventure in the house\r of the harlot at Gaza, when he carried off the gate of the city and\r the gate-posts to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron. By\r Delilahs treachery he was finally delivered over to his enemies, who,\r having put out his eyes, condemned him to grind in the prison-house. On\r the occasion of a great festival in honour of Dagon, he was brought into\r the temple to amuse his captors, but while they were making merry at his\r expense, he took hold of the two pillars against which he was resting,\r and bowing himself with all his might, overturned them, and the house\r fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. *\r \r      * Some learned critics considered Samson to have been a sort\r      of solar deity.\r \r The tribe of Dan at length became weary of these unprofitable\r struggles, and determined to seek out another and more easily defensible\r settlement. They sent out five emissaries, therefore, to look out for\r a new home. While these were passing through the mountains they called\r upon a certain Michah in the hill-country of Ephraim and lodged there.\r Here they took counsel of a Levite whom Michah had made his priest, and,\r in answer to the question whether their journey would be prosperous, he\r told them to Go in peace: before the Lord is the way wherein ye go.\r  Their search turned out successful, for they discovered near the sources\r of the Jordan the town of Laish, whose people, like the Zidonians, dwelt\r in security, fearing no trouble. On the report of the emissaries, Dan\r decided to emigrate: the warriors set out to the number of six hundred,\r carried off by the way the ephod of Micah and the Levite who served\r before it, and succeeded in capturing Laish, to which they gave the\r name of their tribe. They there set up for themselves the ephod: and\r Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were\r priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of\r the land. * The tribe of Dan displayed in this advanced post of peril\r the bravery it had shown on the frontiers of the Shephelah, and showed\r itself the most bellicose of the tribes of Israel.\r \r      * The history of this migration, which is given summarily in\r      Josh. xix. 47, is, as it now stands, a blending of two\r      accounts. The presence of a descendant of Moses as a priest\r      in this local sanctuary probably offended the religious\r      scruples of a copyist, who substituted Manasseh for Moses\r      (Judges xviii. 30), but the correction was not generally\r      accepted. [The R.V. reads Moses where the authorised text\r      has Manasseh.--Tr.]\r \r It bore out well its character--Dan is a lions whelp that leapeth\r forth from Bashan on the Hermon;* a serpent in the way, an adder\r in the path, that biteth the horses heels, so that his rider falleth\r backward. ** The new position they had taken up enabled them to protect\r Galilee for centuries against the incursions of the Aramaeans.\r \r      * See the Blessing of Moses (Dent, xxxiii. 22).\r \r      ** These are the words used in the Blessing of Jacob (Gen.\r      xlix. 17).\r \r [Illustration: 304.jpg THE HILL OF SHILOH, SEEN FROM THE NORTH-EAST]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from photograph No. 100 of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund._\r \r Their departure, however, left the descendants of Joseph unprotected,\r with Benjamin as their only bulwark. Benjamin, like Dan, was one of\r the tribes which contained scarcely more than two or three clans, but\r compensated for the smallness of their numbers by their energy and\r tenacity of character: lying to the south of Ephraim, they had developed\r into a breed of hardy adventurers, skilled in handling the bow and\r sling, accustomed from childhood to use both hands indifferently,\r and always ready to set out on any expedition, not only against the\r Canaanites, but, if need be, against their own kinsfolk.* They had\r consequently aroused the hatred of both friend and foe, and we read that\r the remaining tribes at length decreed their destruction; a massacre\r ensued, from which six hundred Benjamites only escaped to continue the\r race.** Their territory adjoined on the south that of Jerusalem, the\r fortress of the Jebusites, and on the west the powerful confederation of\r which Gibeon was the head. It comprised some half-dozen towns--Ramah,\r Anathoth, Michmash, and Nob, and thus commanded both sides of the passes\r leading from the Shephelah into the valley of the Jordan. The Benjamites\r were in the habit of descending suddenly upon merchants who were making\r their way to or returning from Gilead, and of robbing them of their\r wares; sometimes they would make a raid upon the environs of Ekron and\r Gath, like a wolf that ravineth: realising the prediction of Jacob,\r in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at even he shall divide\r the spoil. ***\r \r      * Benjamin signifies, properly speaking, the Southern.\r \r      ** Story of the Lévite of Ephraim (Judges xix.-xxi.). The\r      groundwork of it contains only one historical element. The\r      story of the Lévite is considered by some critics to be of a\r      later date than the rest of the text.\r \r      *** He is thus characterised in the Blessing of Jacob (Gen.\r      xlix. 27). VOL. VI.  X\r \r The Philistines never failed to make reprisals after each raid, and the\r Benjamites were no match for their heavily armed battalions; but the\r labyrinth of ravines and narrow gorges into which the Philistines had\r to penetrate to meet their enemy was a favourable region for guerilla\r warfare, in which they were no match for their opponents. Peace was\r never of long duration on this ill-defined borderland, and neither\r intercourse between one village and another, alliances, nor\r intermarriage between the two peoples had the effect of interrupting\r hostilities; even when a truce was made at one locality, the feud would\r be kept up at other points of contact. All details of this conflict have\r been lost, and we merely know that it terminated in the defeat of the\r house of Joseph, a number of whom were enslaved. The ancient sanctuary\r of Shiloh still continued to be the sacred town of the Hebrews, as it\r had been under the Canaanites, and the people of Ephraim kept there the\r ark of Jahveh-Sabaoth, the Lord of Hosts. * It was a chest of wood,\r similar in shape to the shrine which surmounted the sacred barks of the\r Egyptian divinities, but instead of a prophesying statue, it contained\r two stones on which, according to the belief of a later age, the law had\r been engraved.** Yearly festivals were celebrated before it, and it was\r consulted as an oracle by all the Israelites. Eli, the priest to whose\r care it was at this time consigned, had earned universal respect by\r the austerity of his life and by his skill in interpreting the divine\r oracles.***\r \r      * At the very opening of the _First Book of Samuel_ (i. 3),\r      Shiloh is mentioned as being the sanctuary of _Jahveh-\r      Sabaoth_, Jahveh the Lord of hosts. The tradition preserved\r      in Josh, xviii. 1, removes the date of its establishment as\r      far back as the earliest times of the Israelite conquest.\r \r      ** The idea that the Tables of the Law were enclosed in the\r      Ark is frequently expressed in Exodus and in subsequent\r      books of the Hexateuch.\r \r      *** The history of Eli extends over chaps, i.-iv. of the\r      _First Book of Samuel_; it is incorporated with that of\r      Samuel, and treats only of the events which accompanied the\r      destruction of the sanctuary of Shiloh by the Philistines.\r \r His two sons, on the contrary, took advantage of his extreme age to\r annoy those who came up to worship, and they were even accused of\r improper behaviour towards the women who served at the door of the\r tabernacle. They appropriated to themselves a larger portion of the\r victims than they were entitled to, extracting from the caldron the\r meat offerings of the faithful after the sacrifice was over by means of\r flesh-hooks. Their misdeeds were such, that men abhorred the offering\r of the Lord, and yet the reverence for the ark was so great in the\r minds of the people, that they continued to have recourse to it on every\r occasion of national danger.* The people of Ephraim and Benjamin having\r been defeated once between Eben-ezer and Aphek, bore the ark in state to\r the battle-field, that its presence might inspire them with confidence.\r The Philistines were alarmed at its advent, and exclaimed, God is come\r into the camp. Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of\r these mighty gods?... Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye\r Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been\r to you. ** In response to this appeal, their troops fought so boldly\r that they once more gained a victory. And there ran a man of Benjamin\r out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent,\r and with earth upon his head. And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his\r seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God.\r And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried\r out. And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth\r the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli. Now\r Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could\r not see. And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army,\r and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my\r son? And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled\r before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among\r the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phineas, are dead, and the\r ark of God is taken. And it came to pass, when he made mention of the\r ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of\r the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and\r heavy. ***\r \r      * Sam. iv. 12-18.\r \r      ** This is not mentioned in the sacred books; but certain\r      reasons for believing this destruction to have taken place\r      are given by Stade.\r \r      *** The Philistine garrison at Geba (Gibeah) is mentioned in\r      1 Sam. xiii. 3, i.\r \r The defeat of Eben-ezer completed, at least for a time, the overthrow of\r the tribes of Central Canaan. The Philistines destroyed the sanctuary\r of Shiloh, and placed a garrison at Gibeah to keep the Benjamites in\r subjection, and to command the route of the Jordan;* it would even\r appear that they pushed their advance-posts beyond Carmel in order to\r keep in touch with the independent Canaanite cities such as Megiddo,\r Taanach, and Bethshan, and to ensure a free use of the various routes\r leading in the direction of Damascus, Tyre, and Coele-Syria.**\r \r      * After the victory at Gilboa, the Philistines exposed the\r      dead bodies of Saul and his sons upon the walls of Bethshan\r      (1 Sam. xxxi. 10, 12), which they would not have been able\r      to do had the inhabitants not been allies or vassals.\r      Friendly relations with Bethshan entailed almost as a matter\r      of course some similar understanding with the cities of the\r      plain of Jezreel.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. vii. 16, 17. These verses represent, as a matter\r      of fact, all that we know of Samuel anterior to his\r      relations with Saul. This account seems to represent him as\r      exercising merely a restricted influence over the territory\r      of Benjamin and the south of Ephraim. It was not until the\r      prophetic period that, together with Eli, he was made to\r      figure as Judge of all Israel.\r \r The Philistine power continued dominant for at least half a century. The\r Hebrew chroniclers, scandalised at the prosperity of the heathen,\r did their best to abridge the time of the Philistine dominion, and\r interspersed it with Israelitish victories. Just at this time, however,\r there lived a man who was able to inspire them with fresh hope. He was\r a priest of Bamah, Samuel, the son of Elkanah, who had acquired the\r reputation of being a just and wise judge in the towns of Bethel,\r Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places, and his\r return was to Bamah, for there was his house... and he built there an\r altar unto the Lord. To this man the whole Israelite nation attributed\r with pride the deliverance of their race. The sacred writings relate how\r his mother, the pious Hannah, had obtained his birth from Jahveh after\r years of childlessness, and had forthwith devoted him to the service of\r God. She had sent him to Shiloh at the age of three years, and there,\r clothed in a linen tunic and in a little robe which his mother made for\r him herself, he ministered before God in the presence of Eli. One night\r it happened, when the latter was asleep in his place, and the lamp\r of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the\r temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, that the Lord called\r Samuel: and he said, Here am I. And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here\r am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called thee not; lie down\r again. Twice again the voice was heard, and at length Eli perceived\r that it was God who had called the child, and he bade him reply: Speak,\r Lord; for Thy servant heareth. From thenceforward Jahveh was with him,\r and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from\r Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet\r of the Lord. Twenty years after the sad death of his master, Samuel\r felt that the moment had come to throw off the Philistine yoke; he\r exhorted the people to put away their false gods, and he assembled them\r at Mizpah to absolve them from their sins. The Philistines, suspicious\r of this concourse, which boded ill for the maintenance of their\r authority, arose against him. And when the children of Israel heard it,\r they were afraid of the Philistines. And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and\r offered it for a whole burnt offering unto the Lord: and Samuel cried\r unto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord answered him. The Philistines,\r demoralised by the thunderstorm which ensued, were overcome on the very\r spot where they had triumphed over the sons of Eli, and fled in disorder\r to their own country. Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between\r Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer (the Stone of\r Help), saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us. He next attacked the\r Tyrians and the Amorites, and won back from them all the territory they\r had conquered.* One passage, in which Samuel is not mentioned, tells\r us how heavily the Philistine yoke had weighed upon the people, and\r explains their long patience by the fact that their enemies had taken\r away all their weapons. Now there was no smith found throughout all\r the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them\r swords or spears; and whoever needed to buy or repair the most ordinary\r agricultural implements was forced to address himself to the Philistine\r blacksmiths.** The very extremity of the evil worked its own cure. The\r fear of the Midian-ites had already been the occasion of the ephemeral\r rule of Jerubbaal and Abimelech; the Philistine tyranny forced first the\r tribes of Central and then those of Southern Canaan to unite under the\r leadership of one man. In face of so redoubtable an enemy and so grave a\r peril a greater effort was required, and the result was proportionate to\r their increased activity.\r \r      * This manner of retaliating against the Philistines for the\r      disaster they had formerly inflicted on Israel, is supposed\r      by some critics to be an addition of a later date, either\r      belonging to the time of the prophets, or to the period when\r      the Jews, without any king or settled government, rallied at\r      Mizpah. According to these scholars, 1 Sam. vii. 2-14 forms\r      part of a biography, written at a time when the foundation\r      of the Benjamite monarchy had not as yet been attributed to\r      Saul.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. xiii. 20, 21.\r \r The Manassite rule extended at most over two or three clans, but that\r of Saul and David embraced the Israelite nation.* Benjamin at that\r time reckoned among its most powerful chiefs a man of ancient and\r noble family--Saul, the son of Kish--who possessed extensive flocks and\r considerable property, and was noted for his personal beauty, for there\r was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from\r his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. ** He had\r already reached mature manhood, and had several children, the eldest\r of whom, Jonathan, was well known as a skilful and brave soldier, while\r Sauls reputation was such that his kinsmen beyond Jordan had recourse\r to his aid as to a hero whose presence would secure victory. The\r Ammonites had laid siege to Jabesh-Gilead, and the town was on the point\r of surrendering; Saul came to their help, forced the enemy to raise the\r siege, and inflicted such a severe lesson upon them, that during the\r whole of his lifetime they did not again attempt hostilities. He was\r soon after proclaimed king by the Benjamites, as Jerubbaal had been\r raised to authority by the Manassites on the morrow of his victory.***\r \r      * The beginning of Sauls reign, up to his meeting with\r      David, will be found in 1 Sam. viii.-xv. We can distinguish\r      the remains of at least two ancient narratives, which the\r      writer of the Book of Samuel has put together in order to\r      form a complete and continuous account. As elsewhere in this\r      work, I have confined myself to accepting the results at\r      which criticism has arrived, without entering into detailed\r      discussions which do not come within the domain of history.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. ix. 2. In one account he is represented as quite a\r      young man, whose father is still in the prime of life (1\r      Sam. ix.), but this cannot refer to the time of the\r      Philistine war, where we find him accompanied, at the very\r      outset of his reign, by his son, who is already skilled in\r      the use of weapons.\r \r      *** 1 Sam. xi. According to the text of the Septuagint, the\r      war against the Ammonites broke out a month after Saul had\r      been secretly anointed by Samuel; his popular proclamation\r      did not take place till after the return from the campaign.\r \r We learn from the sacred writings that Samuels influence had helped to\r bring about these events. It had been shown him by the divine voice that\r Saul was to be the chosen ruler, and he had anointed him and set him\r before the people as their appointed lord; the scene of this must have\r been either Mizpah or Gilgal.*\r \r      * One narrative appears to represent him as being only the\r      priest or local prophet of Hamah, and depicts him as\r      favourable to the establishment of the monarchy (1 Sam. ix.\r      1-27, x. 1-16); the other, however, admits that he was\r      judge of all Israel, and implies that he was hostile to the\r      choice of a king (1 Sam. viii. 1-22, x. 17, 27, xii. 1-25)\r \r The accession of a sovereign who possessed the allegiance of all Israel\r could not fail to arouse the vigilance of their Philistine oppressors;\r Jonathan, however, anticipated their attack and captured Gibeah. The\r five kings at once despatched an army to revenge this loss; the main\r body occupied Michmash, almost opposite to the stronghold taken from\r them, while three bands of soldiers were dispersed over the country,\r ravaging as they went, with orders to attack Saul in the rear. The\r latter had only six hundred men, with whom he scarcely dared to face\r so large a force; besides which, he was separated from the enemy by the\r Wady Suweinît, here narrowed almost into a gorge between two precipitous\r rocks, and through which no body of troops could penetrate without\r running the risk of exposing themselves in single file to the enemy.\r Jonathan, however, resolved to attempt a surprise in broad daylight,\r accompanied only by his armour-bearer. There was a rocky crag on the\r one side, and a rooky crag on the other side: and the name of the one\r was Bozez (the Shining), and the name of the other Seneh (the Acacia).\r The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on\r the south in front of Geba (Gribeah). The two descended the side of the\r gorge, on the top of which they were encamped, and prepared openly to\r climb the opposite side. The Philistine sentries imagined they were\r deserters, and said as they approached: Behold, the Hebrews come forth\r out of the holes where they had hid themselves. And the men of the\r garrison answered Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and said, Come up\r to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his\r armour-bearer, Come up after me: for the Lord hath delivered them into\r the hand of Israel. And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his\r feet, and his armour-bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan;\r and his armour-bearer slew them after him. And that first slaughter that\r Jonathan and his armour-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as\r it were half a furrows length in an acre of land. From Gribeah, where\r Sauls troops were in ignorance of what was passing, the Benjamite\r sentinels could distinguish a tumult. Saul guessed that a surprise had\r taken place, and marched upon the enemy.\r \r [Illustration: 314.jpg THE WADY SUWEINIT]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from photograph No. 402 of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund_.\r \r The Philistines were ousted from their position, and pursued hotly\r beyond Bethel as far as Ajalon.* This constituted the actual birthday of\r the Israelite monarchy.\r \r      * The account of these events, separated by the parts\r      relating to the biography of Samuel (1 Sam. xiii. 76-15a,\r      thought by some to be of a later date), and of the breaking\r      by Jonathan of the fast enjoined by Saul (1 Sam. xiv. 23-\r      45), covers 1 Sam. xiii. 3-7a, 156-23, xiv. 1-22, 46. The\r      details appear to be strictly historical; the number of the\r      Philistines, however, seems to be exaggerated; 30,000\r      chariots, and 6000 horsemen, and people as the sand which is\r      on the sea-shore in multitude (1 Sam. xiii. 5).\r \r Gilead, the whole house of Joseph--Ephraim and Manasseh--and Benjamin\r formed its nucleus, and were Sauls strongest supporters. We do not know\r how far his influence extended northwards; it probably stopped short at\r the neighbourhood of Mount Tabor, and the Galileans either refused to\r submit to his authority, or acknowledged it merely in theory. In the\r south the clans of Judah and Simeon were not long in rallying round\r him, and their neighbours the Kenites, with Caleb and Jerahmeel, soon\r followed their example. These southerners, however, appear to have been\r somewhat half-hearted in their allegiance to the Benjamite king: it was\r not enough to have gained their adhesion--a stronger tie was needed to\r attach them to the rest of the nation. Saul endeavoured to get rid of\r the line of Canaanite cities which isolated them from Ephraim, but\r he failed in the effort, we know not from what cause, and his attempt\r produced no other result than to arouse against him the hatred of the\r Gibeonite inhabitants.* He did his best to watch over the security of\r his new subjects, and protected them against the Amalekites, who were\r constantly harassing them.\r \r      * The fact is made known to us by an accidental mention of\r      it in 2 Sam. xxi. 1-11. The motive which induced Saul to\r      take arms against the Gibeonites is immediately apparent\r      when we realise the position occupied by Gideon between\r      Judah and the tribes of Central Canaan.\r \r Their king, Agag, happening to fall into his hands, he killed him, and\r destroyed several of their nomad bands, thus inspiring the remainder\r with a salutary terror.* Subsequent tradition credited him with\r victories gained over all the enemies of Israel--over Moab, Edom, and\r even the Aramaeans of Zobah--it endowed him even with the projects\r and conquests of David. At any rate, the constant incursions of the\r Philistines could not have left him much time for fighting in the\r north and east of his domains. Their defeat at Gibeah was by no means\r a decisive one, and they quickly recovered from the blow; the conflict\r with them lasted to the end of Sauls lifetime, and during the whole of\r this period he never lost an opportunity of increasing his army.**\r \r The monarchy was as yet in a very rudimentary state, without either\r the pomp or accessories usually associated with royalty in the ancient\r kingdoms of the East. Saul, as King of Israel, led much the same sort of\r life as when he was merely a Benjamite chief. He preferred to reside at\r Gibeah, in the house of his forefathers, with no further resources than\r those yielded by the domain inherited from his ancestors, together with\r the spoil taken in battle.***\r \r      * The part taken by Samuel in the narrative of Sauls war\r      against the Amalekites (1 Sam. xv.) is thought by some\r      critics to have been introduced with a view of exalting the\r      prophets office at the expense of the king and the\r      monarchy. They regard 1 Sam. xiv. 48 as being the sole\r      historic ground of the narrative.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. xiv. 47. We may admit his successful skirmishes\r      with Moab, but some writers maintain that the defeat of the\r      Edomites and Aramaeans is a mere anticipation, and consider\r      that the passage is only a reflection of 2 Sam. viii. 8, and\r      reproduces the list of the wars of David, with the exception\r      of the expedition against Damascus.\r \r      *** Gibeah is nowhere expressly mentioned as being the\r      capital of Saul, but the name Gibeah of Saul which it bore\r      shows that it must have been the royal residence; the names\r      of the towns mentioned in the account of Sauls pursuit of\r      David--Naioth, Eamah, and Nob--are all near to Gibeah. It\r      was also at Gibeah that the Gibeonites slew seven of the\r      sons and grandsons of Saul (2 Sam. xxi. 6-9), no doubt to\r      bring ignominy on the family of the first king in the very\r      place in which they had governed.\r \r All that he had, in addition to his former surroundings, were a\r priesthood attached to the court, and a small army entirely at his own\r disposal. Ahijah, a descendant of Eli, sacrificed for the king when the\r latter did not himself officiate; he fulfilled the office of chaplain\r to him in time of war, and was the mouthpiece of the divine oracles\r when these were consulted as to the propitious moment for attacking the\r enemy.\r \r [Illustration: 319.jpg A PHOENICIAN SOLDIER]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the bronze original in the\r      Louvre.\r \r The army consisted of a nucleus of Benjamites, recruited from the\r kings clan, with the addition of any adventurers, whether Israelites or\r strangers, who were attracted to enlist under a popular military chief.*\r It comprised archers, slingers, and bands of heavily armed infantry,\r after the fashion of the Phoenician, bearing pikes. We can gam some\r idea of their appearance and equipment from the bronze statuettes of an\r almost contemporary period, which show us the Phoenician foot-soldiers\r or the barbarian mercenaries in the pay of the Phoenician cities: they\r wear the horizontally striped loin-cloth of the Syrians, leaving the\r arms and legs entirely bare, and the head is protected by a pointed or\r conical helmet.\r \r      * Ahijah (1 Sam. xiv. 3), son of Ahitub, great-grandson of\r      Eli, appears to be the same as Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, who\r      subsequently helped David (1 Sam. xxi. 1-10), and was\r      massacred by order of Saul (1 Sam. xxii. 9-19). The scribe\r      must have been shocked by the name Melech--that of the god\r      Milik [Moloch]--and must have substituted Jah or Jahveh.\r \r Saul possessed none of the iron-bound chariots which always accompanied\r the Qanaanite infantry; these heavy vehicles would have been entirely\r out of place in the mountain districts, which were the usual field of\r operations for the Israelite force.* We are unable to ascertain whether\r the kings soldiers received any regular pay, but we know that the spoil\r was divided between the prince and his men, each according to his\r rank and in proportion to the valour he had displayed.** In cases of\r necessity, the whole of the tribes were assembled, and a selection was\r made of all those capable of bearing arms. This militia, composed mainly\r of a pastoral peasantry in the prime of life, capable of heroic efforts,\r was nevertheless ill-disciplined, liable to sudden panics, and prone to\r become disbanded on the slightest reverse.***\r \r      * With regard to the use of the bow among Sauls soldiers,\r      cf. 1 Sam. xx. 18-42, where we find the curious scene of the\r      meeting of David and Jonathan, when the latter came out of\r      Gibeah on the pretext of practising with bow and arrows. The\r      accoutrement of the Hebrews is given in the passage where\r      Saul lends his armour to David before meeting with Goliath\r      (1 Sam. xvii. 38, 39).\r \r      ** Cf. the quarrel which took place between the soldiers of\r      David about the spoil taken from the Amalekites, and the\r      manner in which the strife was decided by David (1 Sam. xxx.\r      21-25)\r \r      *** Saul, for instance, assembles the people and makes a\r      selection to attack the Philistines (1 Sam. xiii. 2, 4, 7)\r      against the Ammonites (1 Sam. xi. 7, 8) and against the\r      Amalekites (1 Sam. xv. 4).\r \r Saul had the supreme command of the whole; the members of his own family\r served as lieutenants under him, including his son Jonathan, to whom\r he owed some of his most brilliant victories, together with his cousin\r Abner, the _sar-zaba_, who led the royal guard.* Among the men of\r distinguished valour who had taken service under Saul, he soon singled\r out David, son of Jesse, a native of Bethlehem of Judah.** David was\r the first Judæan hero, the typical king who served as a model to all\r subsequent monarchs. His elevation, like that of Saul, is traced to\r Samuel. The old prophet had repaired to Bethlehem ostensibly to offer a\r sacrifice, and after examining all the children of Jesse, he chose the\r youngest, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the spirit\r of the Lord came mightily upon David. ***\r \r      * 1 Sam. xiv. 50, 51. There is no record of the part played\r      by Abner during Sauls lifetime: he begins to figure in the\r      narrative after the battle at Gilboa under the double reign\r      of Ish-bosheth and David.\r \r      ** The name of David is a shortened form of Davdo, Dodo,\r      the favourite of Him, i.e. God.\r \r      *** The intervention of the prophet occupies 1 Sam. xvi. 1-\r      13. Some critics have imagined that this passage was\r      interpolated at a later date, and reflects the events which\r      are narrated in chap. x. They say it was to show that Saul\r      was not alone in enjoying consecration by the prophet, and\r      hence all doubt would be set at rest as to whether David was\r      actually that neighbour of thine, that is better than\r      thou, mentioned in 1 Sam. xv. 28.\r \r His introduction at the court of Saul is variously accounted for.\r According to one narrative, Saul, being possessed by an evil spirit,\r fell at times into a profound melancholy, from which he could be aroused\r only by the playing of a harp. On learning that David was skilled in\r this instrument, he begged Jesse to send him his son, and the lad soon\r won the kings affection. As often as the illness came upon him, David\r took his harp, and Saul was refreshed, and the evil spirit departed\r from him. * Another account relates that he entered on his soldierly\r career by killing with his sling Goliath of Gath,** who had challenged\r the bravest Israelites to combat; though elsewhere the death of Goliath\r is attributed to Elhanan of Bethlehem,*** one of the mighty men of\r valour, who specially distinguished himself in the wars against the\r Philistines. David had, however, no need to take to himself the brave\r deeds of others; at Ephes-dammîm, in company with Eleazar, the son of\r Dodai, and Shammah, the son of Agu, he had posted himself in a field\r of lentils, and the three warriors had kept the Philistines at bay till\r their discomfited Israelite comrades had had time to rally.****\r \r      * 1 Sam. xvi. 14-23. This narrative is directly connected\r      with 1 Sam. xiv. 52, where we are told that when Saul saw\r      any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. xvii., xviii. 1-5. According to some writers, this\r      second version, the best known of the two, is a development\r      at a later period of the tradition preserved in 2 Sam. xxi.\r      19, where the victory of Elhanan over Goliath is recorded.\r \r      *** 2 Sam. xxi. 19, where the duel of Goliath and Elhanan is\r      placed in the reign of David, during the combat at Gob. Some\r      critics think that the writer of Chronicles, recognising the\r      difficulty presented by this passage, changed the epithet\r      Bethlehemite, which qualified the name of Elhanan, into\r      Lahmi, the name of Goliaths brother (1 Citron, xx. 5). Say\r      ce thought to get over the difficulty by supposing that\r      Elhanan was Davids first name; but Elhanan is the son of\r      Jair, and not the son of Jesse.\r \r      **** The combat of Paz-Dammîm or Ephes-Dammîm is mentioned\r      in 1 Sam. xvii. 1; the exploit of David and his two\r      comrades, 2 Sam: xxiii. 9-12 (cf. 1 Chron. xi, 12-14, which\r      slightly varies from 2 Sam. xxiii. 9-12).\r \r Saul entrusted him with several difficult undertakings, in all of which\r he acquitted himself with honour. On his return from one of them, the\r women of the villages came out to meet him, singing and dancing to the\r sound of timbrels, the refrain of their song being: Saul hath slain his\r thousands, and David his ten thousands. The king concealed the jealousy\r which this simple expression of joy excited within him, but it found\r vent at the next outbreak of his illness, and he attempted to kill David\r with a spear, though soon after he endeavoured to make amends for his\r action by giving him his second daughter Michal in marriage.* This did\r not prevent the king from again attempting Davids life, either in\r a real or simulated fit of madness; but not being successful, he\r despatched a body of men to waylay him. According to one account it was\r Michal who helped her husband to escape,** while another attributes the\r saving of his life to Jonathan. This prince had already brought about\r one reconciliation between his father and David, and had spared no pains\r to reinstall him in the royal favour, but his efforts merely aroused\r the kings suspicion against himself. Saul imagined that a conspiracy\r existed for the purpose of dethroning him, and of replacing him by his\r son; Jonathan, knowing that his life also was threatened, at length\r renounced the attempt, and David and his followers withdrew from court.\r \r      * The account of the first disagreement between Saul and\r      David, and with regard to the marriage of David with Michal,\r      is given in 1 Sam. xviii. 6-16, 20-29, and presents every\r      appearance of authenticity. Verses 17-19, mentioning a\r      project of union between David and Sauls eldest daughter,\r      Merab, has at some time been interpolated; it is not given\r      in the LXX., either because it was not in the Hebrew version\r      they had before them, or because they suppressed it owing to\r      the motive appearing to them insufficient.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. xix. 11-17. Many critics regard this passage as an\r      interpolation.\r \r [Illustration: 324.jpg AÎD-EL-RA, THE SITE OF THE ANCIENT ADULLAM]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from photograph No. 430 of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund._\r \r He was hospitably received by a descendant of Eli,* Ahimelech the\r priest, at Nob, and wandered about in the neighbourhood of Adullam,\r hiding himself in the wooded valleys of Khereth, in the heart of Judah.\r He retained the sympathies of many of the Benjamites, more than one\r of whom doubted whether it would not be to their advantage to transfer\r their allegiance from their aged king to this more youthful hero.\r \r      * 1 Sam. xxi. 8, 9 adds that he took as a weapon the sword\r      of Goliath which was laid up in the sanctuary at Nob.\r \r Saul got news of their defection, and one day when he was sitting, spear\r in hand, under the tamarisk at Gibeah, he indignantly upbraided his\r servants, and pointed out to them the folly of their plans. Hear, now,\r ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and\r vineyards? will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of\r hundreds? Ahimelech was selected as the victim of the kings anger:\r denounced by Doeg, Sauls steward, he was put to death, and all his\r family, with the exception of Abiathar, one of his sons, perished with\r him.* As soon as it became known that David held the hill-country,\r a crowd of adventurous spirits flocked to place themselves under his\r leadership, anticipating, no doubt, that spoil would not be lacking with\r so brave a chief, and he soon found himself at the head of a small\r army, with Abiathar as priest, and the ephod, rescued from Nob, in his\r possession.**\r \r      * 1 Sam. xix.-xxii., where, according to some critics, two\r      contradictory versions have been blended together at a late\r      period. The most probable version is given in 1 Sam, xix. 8-\r      10 [11-18a], xxi. 1-7 [8-10], xxii., and is that which I\r      have followed by preference; the other version, according to\r      these writers, attributes too important a rôle to Jonathan,\r      and relates at length the efforts he made to reconcile his\r      father and his friend (1 Sam. xviii. 30, xix. 1-7, xx.). It\r      is thought, from the confusion apparent in this part of the\r      narrative, that a record of the real motives which provoked\r      a rupture between the king and his son-in-law has not been\r      preserved.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. xxii. 20-23, xxiii. 6. For the use of the ephod by\r      Abiathar for oracular purposes, cf. 1 Sam. xxiii. 9-12, xxx.\r      7, 8; the inquiry in 1 Sam. xxiii. 2-4 probably belongs to\r      the same series, although neither Abiathar nor the ephod is\r      mentioned.\r \r The country was favourable for their operations; it was a perfect\r labyrinth of deep ravines, communicating with each other by narrow\r passes or by paths winding along the edges of precipices. Isolated\r rocks, accessible only by rugged ascents, defied assault, while\r extensive caves offered a safe hiding-place to those who were familiar\r with their windings. One day the little band descended to the rescue of\r Keilah, which they succeeded in wresting from the Philistines, but no\r sooner did they learn that Saul was on his way to meet them than they\r took refuge in the south of Judah, in the neighbourhood of Ziph and\r Maôn, between the mountains and the Dead Sea.*\r \r      * 1 Sam. xxiii. 1-13; an episode acknowledged to be\r      historical by nearly-all modern critics.\r \r [Illustration: 326.jpg THE DESERT OF JUDAH]\r \r      Drawn by Boudior, from photograph No. 197 of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund._ The heights visible in the distance are\r      the mountains of Moab, beyond the Dead Sea.\r \r Saul already irritated by his rivals successes, was still more galled\r by being always on the point of capturing him, and yet always seeing him\r slip from his grasp. On one afternoon, when the king had retired into a\r cave for his siesta, he found himself at the mercy of his adversary; the\r latter, however, respected the sleep of his royal master, and contented\r himself with cutting a piece off his mantle.* On another occasion David,\r in company with Abishai and Ahimelech the Hittite, took a lance and\r a pitcher of water from the kings bedside.** The inhabitants of the\r country were not all equally loyal to Davids cause; those of Ziph,\r whose meagre resources were taxed to support his followers, plotted to\r deliver him up to the king,*** while Nabal of Maôn roughly refused\r him food. Abigail atoned for her husbands churlishness by a speedy\r submission; she collected a supply of provisions, and brought it herself\r to the wanderers. David was as much disarmed by her tact as by her\r beauty, and when she was left a widow he married her. This union insured\r the support of the Calebite clan, the most powerful in that part of\r the country, and policy as well as gratitude no doubt suggested the\r alliance.\r \r      * 1 Sam, xxiv. Thought by some writers to be of much later\r      date.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. xxvi. 4-25.\r \r Skirmishes were not as frequent between the kings troops and the\r outlaws as we might at first be inclined to believe, but if at times\r there was a truce to hostilities, they never actually ceased, and\r the position became intolerable. Encamped between his kinsman and the\r Philistines, David found himself unable to resist either party except by\r making friends with the other. An incursion of the Philistines near Maôn\r saved David from the king, but when Saul had repulsed it, David had no\r choice but to throw himself into the arms of Achish, King of Gath,\r of whom he craved permission to settle as his vassal at Ziklag, on\r condition of Davids defending the frontier against the Bedawin.*\r \r \r * 1 Sam. xxvii. The earlier part of this chapter (vers. 1-6) is strictly\r historical. Some critics take vers. 8-12 to be of later date, and\r pretend that they were inserted to show the cleverness of David, and to\r deride the credulity of the King of Gath.\r \r Saul did not deem it advisable to try and dislodge him from this\r retreat. Peace having been re-established in Judah, the king turned\r northward and occupied the heights which bound the plain of Jezreel to\r the east; it is possible that he contemplated pushing further afield,\r and rallying round him those northern tribes who had hitherto never\r acknowledged his authority. He may, on the other hand, have desired\r merely to lay hands on the Syrian highways, and divert to his own\r profit the resources brought by the caravans which plied along them.\r The Philistines, who had been nearly ruined by the loss of the right to\r demand toll of these merchants, assembled the contingents of their five\r principalities, among them being the Hebrews of David, who formed\r the personal guard of Achish. The four other princes objected to the\r presence of these strangers in their midst, and forced Achish to dismiss\r them. David returned to Ziklag, to find ruin and desolation everywhere.\r The Amalekites had taken advantage of the departure of the Hebrews to\r revenge themselves once for all for Davids former raids on them, and\r they had burnt the town, carrying off the women and flocks. David at\r once set out on their track, overtook them just beyond the torrent of\r Besor, and rescued from them, not only his own belongings, but all the\r booty they had collected by the way in the southern provinces of Caleb,\r in Judah, and in the Cherethite plain.\r \r He distributed part of this spoil among those cities of Judah which\r had shown hospitality to himself and his men, for instance, to Jattir,\r Aroer, Eshtemoa, Hormah, and Hebron.* While he thus kept up friendly\r relations with those who might otherwise have been tempted to forget\r him, Saul was making his last supreme effort against the Philistines,\r but only ito meet with failure. He had been successful in repulsing them\r as long as he kept to the mountain districts, where the courage of his\r troops made up for their lack of numbers and the inferiority of their\r arms; but he was imprudent enough to take up a position on the hillsides\r of Gilboa, whose gentle slopes offered no hindrances to the operations\r of the heavy Philistine battalions. They attacked the Israelites from\r the Shunem side, and swept all before them. Jonathan perished in the\r conflict, together with his two brothers, Malchi-shua and Abinadab;\r Saul, who was wounded by an arrow, begged his armour-bearer to take his\r life, but, on his persistently refusing, the king killed himself with\r his own sword. The victorious Philistines cut off his head and those of\r his sons, and placed their armour in the temple of Ashtoreth,**\r while their bodies, thus despoiled, were hung up outside the walls of\r Bethshan, whose Canaanite inhabitants had made common cause with the\r Philistines against Israel.\r \r      * 1 Sam. xxviii. 1, 2, xxix., xxx. The torrent of Besor is\r      the present Wady Esh-Sheriah, which runs to the south of\r      Gaza.\r \r      ** The text of 1 Sam. xxxi. 10 says, in a vague manner, in\r      the house of the Ashtaroth (in the plural), which is\r      corrected, somewhat arbitrarily, in 1 Chron. x. 10 iato in\r      the house of Dagon (B.V.); it is possible that it was the\r      temple at Gaza, Gaza being the chief of the Philistine\r      towns.\r \r The people of Jabesh-Gilead, who had never forgotten how Saul had saved\r them from the Ammonites, hearing the news, marched all night, rescued\r the mutilated remains, and brought them back to their own town, where\r they burned them, and buried the charred bones under a tamarisk, fasting\r meanwhile seven days as a sign of mourning.*\r \r      * 1 Sam. xxxi. It would seem that there were two narratives\r      describing this war: in one, the Philistines encamped at\r      Shunem, and Saul occupied Mount Gilboa (1 Sam. xxviii. 4);\r      in the other, the Philistines encamped at Aphek, and the\r      Israelites by the fountain which is in Jezreel (1 Sam.\r      xxix. 1). The first of these accounts is connected with the\r      episode of the witch of Endor, the second with the sending\r      away of David by Achish. The final catastrophe is in both\r      narratives placed on Mount Gilboa and Stade has endeavoured\r      to reconcile the two accounts by admitting that the battle\r      was fought between Aphek and the fountain, but that the\r      final scene took place on the slopes of Gilboa. There are\r      even two versions of the battle, one in 1 Sam. xxxi. and the\r      other in 2 Sam. i. 6-10, where Saul does not kill himself,\r      but begs an Amalekite to slay him; many critics reject the\r      second version.\r \r [Illustration: 330.jpg THE HILL OF BETHSHAN, SEEN FROM THE EAST]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from photograph No. 79 of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund._\r \r David afterwards disinterred these relics, and laid them in the\r burying-place of the family of Kish at Zela, in Benjamin. The tragic end\r of their king made a profound impression on the people. We read that,\r before entering on his last battle, Saul was given over to gloomy\r forebodings: he had sought counsel of Jahveh, but God answered him not,\r neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. The aged Samuel had\r passed away at Ramah, and had apparently never seen the king after\r the flight of David;* Saul now bethought himself of the prophet in his\r despair, and sought to recall him from the tomb to obtain his counsel.\r \r      * 1 Sam. xxv. 1, repeated 1 Sam. xxviii. 3, with a mention\r      of the measures taken by Saul against the wizards and\r      fortune-tellers.\r \r The king had banished from the land all wizards and fortune-tellers, but\r his servants brought him word that at Endor there still remained a woman\r who could call up the dead. Saul disguised himself, and, accompanied by\r two of his retainers, went to find her; he succeeded in overcoming her\r fear of punishment, and persuaded her to make the evocation. Whom\r shall I bring up unto thee?--Bring up Samuel.--And when the woman saw\r Samuel, she cried with a loud voice, saying, Why hast thou deceived me,\r for thou art Saul? And the king said unto her, Be not afraid, for what\r sawest thou?--I saw gods ascending out of the earth.--What form is\r he of?--An old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle. Saul\r immediately recognised Samuel, and prostrated himself with his face to\r the ground before him. The prophet, as inflexible after death as in\r his lifetime, had no words of comfort for the God-forsaken man who had\r troubled his repose. The Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand,\r and given it to thy neighbour, even to David, because thou obeyedst not\r the voice of the Lord,... and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with\r me. The Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hands of the\r Philistines. *\r \r      * 1 Sam. xxviii. 5-25. There is no reason why this scene\r      should not be historical; it was natural that Saul, like\r      many an ancient general in similar circumstances, should\r      seek to know the future by means of the occult sciences then\r      in vogue. Some critics think that certain details of the\r      evocation--as, for instance, the words attributed to Samuel\r      --are of a later date.\r \r We learn, also, how David, at Ziklag, on hearing the news of the\r disaster, had broken into weeping, and had composed a lament, full\r of beauty, known as the Song of the Bow, which the people of Judah\r committed to memory in their childhood. Thy glory, O Israel, is slain\r upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath,\r publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the\r Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph!\r Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither\r fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast\r away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil! From the blood of the\r slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back,\r the sword of Saul returned not empty. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and\r pleasant in their lives, and in death they were not divided. *\r \r      * 2 Sam. i. 17-27 (R.V.). This elegy is described as a\r      quotation from Jasher, the Book of the Upright. Many modern\r      writers attribute its authorship to David himself; others\r      reject this view; all agree in regarding it as extremely\r      ancient. The title, Song of the Bow, is based on the\r      possibly corrupt text of ver. 18.\r \r The Philistines occupied in force the plain of Jezreel and the pass\r which leads from it into the lowlands of Bethshan: the Israelites\r abandoned the villages which they had occupied in these districts, and\r the gap between the Hebrews of the north and those of the centre grew\r wider. The remnants of Sauls army sought shelter on the eastern bank\r of the Jordan, but found no leader to reorganise them. The reverse\r sustained by the Israelitish champion seemed, moreover, to prove the\r futility of trying to make a stand against the invader, and even the\r useless-ness of the monarchy itself: why, they might have asked, burthen\r ourselves with a master, and patiently bear with his exactions, if, when\r put to the test, he fails to discharge the duties for the performance\r of which he was chosen? And yet the advantages of a stable form of\r government had been so manifest during the reign of Saul, that it never\r for a moment occurred to his former subjects to revert to patriarchal\r institutions: the question which troubled them was not whether they were\r to have a king, but rather who was to fill the post. Saul had left a\r considerable number of descendants behind him.* From these, Abner, the\r ablest of his captains, chose Ishbaal, and set him on the throne to\r reign under his guidance.**\r \r      * We know that he had three sons by his wife Ahinoam--\r      Jonathan, Ishbaal, and Malchi-shua; and two daughters, Merab\r      and Michal (1 Sam. xiv. 49, 50, where Ishvi should be read\r      Ishbaal). Jonathan left at least one son, Meribbaal (1\r      Chron. viii. 34, ix. 40, called Mephibosheth in 2 Sam. xxi.\r      7), and Merab had five sons by Adriel (2 Sam. xxi. 8). One\r      of Sauls concubines, Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had borne\r      him two sons, Armoni and Meribbaal (2 Sam. xxi. 8, where the\r      name Meribbaal is changed into Mephibosheth); Abinadab, who\r      fell with him in the fight at Mount Gilboa (1 Sam. xxxi. 2),\r      whose mothers name is not mentioned, was another son.\r \r      ** Ishbaal was still a child when his father died: had he\r      been old enough to bear arms, he would have taken a part in\r      the battle of Gilboa with his brothers.. The expressions\r      used in the account of his elevation to the throne prove\r      that he was a minor (2 Sam. ii. 8, 9); the statement that he\r      was forty years old when he began to reign would seem,\r      therefore, to be an error (ii. 10).\r \r Gibeah was too close to the frontier to be a safe residence for a\r sovereign whose position was still insecure; Abner therefore installed\r Ishbaal at Mahanaim, in the heart of the country of Gilead. The house\r of Jacob, including the tribe of Benjamin, acknowledged him as king, but\r Judah held aloof. It had adopted the same policy at the beginning of\r the previous reign, yet its earlier isolation had not prevented it from\r afterwards throwing in its lot with the rest of the nation. But at that\r time no leader had come forward from its own ranks who was worthy to be\r reckoned among the mighty men of Israel; now, on the contrary, it had on\r its frontier a bold and resolute leader of its own race. David lost no\r time in stepping into the place of those whose loss he had bewailed.\r Their sudden removal, while it left him without a peer among his own\r people, exposed him to the suspicion and underground machinations of his\r foreign protectors; he therefore quitted them and withdrew to Hebron,\r where his fellow-countrymen hastened to proclaim him king.* From that\r time onwards the tendency of the Hebrew race was to drift apart into two\r distinct bodies; one of them, the house of Joseph, which called itself\r by the name of Israel, took up its position in the north, on the banks\r of the Jordan; the other, which is described as the house of Judah, in\r the south, between the Dead Sea and the Shephelah. Abner endeavoured to\r suppress the rival kingdom in its infancy: he brought Ishbaal to Gibeah\r and proposed to Joab, who was in command of Davids army, that the\r conflict should be decided by the somewhat novel expedient of pitting\r twelve of the house of Judah against an equal number of the house of\r Benjamin. The champions of Judah are said to have won the day, but the\r opposing forces did not abide by the result, and the struggle still\r continued.**\r \r      * 2 Sam. ii. 1--11. Very probably Abner recognised the\r      Philistine suzerainty as David had done, for the sake of\r      peace; at any rate, we find no mention in Holy Writ of a war\r      between Ishbaal and the Philistines.\r \r      ** 2 Sam. ii. 12-32, iii. 1.\r \r An intrigue in the harem furnished a solution of the difficulty. Saul\r had raised one of his wives of the second rank, named Eizpah, to the\r post of favourite. Abner became enamoured of her and took her. This was\r an insult to the royal house, and amounted to an act of open usurpation:\r the wives of a sovereign could not legally belong to any but his\r successor, and for any one to treat them as Abner had treated Rizpah,\r was equivalent to his declaring himself the equal, and in a sense the\r rival, of his master. Ishbaal keenly resented his ministers conduct,\r and openly insulted him. Abner made terms with David, won the northern\r tribes, including that of Benjamin, over to his side, and when what\r seemed a propitious moment had arrived, made his way to Hebron with\r an escort of twenty men. He was favourably received, and all kinds of\r promises were made him; but when he was about to depart again in\r order to complete the negotiations with the disaffected elders, Joab,\r returning from an expedition, led him aside into a gateway and slew him.\r David gave him solemn burial, and composed a lament on the occasion, of\r which four verses have come down to us: having thus paid tribute to\r the virtues of the deceased general, he lost no time in taking further\r precautions to secure his power. The unfortunate king Ishbaal, deserted\r by every one, was assassinated by two of his officers as he slept in the\r heat of the day, and his head was carried to Hebron: David again poured\r forth lamentations, and ordered the traitors to be killed. There was now\r no obstacle between him and the throne: the elders of the people met him\r at Hebron, poured oil upon his head, and anointed him king over all\r the provinces which had obeyed the rule of Saul in Gilead--Ephraim and\r Benjamin as well as Judah.*\r \r      * 2 Sam. v. 1-3; in 1 Ghron. xi. 1-3, xii. 23-40, we find\r      further details beyond those given in the Book of Samuel; it\r      seems probable, however, that the northern tribes may not\r      have recognised Davids sovereignty at this time.\r \r As long as Ishbaal lived, and his dissensions with Judah assured their\r supremacy, the Philistines were content to suspend hostilities: the news\r of his death, and of the union effected between Israel and Judah, soon\r roused them from this state of quiescence. As prince of the house of\r Caleb and vassal of the lord of Grath, David had not been an object of\r any serious apprehension to them; but in his new character, as master\r of the dominions of Saul, David became at once a dangerous rival, whom\r they must overthrow without delay, unless they were willing to risk\r being ere long overthrown by him. They therefore made an attack on\r Bethlehem with the choicest of their forces, and entrenched themselves\r there, with the Canaanite city of Jebus as their base, so as to separate\r Judah entirely from Benjamin, and cut off the little army quartered\r round Hebron from the reinforcements which the central tribes would\r otherwise have sent to its aid.* This move was carried out so quickly\r that David found himself practically isolated from the rest of his\r kingdom, and had no course left open but to shut himself up in Adullam,\r with his ordinary guard and the Judsean levies.**\r \r      * The history of this war is given in 2 Sam. v. 17-25, where\r      the text shows signs of having been much condensed. It is\r      preceded by the account of the capture of Jerusalem, which\r      some critics would like to transfer to chap, vi., following\r      ver. 1 which leads up to it. The events which followed are\r      self-explanatory, if we assume, as I have done in the text,\r      that the Philistines wished to detach Judah from Israel: at\r      first (2 Sam. v. 17-21) David endeavours to release himself\r      and effect a juncture with Israel, as is proved by the\r      relative positions assigned to the two opposing armies, the\r      Philistines at Bethlehem, David in the cave of Adullam;\r      afterwards (2 Sam. v. 22-25) David has shaken himself free,\r      has rejoined Israel, and is carrying on the struggle between\r      Gibeah and Gezer. The incidents recounted in 2 Sam. xxi. 15-\r      22, xxiii. 13-19, seem to refer almost exclusively to the\r      earlier part of the war, at the time when the Hebrews were\r      hemmed in in the neighbourhood of Adullam.\r \r      ** The passage in 2 Sam. v. 17 simply states that David\r      went down to the hold, and gives no further details. This\r      expression, following as it does the account of the taking\r      of Jerusalem, would seem to refer to this town itself, and\r      Renan has thus interpreted it. It really refers to Adullam,\r      as is shown by the passage in 2 Sam. xxiii. 13-17. 1 2 Sam.\r      xxi. 15-17.\r \r The whole district round about is intersected by a network of winding\r streams, and abounds in rocky gorges, where a few determined men could\r successfully hold their ground against the onset of a much more numerous\r body of troops. The caves afford, as we know, almost impregnable\r refuges: David had often hidden himself in them in the days when he fled\r before Saul, and now his soldiers profited by the knowledge he possessed\r of them to elude the attacks of the Philistines. He began a sort of\r guerilla warfare, in the conduct of which he seems to have been without\r a rival, and harassed in endless skirmishes his more heavily equipped\r adversaries. He did not spare himself, and freely risked his own life;\r but he was of small stature and not very powerful, so that his spirit\r often outran his strength. On one occasion, when he had advanced too far\r into the fray and was weary with striking, he ran great peril of being\r killed by a gigantic Philistine: with difficulty Abishai succeeded in\r rescuing him unharmed from the dangerous position into which he had\r ventured, and for the future he was not allowed to run such risks on the\r field of battle. On another occasion, when lying in the cave of Adullam,\r he began to feel a longing for the cool waters of Bethlehem, and asked\r who would go down and fetch him a draught from the well by the gates\r of the town. Three of his mighty men, Joshebbasshebeth, Eleazar, and\r Shammah, broke through the host of the Philistines and succeeded in\r bringing it; but he refused to drink the few drops they had brought,\r and poured them out as a libation to Jehovah, saying, Shall I drink the\r blood of men that went in jeopardy of their lives? * Duels between\r the bravest and stoutest champions of the two hosts were of frequent\r occurrence. It was in an encounter of this kind that Elhanan the\r Bethlehemite [or David] slew the giant Goliath at Gob. At length David\r succeeded in breaking his way through the enemies lines in the valley of\r Kephaîm, thus forcing open the road to the north. Here he probably fell\r in with the Israelitish contingent, and, thus reinforced, was at last\r in a position to give battle in the open: he was again successful,\r and, routing his foes, pursued them from Gibeon to Gezer.** None of his\r victories, however, was of a sufficiently decisive character to bring\r the struggle to an end: it dragged on year after year, and when at last\r it did terminate, there was no question on either side of submission or\r of tribute:*** the Hebrews completely regained their independence, but\r the Philistines do not seem to have lost any portion of their domain,\r and apparently retained possession of all that they had previously held.\r \r      * 2 Sam. xxiii. 13-17; cf. 1 Ghron. xi. 15-19. Popular\r      tradition furnishes many incidents of a similar type; cf.\r      Alexander in the desert of Gedrosia, Godfrey de Bouillon in\r      Asia Minor, etc.\r \r      ** The Hebrew text gives from Geba [or Gibeah] to Gezer\r       (2 Sam. v. 25); the Septuagint, from Gibeon to Gezer. This\r      latter reading [which is that of 1 Chron. xiv. 16.--Tr.] is\r      more in accordance with the geographical facts, and I have\r      therefore adopted it. Jahveh had shown by a continual\r      rustling in the leaves of the mulberry trees that He was on\r      Davids side.\r \r      *** In 2 Sam. viii. 1 we are told that David humiliated the\r      Philistines, and took the bridle of the mother city out of\r      their hands, or, in other words, destroyed the supremacy\r      which they had exercised over Israel; he probably did no\r      more than this, and failed to secure any part of their\r      territory. The passage in 1 Chron. xviii. 1, which\r      attributes to him the conquest of Gath and its dependencies,\r      is probably an amplification of the somewhat obscure wording\r      employed in 2 Sam. viii. 1.\r \r But though they suffered no loss of territory, their position was in\r reality much inferior to what it was before. Their control of the plain\r of Jezreel was lost to them for ever, and with it the revenue which they\r had levied from passing caravans: the Hebrews transferred to themselves\r this right of their former masters, and were so much the richer at their\r expense. To the five cities this was a more damaging blow than twenty\r reverses would have been to Benjamin or Judah. The military spirit had\r not died out among the Philistines, and they were still capable of any\r action which did not require sustained effort; but lack of resources\r prevented them from entering on a campaign of any length, and any chance\r they may at one time have had of exercising a dominant influence in the\r affairs of Southern Syria had passed away. Under the restraining hand\r of Egypt they returned to the rank of a second-rate power, just strong\r enough to inspire its neighbours with respect, but too weak to extend\r its territory by annexing that of others. Though they might still, at\r times, give David trouble by contesting at intervals the possession of\r some outlying citadel, or by making an occasional raid on one of\r the districts which lay close to the frontier, they were no longer a\r permanent menace to the continued existence of his kingdom.\r \r But was Judah strong enough to take their place, and set up in Southern\r Syria a sovereign state, around which the whole fighting material of the\r country might range itself with confidence? The incidents of the last\r war had clearly shown the disadvantages of its isolated position in\r regard to the bulk of the nation. The gap between Ekron and the Jordan,\r which separated it from Ephraim and Manasseh, had, at all costs, to be\r filled up, if a repetition of the manouvre which so nearly cost David\r his throne at Adullam were to be avoided. It is true that the Gibeonites\r and their allies acknowledged the sovereignty of Ephraim, and formed\r a sort of connecting link between the tribes, but it was impossible to\r rely on their fidelity so long as they were exposed to the attacks of\r the Jebusites in their rear: as soon therefore as David found he had\r nothing more to fear from the Philistines, he turned his attention\r to Jerusalem.* This city stood on a dry and sterile limestone spur,\r separated on three sides from the surrounding hills by two valleys of\r unequal length. That of the Kedron, on the east, begins as a simple\r depression, but gradually becomes deeper and narrower as it extends\r towards the south. About a mile and a half from its commencement it is\r nothing more than a deep gorge, shut in by precipitous rocks, which for\r some days after the winter rains is turned into the bed of a torrent.**\r \r      * The name Jerusalem occurs under the form Ursalîmmu, or\r      Urusalîm, in the Tel el-Amarna tablets. Sion was the name of\r      the citadel preserved by the Israelites after the capture of\r      the place, and applied by them to the part of the city which\r      contained the royal palace, and subsequently to the town\r      itself.\r \r      ** The Kedron is called a nalial (2 Sam. xv. 23; 1 Kings ii.\r      37; Jer. xxxi. 40), i.e. a torrent which runs dry during the\r      summer; in winter it was termed a brook. Excavations show\r      that the fall diminishes at the foot of the ancient walls,\r      and that the bottom of the valley has risen nearly twelve\r      yards.\r \r During the remainder of the year a number of springs, which well up at\r the bottom of the valley, furnish an unfailing supply of water to the\r inhabitants of Gibon,* Siloam,** and Eôgel.*** The valley widens out\r again near En-Kôgel, and affords a channel to the Wady of the Children\r of Hinnôm, which bounds the plateau on the west. The intermediate space\r has for a long time been nothing more than an undulating plain, at\r present covered by the houses of modern Jerusalem. In ancient times it\r was traversed by a depression in the ground, since filled up, which\r ran almost parallel with the Kedron, and joined it near the Pool of\r Siloam.**** The ancient city of the Jebusites stood on the summit of the\r headland which rises between these two valleys, the town of Jebus itself\r being at the extremity, while the Millo lay farther to the north on the\r hill of Sion, behind a ravine which ran down at right angles into the\r valley of the Hedron.\r \r      * Now, possibly, the Fountain of the Virgin, but its\r      identity is not certain.\r \r      ** These are the springs which feed the group of reservoirs\r      now known as the Pool of Siloam. The name Siloam occurs\r      only in Neh. iii. 15, but is undoubtedly more ancient.\r \r      *** En-Rôgel, the Travellers Well, is now called the\r      Well of Job.\r \r      **** This valley, which is not mentioned by name in the Old\r      Testament, was called, in the time of Josephus, the\r      Tyropoon, or CheesemakersQuarter. Its true position, which\r      had been only suspected up to the middle of the present\r      century, was determined with certainty by means of the\r      excavations carried out by the English and Germans. The\r      bottom of the valley was found at a depth of from forty to\r      sixty feet below the present surface.\r \r An unfortified suburb had gradually grown up on the lower ground to the\r west, and was connected by a stairway cut in the rock* with the upper\r city. This latter was surrounded by ramparts with turrets, like those\r of the Canaanitish citadels which we constantly find depicted on the\r Egyptian monuments. Its natural advantages and efficient garrison had so\r far enabled it to repel all the attacks of its enemies.\r \r      * This is the Ophel of the Hebrew text.\r \r When David appeared with his troops, the inhabitants ridiculed his\r presumption, and were good enough to warn him of the hopelessness of his\r enterprise: a garrison composed of the halt and the blind, without an\r able-bodied man amongst them, would, they declared, be able successfully\r to resist him. The king, stung by their mockery, made a promise to his\r mighty men that the first of them to scale the walls should be made\r chief and captain of his host. We often find that impregnable cities\r owe their downfall to negligence on the part of their defenders: these\r concentrate their whole attention on the few vulnerable points, and give\r but scanty care to those which are regarded as inaccessible.* Jerusalem\r proved to be no exception to this rule; Joab carried it by a sudden\r assault, and received as his reward the best part of the territory which\r he had won by his valour.**\r \r      * Cf. the capture of Sardis by Cyrus (Herodotus) and by\r      Antiochus III. (Polybius), as also the taking of the Capitol\r      by the Gauls.\r \r      ** The account of the capture of Jerusalem is given in 2\r      Sam. v. 6-9, where the text is possibly corrupt, with\r      interpolated glosses, especially in ver. 8; Davids reply to\r      the mockery of the Jebusites is difficult to understand. 1\r      Citron, xi. 4-8 gives a more correct text, but one less\r      complete in so far as the portions parallel with 2 Sam. v.\r      6-9 are concerned; the details in regard to Joab are\r      undoubtedly historical, but we do not find them in the Book\r      of Samuel.\r \r In attacking Jerusalem, Davids first idea was probably to rid himself\r of one of the more troublesome obstacles which served to separate\r one-half of his people from the other; but once he had set foot in the\r place, he was not slow to perceive its advantages, and determined to\r make it his residence. Hebron had sufficed so long as his power extended\r over Caleb and Judah only. Situated as it was in the heart of the\r mountains, and in the wealthiest part of the province in which it stood,\r it seemed the natural centre to which the Kenites and men of Judah must\r gravitate, and the point at which they might most readily be moulded\r into a nation; it was, however, too far to the south to offer a\r convenient rallying-point for a ruler who wished to bring the Hebrew\r communities scattered about on both banks of the Jordan under the sway\r of a common sceptre. Jerusalem, on the other hand, was close to the\r crossing point of the roads which lead from the Sinaitic desert into\r Syria, and from the Shephelah to the land of Gilead; it commanded\r nearly the whole domain of Israel and the ring of hostile races by which\r it was encircled. From this lofty eyrie, David, with Judah behind him,\r could either swoop down upon Moab, whose mountains shut him out from a\r view of the Dead Sea, or make a sudden descent on the seaboard, by way\r of Bethhoron, at the least sign of disturbance among the Philistines,\r or could push straight on across Mount Ephraim into Galilee. Issachar,\r Naphtali, Asher, Dan, and Zebulun were, perhaps, a little too far from\r the seat of government; but they were secondary tribes, incapable of\r any independent action, who obeyed without repugnance, but also without\r enthusiasm, the soldier-king able to protect them from external foes.\r The future master of Israel would be he who maintained his hold on the\r posterity of Judah and of Joseph, and David could not hope to find a\r more suitable place than Jerusalem from which to watch over the two\r ruling houses at one and the same time.\r \r The lower part of the town he gave up to the original inhabitants,* the\r upper he filled with Benjamites and men of Judah;** he built or restored\r a royal palace on Mount Sion, in which he lived surrounded by his\r warriors and his family.*** One thing only was lacking--a temple for his\r God. Jerubbaal had had a sanctuary at Ophrah, and Saul had secured the\r services of Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh: David was no longer satisfied\r with the ephod which had been the channel of many wise counsels during\r his years of adversity and his struggles against the Philistines. He\r longed for some still more sacred object with which to identify the\r fortunes of his people, and by which he might raise the newly gained\r prestige of his capital. It so happened that the ark of the Lord,\r the ancient safeguard of Ephraim, had been lying since the battle\r of Eben-ezer not far away, without a fixed abode or regular\r worshippers.****\r \r      * Judges i. 21; cf. Zech. xi. 7, where Ekron in its\r      decadence is likened to the Jebusite vassal of Judah.\r \r      ** Jerusalem is sometimes assigned to Benjamin (Judges i.\r      21), sometimes to Judah (Josh. xv. 63). Judah alone is\r      right.\r \r      *** 2 Sam. v. 9, and the parallel passage in 1 Chron. xi. 7,\r      8.\r \r      **** The account of the events which followed the battle of\r      Eben-ezer up to its arrival in the house of Abinadab, is\r      taken from the history of the ark, referred to on pp. 306,\r      307, supra. It is given in 1 Sam. v., vi., vii. 1, where it\r      forms an exceedingly characteristic whole, composed, it may\r      be, of two separate versions thrown into one; the passage in\r      1 Sam. vi. 15, where the Lévites receive the ark, is\r      supposed by some to be interpolated.\r \r The reason why it had not brought victory on that occasion, was that\r Gods anger had been stirred at the misdeeds committed in His name by\r the sons of Eli, and desired to punish His people; true, it had been\r preserved from profanation, and the miracles which took place in its\r neighbourhood proved that it was still the seat of a supernatural power.\r \r [Illustration: 340.jpg MOUSE OF METAL]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch published by Schick\r      and Oldfield Thomas.\r \r At first the Philistines had, according to their custom, shut it up in\r the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. On the morrow when the priests entered\r the sanctuary, they found the statue of their god prostrate in front of\r it, his fish-like body overthrown, and his head and hands scattered on\r the floor;* at the same time a plague of malignant tumours broke out\r among the people, and thousands of mice overran their houses. The\r inhabitants of Ashdod made haste to transfer it on to Ekron: it thus\r went the round of the five cities, its arrival being in each case\r accompanied by the same disasters. The soothsayers, being consulted\r at the end of seven months, ordered that solemn sacrifices should\r be offered up, and the ark restored to its rightful worshippers,\r accompanied by expiatory offerings of five golden mice and five golden\r tumours, one for each of the five repentant cities.**\r \r      * The statue here referred to is evidently similar to those\r      of the Chaldæan gods and genii, in which Dagon is\r      represented as a man with his back and head enveloped in a\r      fish as in a cloak.\r \r      ** In the Oustinoff collection at Jaffa, there is a roughly\r      shaped image of a mouse, cut out of a piece of white metal,\r      and perhaps obtained from the ruins of Gaza; it would seem\r      to be an ex-voto of the same kind as that referred to in the\r      Hebrew text, but it is of doubtful authenticity.\r \r The ark was placed on a new cart, and two milch cows with their calves\r drew it, lowing all the way, without guidance from any man, to the field\r of a certain Joshua at Bethshemesh. The inhabitants welcomed it with\r great joy, but their curiosity overcame their reverence, and they looked\r within the shrine. Jehovah, being angered thereat, smote seventy men of\r them, and the warriors made haste to bring the ark to Kirjath-jearim,\r where it remained for a long time, in the house of Abinadab on the\r hill, under charge of his son Eleazar.* Kirjath-jearim is only about two\r leagues from Jerusalem. David himself went thither, and setting the ark\r of God upon a new cart, brought it away.* Two attendants, called Uzzah\r and Ahio, drove the new cart, and David and all Israel played before\r God with all their might: even with songs, and with harps, and with\r psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.\r  An accident leading to serious consequences brought the procession to\r a standstill; the oxen stumbled, and their sacred burden threatened to\r fall: Uzzah, putting forth his hand to hold the ark, was smitten by the\r Lord, and there he died before the Lord. David was disturbed at this,\r feeling some insecurity in dealing with a Deity who had thus seemed to\r punish one of His worshippers for a well-meant and respectful act.**\r \r      * The text of 1 Sam. vi. 21, vii. 1, gives the reading\r      Kirjath-jearim, whereas the text of 2 Sam. vi. 2 has Baale-\r      Judah, which should be corrected to Baal-Judah. Baal-Judah,\r      or, in its abbreviated form, Baala, is another name for\r      Kirjath-jearim (Josh. xv. 9-11; cf. 1 Ghron. xiii. 6).\r      Similarly, we find the name Kirjath-Baal (Josh. xv. 60).\r      Kirjath-jearim is now Kharbet-el-Enab.\r \r      ** The transport of the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem\r      is related in 2 Sam. vi. and in 1 Ghron. xiii., xv., xvi.\r \r He was afraid of the Lord that day, and would not remove the ark to\r Jerusalem, but left it for three months in the house of a Philistine,\r Obed-Edom of Gath; but finding that its host, instead of experiencing\r any evil, was blessed by the Lord, he carried out his original\r intention, and brought the ark to Jerusalem. David, girded with a linen\r ephod, danced with all his might before the Lord, and all the house of\r Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound\r of the trumpet. When the ark had been placed in the tent that David had\r prepared for it, he offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and\r at the end of the festival there were dealt out to the people gifts of\r bread, cakes, and wine (or flesh). There is inserted in the narrative*\r an account of the conduct of Michal his wife, who looking out of the\r window and seeing the king dancing and playing, despised him in\r her heart, and when David returned to his house, congratulated him\r ironically--How glorious was the King of Israel to-day, who uncovered\r himself in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants!\r \r      * Renan would consider this to have been inserted in the\r      time of Hezekiah. It appeared to him to answer to the\r      antipathy of Hamutal and the ladies of the court to the\r      worship of Jahveh, and to that form of human respect which\r      restrained the people of the world from giving themselves up\r      to it.\r \r David said in reply that he would rather be held in honour by the\r handmaids of whom she had spoken than avoid the acts which covered him\r with ridicule in her eyes; and the chronicler adds that Michal the\r daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death. *\r \r      * [Davids reply shows (2 Sam. vi. 21, 22) that it was in\r      gratitude to Jehovah who had exalted him that he thus\r      humbled himself.--Tr.]\r \r The tent and the ark were assigned at this time to the care of two\r priests--Zadok, son of Ahitub, and Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, who was\r a descendant of Eli, and had never quitted David throughout his\r adventurous career.* It is probable, too, that the ephod had not\r disappeared, and that it had its place in the sanctuary; but it may have\r gradually fallen into neglect, and may have ceased to be the vehicle\r of oracular responses as in earlier years. The king was accustomed on\r important occasions to take part in the sacred ceremonies, after the\r example of contemporary monarchs, and he had beside him at this time a\r priest of standing to guide him in the religious rites, and to fulfil\r for him duties similar to those which the chief reader rendered to\r Pharaoh. The only one of these priests of David whose name has come down\r to us was Ira the Jethrite, who accompanied his master in his\r campaigns, and would seem to have been a soldier also, and one of the\r thirty. These priestly officials seem, however, to have played but a\r subordinate part, as history is almost silent about their acts.** While\r David owed everything to the sword and trusted in it, he recognised at\r the same time that he had obtained his crown from Jahveh; just as the\r sovereigns of Thebes and Nineveh saw in Amon and Assur the source of\r their own royal authority.\r \r      * 2 Sam. viii. 17, xx. 25; cf. 1 Sam. xxi. 1, xxii. 20; 1\r      Chron. xv. 11.\r \r      ** 2 Sam. xx. 26, where he is called the Jairite, and not\r      the Ithrite, owing to an easily understood confusion of the\r      Hebrew letters. He figures in the list of the _Gibborim_,\r      mighty men, 2 Sam. xxiii. 38.\r \r He consulted the Lord directly when he wished for counsel, and accepted\r the issue as a test whether his interpretation of the Divine will was\r correct or erroneous. When once he had realised, at the time of the\r capture of Jerusalem, that God had chosen him to be the champion of\r Israel, he spared no labour to accomplish the task which the Divine\r favour had assigned to him. He attacked one after the other the peoples\r who had encroached upon his domain, Moab being the first to feel the\r force of his arm. He extended his possessions at the expense of Gilead,\r and the fertile provinces opposite Jericho fell to his sword. These\r territories were in dangerous proximity to Jerusalem, and David\r doubtless realised the peril of their independence. The struggle for\r their possession must have continued for some time, but the details are\r not given, and we have only the record of a few incidental exploits: we\r know, for instance, that the captain of Davids guard, Benaiah, slew two\r Moabite notables in a battle.* Moabite captives were treated with all\r the severity sanctioned by the laws of war. They were laid on the ground\r in a line, and two-thirds of the length of the row being measured off,\r all within it were pitilessly massacred, the rest having their lives\r spared. Moab acknowledged its defeat, and agreed to pay tribute: it had\r suffered so much that it required several generations to recover.**\r \r      * 2 Sam. xxiii. 20-23: cf. 1 Chron. xi. 22-25. Ariel, who\r      is made the father of the two slain by Benaiah, may possibly\r      be the term in 11. 12, 17, 18 of the Inscription of Mesha\r      (Moabite Stone); but its meaning is obscure, and has\r      hitherto baffled all attempts to explain it.\r \r      ** 2 Sam. viii. 2.\r \r Gilead had become detached from Davids domain on the south, while\r the Ammonites were pressing it on the east, and the Ararnæans making\r encroachments upon its pasture-lands on the north. Nahash, King of the\r Ammonites, being dead, David, who had received help from him in his\r struggle with Saul, sent messengers to offer congratulations to his son\r Hanun on his accession. Hanun, supposing the messengers to be spies\r sent to examine the defences of the city, shaved off one-half of\r their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to\r their buttocks, and sent them away. This was the signal for war. The\r Ammonites, foreseeing that David would endeavour to take a terrible\r vengeance for this insult to his people, came to an understanding with\r their neighbours. The overthrow of the Amorite chiefs had favoured the\r expansion of the Aramæans towards the south. They had invaded all that\r region hitherto unconquered by Israel in the valley of the Litany to\r the east of Jordan, and some half-dozen of their petty states had\r appropriated among them the greater part of the territories which were\r described in the sacred record as having belonged previously to Jabin\r of Hazor and the kings of Bashan. The strongest of these\r principalities--that which occupied the position of Qodshû in the\r Bekâa, and had Zoba as its capital--was at this time under the rule of\r Hadadezer, son of Behob. This warrior had conquered Damascus, Maacah,\r and Geshur, was threatening the Canaanite town of Hamath, and was\r preparing to set out to the Euphrates when the Ammonites sought his help\r and protection. He came immediately to their succour. Joab, who was in\r command of Davids army, left a portion of his troops at Babbath under\r his brother Abishaî, and with the rest set out against the Syrians.\r He overthrew them, and returned immediately afterwards. The Ammonites,\r hearing of his victory, disbanded their army; but Joab had suffered such\r serious losses, that he judged it wise to defer his attack upon them\r until Zoba should be captured. David then took the field himself,\r crossed the Jordan with all his reserves, attacked the Syrians at\r Helam, put them to flight, killing Shobach, their general, and captured\r Damascus. Hadadezer [Hadarezer] made peace with Israel, and Tou or\r Toi, the King of Hamath, whom this victory had delivered, sent presents\r to David. This was the work of a single campaign. The next year Joab\r invested Kabbath, and when it was about to surrender he called the king\r to his camp, and conceded to him the honour of receiving the submission\r of the city in person. The Ammonites were treated with as much severity\r as their kinsmen of Moab. David put them under saws and harrows\r of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the\r brick-kiln. *\r \r      * The war with the Aramaeans, described in 2 Sam. viii. 3-\r      12, is similar to the account of the conflict with the\r      Ammonites in 2 Sam. x.-xii., but with more details. Both\r      documents are reproduced in 1 Chron. xviii. 3-11, and xix.,\r      xx. 1-3.\r \r [Illustration: 353.jpg THE HEBREW KINGDOM]\r \r This success brought others in its train. The Idumæans had taken\r advantage of the employment of the Israelite army against the Aramæans\r to make raids into Judah. Joab and Abishaî, despatched in haste to check\r them, met them in the Valley of Salt to the south of the Dead Sea, and\r gave them battle: their king perished in the fight, and his son Hadad\r with some of his followers took flight into Egypt. Joab put to the sword\r all the able-bodied combatants, and established garrisons at Petra,\r Elath, and Eziongeber* on the Red Sea. David dedicated the spoils to the\r Lord, who gave victory to David wherever he went.\r \r      Neither Elath nor Eziongeber are here mentioned, but 1 Kings\r      ix. 25-28 and 2 Chron. viii. 17, 18 prove that these places\r      had been occupied by David. For all that concerns Hadad, see\r      1 Kings xi. 15-20.\r \r Southern Syria had found its master: were the Hebrews going to pursue\r their success, and undertake in the central and northern regions a\r work of conquest which had baffled the efforts of all their\r predecessors--Canaanites, Amorites, and Hittites? The Assyrians, thrown\r back on the Tigris, were at this time leading a sort of vegetative\r existence in obscurity; and, as for Egypt, it would seem to have\r forgotten that it ever had possessions in Asia. There was, therefore,\r nothing to be feared from foreign intervention should the Hebrew be\r inclined to weld into a single state the nations lying between the\r Euphrates and the Red Sea.\r \r [Illustration: 354.jpg THE SITE OF RABBATH-AMON, SEEN FROM THE WEST]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from photograph No. 377 of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund._\r \r Unfortunately, the Israelites had not the necessary characteristics of\r a conquering people. Their history from the time of their entry into\r Canaan showed, it is true, that they were by no means incapable of\r enthusiasm and solidarity: a leader with the needful energy and good\r fortune to inspire them with confidence could rouse them from their\r self-satisfied indolence, and band them together for a great effort.\r But such concentration of purpose was ephemeral in its nature, and\r disappeared with the chief who had brought it about. In his absence,\r or when the danger he had pointed out was no longer imminent, they fell\r back instinctively into their usual state of apathy and disorganisation.\r Their nomadic temperament, which two centuries of a sedentary existence\r had not seriously modified, disposed them to give way to tribal\r quarrels, to keep up hereditary vendettas, to break out into sudden\r tumults, or to make pillaging expeditions into their neighbours\r territories. Long wars, requiring the maintenance of a permanent army,\r the continual levying of troops and taxes, and a prolonged effort to\r keep what they had acquired, were repugnant to them. The kingdom\r which David had founded owed its permanence to the strong will of its\r originator, and its increase or even its maintenance depended upon the\r absence of any internal disturbance or court intrigue, to counteract\r which might make too serious a drain upon his energy. David had survived\r his last victory sufficiently long to witness around him the evolution\r of plots, and the multiplication of the usual miseries which sadden, in\r the East, the last years of a long reign. It was a matter of custom as\r well as policy that an exaltation in the position of a ruler should be\r accompanied by a proportional increase in the number of his retinue\r and his wives. David was no exception to this custom: to the two wives,\r Abigail and Ahinoam, which he had while he was in exile at Ziklag, he\r now added Maacah the Aramaean, daughter of the King of Geshur, Haggith,\r Abital, Bglah, and several others.* During the siege of Babbath-Ammon he\r also committed adultery with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite,\r and, placing her husband in the forefront of the battle, brought about\r his death. Rebuked by the prophet Nathan for this crime, he expressed\r his penitence, but he continued at the same time to keep Bathsheba, by\r whom he had several children.** There was considerable rivalry among\r the progeny of these different unions, as the right of succession would\r appear not to have been definitely settled. Of the family of Saul,\r moreover, there were still several members in existence--the son which\r he had by Eizpah, the children of his daughter Merab, Merib-baal, the\r lame offspring of Jonathan,*** and Shimei****--all of whom had partisans\r among the tribes, and whose pretensions might be pressed unexpectedly at\r a critical moment.\r \r      * Ahinoam is mentioned in the following passages: 1 Sam.\r      xxv. 43, xxvii. 3, xxx. 5; 2 Sam. ii. 2, iii. 2; cf. also 1\r      Chron. iii. 1; Maacah in 2 Sam. iii. 3; 1 Chron. iii. 2;\r      Haggith in 2 Sam. iii. 4; 1 Kings i. 5, 11, ii. 13; 1 Chron.\r      iii. 2; Abital in 2 Sam. iii. 4; 1 Chron. iii. 3; Eglah in 2\r      Sam. iii. 5; 1 Chron. iii. 3. For the concubines, see 2 Sam.\r      v. 13, xv. 15, xvi. 21, 22; 1 Chron. iii. 9, xiv. 3.\r \r      ** 2 Sam. xi., xii. 7-25.\r \r      *** 2 Sam. ix., xvi. 1-4, xix. 25-30, where the name is\r      changed into Mephibosheth; the original name is given in 1\r      Chron. viii. 34.\r \r      **** Sam. xvi. 5-14, xix. 16-23; 1 Kings ii. 8, 9, 36-46.\r \r The eldest son of Ahinoam, Amnon, whose priority in age seemed likely\r to secure for him the crown, had fallen in love with one of his\r half-sisters named Tamar, the daughter of Maacah, and, instead of\r demanding her in marriage, procured her attendance on him by a feigned\r illness, and forced her to accede to his desires. His love was thereupon\r converted immediately into hate, and, instead of marrying her, he had\r her expelled from his house by his servants. With rent garments and\r ashes on her head, she fled to her full-brother Absalom. David was\r very wroth, but he loved his firstborn, and could not permit himself to\r punish him. Absalom kept his anger to himself, but when two years had\r elapsed he invited Amnon to a banquet, killed him, and fled to his\r grandfather Talmai, King of Geshur.*\r \r      * It is to be noted that Tamar asked Amnon to marry her, and\r      that the sole reproach directed against the kings eldest\r      son was that, after forcing her, he was unwilling to make\r      her his wife. Unions of brother and sister were probably as\r      legitimate among the Hebrews at this time as among the\r      Egyptians.\r \r His anger was now turned against the king for not having taken up the\r cause of his sister, and he began to meditate his dethronement. Having\r been recalled to Jerusalem at the instigation of Joab, Absalom\r prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him,\r  thus affecting the outward forms of royalty. Judah, dissatisfied at\r the favour shown by David to the other tribes, soon came to recognise\r Absalom as their chief, and some of the most intimate counsellors of the\r aged king began secretly to take his part. When Absalom deemed things\r safe for action, he betook himself to Hebron, under the pretence of a\r vow which he had made daring his sojourn at Geshur. All Judah rallied\r around him, and the excitement at Jerusalem was so great that David\r judged it prudent to retire, with his Philistine and Cherethite guards,\r to the other side of the Jordan. Absalom, in the mean while, took up his\r abode in Jerusalem, where, having received the tacit adherence of the\r family of Saul and of a number of the notables, he made himself king. To\r show that the rupture between him and David was complete, he had tents\r erected on the top of the house, and there, in view of the people, took\r possession of his fathers harem. Success would have been assured to\r him if he had promptly sent troops after the fugitives, but while he was\r spending his time in inactivity and feasting, David collected together\r those who were faithful to him, and put them under the command of\r Joab and Abishai. The kings veterans were more than a match for\r the undisciplined rabble which opposed them, and in the action which\r followed at Mahanaim Absalom was defeated: in his flight through\r the forest of Ephraim he was caught in a tree, and before he could\r disentangle himself was pierced through the heart by Joab.\r \r David, we read, wished his people to have mercy on his son, and he wept\r bitterly. He spared on this occasion the family of Saul, pardoned the\r tribe of Judah, and went back triumphantly into Jerusalem, which a few\r days before had taken part in his humiliation. The tribes of the house\r of Joseph had taken no side in the quarrel. They were ignorant alike of\r the motives which set the tribe of Judah against their own hero, and of\r their reasons for the zeal with which they again established him on the\r throne. They sent delegates to inquire about this, who reproached Judah\r for acting without their cognisance: We have ten parts in the king, and\r we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us,\r that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?\r  Judah answered with yet fiercer words; then Sheba, a chief of the\r Benjamites, losing patience, blew a trumpet, and went off crying: We\r have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of\r Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. If these words had produced\r an echo among the central and northern tribes, a schism would have been\r inevitable: some approved of them, while others took no action, and\r since Judah showed no disposition to put its military forces into\r movement, the king had once again to trust to Joab and the Philistine\r guards to repress the sedition. Their appearance on the scene\r disconcerted the rebels, and Sheba retreated to the northern frontier\r without offering battle. Perhaps he reckoned on the support of the\r Aramæans. He took shelter in the small stronghold of Abel of Bethmaacah,\r where he defended himself for some time; but just when the place was on\r the point of yielding, the inhabitants cut off Shebas head, and threw\r it to Joab from the wall. His death brought the crisis to an end,\r and peace reigned in Israel. Intrigues, however, began again more\r persistently than ever over the inheritance which the two slain princes\r had failed to obtain. The eldest son of the king was now Adonijah, son\r of Haggith, but Bathsheba exercised an undisputed sway over her husband,\r and had prepared him to recognise in Solomon her son the heir to the\r throne. She had secured, too, as his adherents several persons of\r influence, including Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah, the captain\r of the foreign guard.\r \r Adonijah had on his side Abiathar the priest, Joab, and the people of\r Jerusalem, who had been captivated by his beauty and his regal display.\r In the midst of these rivalries the king was daily becoming weaker: he\r was now very old, and although he was covered with wrappings he could\r not maintain his animal heat. A young girl was sought out for him to\r give him the needful warmth. Abishag, a Shunammite, was secured for the\r purpose, but her beauty inspired Adonijah with such a violent passion\r that he decided to bring matters to a crisis. He invited his brethren,\r with the exception of Solomon, to a banquet in the gardens which\r belonged to him in the south of Jerusalem, near the well of Eôgel. All\r his partisans were present, and, inspired by the good cheer, began to\r cry, God save King Adonijah! When Nathan informed Bathsheba of what\r was going on, she went in unto the king, who was being attended on by\r Abishag, complained to him of the weakness he was showing in regard to\r his eldest son, and besought him to designate his heir officially. He\r collected together the soldiers, and charged them to take the young\r man Solomon with royal pomp from the hill of Sion to the source of the\r Gibôn: Nathan anointed his forehead with the sacred oil, and in the\r sight of all the people brought him to the palace, mounted on his\r fathers mule. The blare of the coronation trumpets resounded in the\r ears of the conspirators, quickly followed by the tidings that Solomon\r had been hailed king over the whole of Israel: they fled on all sides,\r Adonijah taking refuge at the horns of the altar. David did not long\r survive this event: shortly before his death he advised Solomon to\r rid himself of all those who had opposed his accession to the throne.\r Solomon did not hesitate to follow this counsel, and the beginning of\r his reign was marked by a series of bloodthirsty executions. Adonijah\r was the first to suffer. He had been unwise enough to ask the hand of\r Abishag in marriage: this request was regarded as indicative of a hidden\r intention to rebel, and furnished an excuse for his assassination.\r Abiathar, at whose instigation Adonijah had acted, owed his escape\r from a similar fate to his priestly character and past services: he was\r banished to his estate at Anathoth, and Zadok became high priest in his\r stead. Joab, on learning the fate of his accomplice, felt that he was\r a lost man, and vainly sought sanctuary near the ark of the Lord; but\r Benaiah slew him there, and soon after, Shimei, the last survivor of the\r race of Saul, was put to death on some transparent pretext. This was the\r last act of the tragedy: henceforward Solomon, freed from all those who\r bore him malice, was able to devote his whole attention to the cares of\r government.*\r \r      * 1 Kings i., ii. This is the close of the history of David,\r      and follows on from 2 Sam. xxiv. It would seem that Adonijah\r      was heir-apparent (1 Kings i. 5, 6), and that Solomons\r      accession was brought about by an intrigue, which owed its\r      success to the old kings weakness (1 Kings i. 12, 13, 17,\r      18, 30, 31).\r \r The change of rulers had led, as usual, to insurrections among the\r tributary races: Damascus had revolted before the death of David, and\r had not been recovered. Hadad returned from Egypt, and having gained\r adherents in certain parts of Edom, resisted all attempts made to\r dislodge him.*\r \r      * It seems clear from the context that the revolt of\r      Damascus took place during Davids lifetime. It cannot, in\r      any case, have occurred at a later date than the beginning\r      of the reign of Solomon, for we are told that Rezôn, after\r      capturing the town, was an adversary of Israel all the days\r      of Solomon (1 Kings xi. 23-25). Hadad returned from Egypt\r      when he had heard that David slept with his fathers, and\r      that Joab the captain of the host was dead (1 Kings xi. 21,\r      22, 25).\r \r As a soldier, Solomon was neither skilful nor fortunate: he even failed\r to retain what his father had won for him. Though he continued to\r increase his army, it was more with a view to consolidating his power\r over the Bnê-Israel than for any aggressive action outside his borders.\r On the other hand, he showed himself an excellent administrator, and\r did his best, by various measures of general utility, to draw closer the\r ties which bound the tribes to him and to each other. He repaired the\r citadels with such means as he had at his disposal. He rebuilt the\r fortifications of Megiddo, thus securing the control of the network of\r roads which traversed Southern Syria. He remodelled the fortifications\r of Tamar, the two Bethhorons, Baâlath, Hazor, and of many other\r towns which defended his frontiers. Some of them he garrisoned with\r foot-soldiers, others with horsemen and chariots. By thus distributing\r his military forces over the whole country, he achieved a twofold\r object;* he provided, on the one hand, additional security from foreign\r invasion, and on the other diminished the risk of internal revolt.\r \r      * 1 Kings ix. 15, 17-19; cf. 2 Chron. viii. 4-6. The\r      parallel passage in 2 Chron. viii. 4, and the marginal\r      variant in the _Book of Kings_, give the reading Tadmor\r      Palmyra for Tamar, thus giving rise to the legends which\r      state that Solomons frontier extended to the Euphrates. The\r      Tamar here referred to is that mentioned in Ezeh. xlvii. 19,\r      xlviii. 28, as the southern boundary of Judah; it is perhaps\r      identical with the modern Kharbêt-Kurnub.\r \r The remnants of the old aboriginal clans, which had hitherto managed to\r preserve their independence, mainly owing to the dissensions among the\r Israelites, were at last absorbed into the tribes in whose territory\r they had settled. A few still held out, and only gave way after long\r and stubborn resistance: before he could triumph over Gezer, Solomon was\r forced to humble himself before the Egyptian Pharaoh. He paid homage to\r him, asked the hand of his daughter in marriage, and having obtained it,\r persuaded him to come to his assistance: the Egyptian engineers placed\r their skill at the service of the besiegers and soon brought the\r recalcitrant city to reason, handing it over to Solomon in payment for\r his submission.* The Canaanites were obliged to submit to the poll-tax\r and the _corvée_: the men of the league of Gibeon were made hewers\r of wood and drawers of water for the house of the Lord.** The Hebrews\r themselves bore their share in the expenses of the State, and though\r less heavily taxed than the Canaanites, were, nevertheless, compelled to\r contribute considerable sums; Judah alone was exempt, probably because,\r being the private domain of the sovereign, its revenues were already\r included in the royal exchequer.***\r \r      * 1 Kings ix. 16. The Pharaoh in question was probably one\r      of the Psiûkhânnît, the Psûsennos II. of Manetho.\r \r      ** 1 Kings ix. 20, 21. The annexation of the Gibeonites and\r      their allies is placed at the time of the conquest in Josh.\r      ix. 3-27; it should be rather fixed at the date of the loss\r      of independence of the league, probably in the time of\r      Solomon.\r \r      *** Stade thinks that Judah was not exempt, and that the\r      original document must have given thirteen districts.\r \r In order to facilitate the collection of the taxes, Solomon divided the\r kingdom into twelve districts, each of which was placed in charge of\r a collector; these regions did not coincide with the existing tribal\r boundaries, but the extent of each was determined by the wealth of the\r lands contained within it. While one district included the whole of\r Mount Ephraim, another was limited to the stronghold of Mahanaim and its\r suburbs. Mahanaim was at one time the capital of Israel, and had played\r an important part in the life of David: it held the key to the regions\r beyond Jordan, and its ruler was a person of such influence that it was\r not considered prudent to leave him too well provided with funds. By\r thus obliterating the old tribal boundaries, Solomon doubtless hoped\r to destroy, or at any rate greatly weaken, that clannish spirit which\r showed itself with such alarming violence at the time of the revolt of\r Sheba, and to weld into a single homogeneous mass the various Hebrew and\r Canaanitish elements of which the people of Israel were composed.*\r \r      * 1 Kings iv. 7-19, where a list of the districts is given;\r      the fact that two of Solomons sons-in-law appear in it,\r      show that the document from which it is taken gave the staff\r      of collectors in office at the close of his reign.\r \r Each of these provinces was obliged, during one month in each year,\r to provide for the wants of the king and his household, or, in other\r words, the requirements of the central government. A large part of these\r contributions went to supply the kings table; the daily consumption at\r the court was--thirty measures of fine flour, sixty measures of meal,\r ten fat oxen, twenty oxen out of the pastures, a hundred sheep, besides\r all kinds of game and fatted fowl: nor need we be surprised at these\r figures, for in a country where, and at a time when money was unknown,\r the king was obliged to supply food to all his dependents, the greater\r part of their emoluments consisting of these payments in kind. The\r tax-collectors had also to provide fodder for the horses reserved\r for military purposes: there were forty thousand of these, and twelve\r thousand charioteers, and barley and straw had to be forthcoming either\r in Jerusalem itself or in one or other of the garrison towns amongst\r which they were distributed.* The levying of tolls on caravans passing\r through the country completed the kings fiscal operations which were\r based on the systems prevailing in neighbouring States, especially that\r of Egypt.**\r \r      * 1 Kings iv. 26-28; the complementary passages in 1 Kings\r      x. 26 and 2 Chron. i. 14 give the number of chariots as 1400\r      and of charioteers at 12,000. The numbers do not seem\r      excessive for a kingdom which embraced the whole south of\r      Palestine, when we reflect that, at the battle of Qodshû,\r      Northern Syria was able to put between 2500 and 3000\r      chariots into the field against Ramses II. The Hebrew\r      chariots probably carried at least three men, like those of\r      the Hittites and Assyrians.\r \r      ** 1 Kings x. 15, where mention is made of the amount which\r      the chapmen brought, and the traffic of the merchants\r      contains an allusion to these tolls.\r \r Solomon, like other Oriental sovereigns, reserved to himself the\r monopoly of certain imported articles, such as yarn, chariots, and\r horses. Egyptian yarn, perhaps the finest produced in ancient times, was\r in great request among the dyers and embroiderers of Asia. Chariots,\r at once strong and light, were important articles of commerce at a time\r when their use in warfare was universal. As for horses, the cities of\r the Delta and Middle Egypt possessed a celebrated strain of stallions,\r from which the Syrian princes were accustomed to obtain their\r war-steeds.* Solomon decreed that for the future he was to be the sole\r intermediary between the Asiatics and the foreign countries supplying\r their requirements. His agents went down at regular intervals to the\r banks of the Nile to lay in stock; the horses and chariots, by the\r time they reached Jerusalem, cost him at the rate of six hundred silver\r shekels for each chariot, and one hundred and fifty shekels for each\r horse, but he sold them again at a profit to the Aramæan and Hittite\r princes. In return he purchased from them Cilician stallions, probably\r to sell again to the Egyptians, whose relaxing climate necessitated a\r frequent introduction of new blood into their stables.** By these and\r other methods of which we know nothing the yearly revenue of the kingdom\r was largely increased: and though it only reached a total which may seem\r insignificant in comparison with the enormous quantities of the precious\r metals which passed through the hands of the Pharaohs of that time, yet\r it must have seemed boundless wealth in the eyes of the shepherds and\r husbandmen who formed the bulk of the Hebrew nation.\r \r      * The terms in which the text, 1 Kings x. 27-29 (cf. 2\r      Citron, i. 16, 17), speaks of the trade in horses, show that\r      the traffic was already in existence when Solomon decided to\r      embark in it.\r \r      ** 1 Kings x. 27-29; 2 Chron. i. 16, 17. Kuê, the name of\r      Lower Cilicia, was discovered in the Hebrew text by Pr.\r      Lenormant. Winckler, with mistaken reliance on the authority\r      of Erman, has denied that Egypt produced stud-horses at this\r      time, and wishes to identify the Mizraim of the Hebrew text\r      with Musri, a place near Mount Taurus, mentioned in the\r      Assyrian texts.\r \r In thus developing his resources and turning them to good account,\r Solomon derived great assistance from the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon,\r a race whose services were always at the disposal of the masters of\r Southern Syria. The continued success of the Hellenic colonists on the\r eastern shores of the Mediterranean had compelled the Phoenicians to\r seek with redoubled boldness and activity in the Western Mediterranean\r some sort of compensation for the injury which their trade had thus\r suffered. They increased and consolidated their dealings with Sicily,\r Africa, and Spain, and established themselves throughout the whole of\r that misty region which extended beyond the straits of Gibraltar on the\r European side, from the mouth of the Guadalete to that of the Guadiana.\r This was the famous Tarshish--the Oriental El Dorado. Here they had\r founded a number of new towns, the most flourishing of which, Gadîr,*\r rose not far from the mouths of the Betis, on a small islet separated\r from the mainland by a narrow arm of the sea. In this city they\r constructed a temple to Melkarth, arsenals, warehouses, and shipbuilding\r yards: it was the Tyre of the west, and its merchant-vessels sailed to\r the south and to the north to trade with the savage races of the African\r and European seaboard. On the coast of Morocco they built Lixos, a town\r almost as large as Gadîr, and beyond Lixos, thirty days sail southwards,\r a whole host of depots, reckoned later on at three hundred.\r \r      * I do not propose to discuss here the question of the\r      identity of the country of Tartessos with the Tarshish or\r      Tarsis mentioned in the Bible (1 Kings x. 22).\r \r By exploiting the materials to be obtained from these lands, such as\r gold, silver, tin, lead, and copper, Tyre and Sidon were soon able to\r make good the losses they had suffered from Greek privateersmen and\r marauding Philistines. Towards the close of the reign of Saul over\r Israel, a certain king Abîbaal had arisen in Tyre, and was succeeded by\r his son Hiram, at the very moment when David was engaged in bringing\r the whole of Israel into subjection. Hiram, guided by instinct or by\r tradition, at once adopted a policy towards the rising dynasty which his\r ancestors had always found successful in similar cases. He made friendly\r overtures to the Hebrews, and constituted himself their broker and\r general provider: when David was in want of wood for the house he was\r building at Jerusalem, Hiram let him have the necessary quantity, and\r hired out to him workmen and artists at a reasonable wage, to help him\r in turning his materials to good account.*\r \r      * 2 Sam. v. 11; cf. the reference to the same incident in\r      1 Kings v 1-3.\r \r The accession of Solomon was a piece of good luck for him. The new king,\r born in the purple, did not share the simple and somewhat rustic tastes\r of his father. He wanted palaces and gardens and a temple, which might\r rival, even if only in a small way, the palaces and temples of Egypt and\r Chaldæa, of which he had heard such glowing accounts: Hiram undertook\r to procure these things for him at a moderate cost, and it was doubtless\r his influence which led to those voyages to the countries which produced\r precious metals, perfumes, rare animals, costly woods, and all those\r foreign knicknacks with which Eastern monarchs of all ages loved to\r surround themselves. The Phoenician sailors were well acquainted with\r the bearings of Puanît, most of them having heard of this country when\r in Egypt, a few perhaps having gone thither under the direction and by\r the orders of Pharaoh: and Hiram took advantage of the access which the\r Hebrews had gained to the shores of the Red Sea by the annexation of\r Edom, to establish relations with these outlying districts without\r having to pass the Egyptian customs. He lent to Solomon shipwrights and\r sailors, who helped him to fit out a fleet at Eziôn-geber, and undertook\r a voyage of discovery in company with a number of Hebrews, who were no\r doubt despatched in the same capacity as the royal messengers sent\r with the galleys of Hâtshopsîtû. It was a venture similar to those so\r frequently undertaken by the Egyptian admirals in the palmy days of the\r Theban navy, and of which we find so many curious pictures among the\r bas-reliefs at Deîr el-Baharî. On their return, after a three years\r absence, they reported that they had sailed to a country named Ophir,\r and produced in support of their statement a freight well calculated to\r convince the most sceptical, consisting as it did of four hundred and\r twenty talents of gold. The success of this first venture encouraged\r Solomon to persevere in such expeditions: he sent his fleet on several\r voyages to Ophir, and procured from thence a rich harvest of gold and\r silver, wood and ivory, apes and peacocks.*\r \r \r * 1 Kings ix. 26-28, x. 11, 12; cf. 2 Citron, viii. 17, 18, ix. 10, 11,\r 21. A whole library might be stocked with the various treatises which\r have appeared on the situation of the country of Ophir: Arabia, Persia,\r India, Java, and America have all been suggested. The mention of almug\r wood and of peacocks, which may be of Indian origin, for a long time\r inclined the scale in favour of India, but the discoveries of Mauch and\r Bent on the Zimbabaye have drawn attention to the basin of the Zambesi\r and the ruins found there. Dr. Peters, one of the best-known German\r explorers, is inclined to agree with Mauch and Bent, in their theory\r as to the position of the Ophir of the Bible. I am rather inclined to\r identify it with the Egyptian Pûanît, on the Somali or Yemen seaboard.\r \r Was the profit from these distant cruises so very considerable after\r all? After they had ceased, memory may have thrown a fanciful glamour\r over them, and magnified the treasures they had yielded to fabulous\r proportions: we are told that Solomon would have no drinking vessels or\r other utensils save those of pure gold, and that in his days silver was\r as stone, so common had it become.*\r \r      * 1 Kings x. 21, 27. In Chronicles the statement in the\r      _Book of Kings_ is repeated in a still more emphatic manner,\r      since it is there stated that gold itself was in Jerusalem\r      as stones (2 Chron. i. 15).\r \r [Illustration: 370.jpg MAP OF TYRE SUBSEQUENT TO HIRAM]\r \r Doubtless Hiram took good care to obtain his fall share of the gains.\r The Phoenician king began to find Tyre too restricted for him, the\r various islets over which it was scattered affording too small a space\r to support the multitudes which flocked thither. He therefore filled up\r the channels which separated them; by means of embankments and fortified\r quays he managed to reclaim from the sea a certain amount of land on the\r south; after which he constructed two harbours--one on the north, called\r the Sidonian; the other on the south, named the Egyptian. He was perhaps\r also the originator of the long causeway, the lower courses of which\r still serve as a breakwater, by which he transformed the projecting\r headland between the island and the mainland into a well-sheltered\r harbour. Finally, he set to work on a task like that which he had\r already helped Solomon to accomplish: he built for himself a palace\r of cedar-wood, and restored and beautified the temples of the gods,\r including the ancient sanctuary of Melkarth, and that of Astarté. In his\r reign the greatness of Phoenicia reached its zenith, just as that of the\r Hebrews culminated under David.\r \r [Illustration: 371.jpg THE BREAKWATER OF THE EGYPTIAN HARBOUR AT TYRE]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph published by the Duc de\r      Luynes.\r \r The most celebrated of Solomons works were to be seen at Jerusalem. As\r David left it, the city was somewhat insignificant. The water from its\r fountains had been amply sufficient for the wants of the little\r Jebusite town; it was wholly inadequate to meet the requirements of\r the growing-population of the capital of Judah. Solomon made better\r provision for its distribution than there had been in the past, and then\r tapped a new source of supply some distance away, in the direction of\r Bethlehem; it is even said that he made the reservoirs for its storage\r which still bear his name.*\r \r      * A somewhat ancient tradition attributes these works to\r      Solomon; no single fact confirms it, but the balance of\r      probability seems to indicate that he must have taken steps\r      to provide a water-supply for the new city. The channels and\r      reservoirs, of which traces are found at the present day,\r      probably occupy the same positions as those which preceded\r      them.\r \r [Illustration: 372.jpg one of Solomons reservoirs near Jerusalem]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. C. Alluaud of\r      Limoges.\r \r Meanwhile, Hiram had drawn up for him plans for a fortified residence,\r on a scale commensurate with the thriving fortunes of his dynasty. The\r main body was constructed of stone from the Judæan quarries, cut by\r masons from Byblos, but it was inlaid with cedar to such an extent that\r one wing was called the house of the forest-of-Lebanon. It contained\r everything that was required for the comfort of an Eastern potentate--a\r harem, with separate apartments for the favourites (one of which was\r probably decorated in the Egyptian manner for the benefit of Pharaohs\r daughter);* then there were reception-halls, to which the great men\r of the kingdom were admitted; storehouses, and an arsenal. The kings\r bodyguard possessed five hundred shields of beaten gold, which were\r handed over by each detachment, when the guard was relieved, to the\r one which took its place. But this gorgeous edifice would not have been\r complete if the temple of Jahveh had not arisen side by side with the\r abode of the temporal ruler of the nation. No monarch in those days\r could regard his position as unassailable until he had a sanctuary and a\r priesthood attached to his religion, either in his own palace or not far\r away from it. David had scarcely entered Jerusalem before he fixed upon\r the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite as a site for the temple,\r and built an altar there to the Lord during a plague which threatened to\r decimate his people; but as he did not carry the project any farther,**\r Solomon set himself to complete the task which his father had merely\r sketched out.\r \r      * 1 Kings vii. 8, ix. 24; 2 Ghron. viii. 11.\r \r      ** 2 Sam xxiv. 18-25, The threshing-floor of Araunah the\r      Jebusite is mentioned elsewhere as the site on which Solomon\r      built his temple (2 Ghron. iii. 1).\r \r The site was irregular in shape, and the surface did not\r naturally lend itself to the purpose for which it was destined. His\r engineers, however, put this right by constructing enormous piers for\r the foundations, which they built up from the slopes of the mountain\r or from the bottom of the valley as circumstances required: the space\r between this artificial casing and the solid rock was filled up, and\r the whole mass formed a nearly square platform, from which the temple\r buildings were to rise. Hiram undertook to supply materials for the\r work. Solomon had written to him that he should command that they\r hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy\r servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all\r that thou shalt say: for thou knowest that there is not among us\r any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians. Hiram was\r delighted to carry out the wishes of his royal friend with regard to the\r cedar and cypress woods.\r \r [Illustration: 374.jpg SOME OF THE STONE COURSE OF SOLOMONS TEMPLE AT\r JERUSALEM]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph.\r \r My servants, he answered, shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the\r sea: and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that\r thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and\r thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving\r food for my household. The payment agreed on, which was in kind,\r consisted of twenty thousand _kôr_ of wheat, and twenty _kôr_ of pure\r oil per annum, for which Hiram was to send to Jerusalem not only the\r timber, but architects, masons, and Gebalite carpenters (i.e. from\r Byblos), smelters, sculptors, and overseers.* Solomon undertook to\r supply the necessary labour, and for this purpose made a levy of men\r from all the tribes. The number of these labourers was reckoned at\r thirty thousand, and they were relieved regularly every three months;\r seventy thousand were occupied in the transport of the materials, while\r eighty thousand cut the stones from the quarry.**\r \r      * 1 Kings v. 7--11 * cf. 2 Chron. ii. 3--16, where the\r      writer adds 20,000 _kôr_ of barley, 20,000 baths of wine,\r      and the same quantity of oil.\r \r      ** 1 Kings v. 13-18; of. 2 Chron. ii. 1, 2, 17, 18.\r \r It is possible that the numbers may have been somewhat exaggerated in\r popular estimation, since the greatest Egyptian monuments never required\r such formidable levies of workmen for their construction; we must\r remember, however, that such an undertaking demanded a considerable\r effort, as the Hebrews were quite unaccustomed to that kind of labour.\r The front of the temple faced eastward; it was twenty cubits wide, sixty\r long, and thirty high. The walls were of enormous squared stones, and\r the ceilings and frames of the doors of carved cedar, plated with gold;\r it was entered by a porch, between two columns of wrought bronze, which\r were called Jachin and Boaz.*\r \r * 1 Kings vii. 15-22; cf. 2 Chron. iv. 11-13. The names were probably\r engraved each upon its respective column, and taken together formed an\r inscription which could be interpreted in various ways. The most simple\r interpretation is to recognise in them a kind of talismanic formula to\r ensure the strength of the building, affirming that it exists by the\r strength of God.\r \r The interior contained only two chambers; the _hekal,_ or holy place,\r where were kept the altar of incense, the seven-branched candlestick,\r and the table of shewbread; and the Holy of Holies--_debîr_--where the\r ark of God rested beneath the wings of two cherubim of gilded wood.\r Against the outer wall of the temple, and rising to half its height,\r were rows of small apartments, three stories high, in which were kept\r the treasures and vessels of the sanctuary. While the high priest was\r allowed to enter the Holy of Holies only once a year, the holy place was\r accessible at all times to the priests engaged in the services, and it\r was there that the daily ceremonies of the temple-worship took place;\r there stood also the altar of incense and the table of shewbread. The\r altar of sacrifice stood on the platform in front of the entrance; it\r was a cube of masonry with a parapet, and was approached by stone steps;\r it resembled, probably, in general outline the monumental altars which\r stood in the forecourts of the Egyptian temples and palaces. There stood\r by it, as was also customary in Chaldæa, a molten sea, and some ten\r smaller lavers, in which the Lévites washed the portions of the victims\r to be offered, together with the basins, knives, flesh-hooks, spoons,\r shovels, and other utensils required for the bloody sacrifice. A low\r wall surmounted by a balustrade of cedar-wood separated this sacred\r enclosure from a court to which the people were permitted to have\r free access. Both palace and temple were probably designed in that\r pseudo-Egyptian style which the Phoenicians were known to affect. The\r few Hebrew edifices of which remains have come down to us, reveal\r a method of construction and decoration common in Egypt; we have an\r example of this in the uprights of the doors at Lachish, which terminate\r in an Egyptian gorge like that employed in the naos of the Phonician\r temples.\r \r [Illustration: 377.jpg AN UPRIGHT OF A DOOR AT LACHISH]\r \r      Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from the drawing by Petrie.\r \r The completion of the whole plan occupied thirteen years; at length both\r palace and temple were finished in the XVIIth year of the kings\r reign. Solomon, however, did not wait for the completion of the work\r to dedicate the sanctuary to God. As soon as the inner court was ready,\r which was in his XIth year, he proceeded to transfer the ark to its new\r resting-place; it was raised upon a cubical base, and the long staves by\r which it had been carried were left in their rings, as was usual in the\r case of the sacred barks of the Egyptian deities.* The God of Israel\r thus took up His abode in the place in which He was henceforth to\r be honoured. The sacrifices on the occasion of the dedication were\r innumerable, and continued for fourteen days, in the presence of the\r representatives of all Israel. The ornate ceremonial and worship which\r had long been lavished on the deities of rival nations were now, for\r the first time, offered to the God of Israel. The devout Hebrews who\r had come together from far and near returned to their respective tribes\r filled with admiration,** and their limited knowledge of art doubtless\r led them to consider their temple as unique in the world; in fact, it\r presented nothing remarkable either in proportion, arrangement, or in\r the variety and richness of its ornamentation and furniture. Compared\r with the magnificent monuments of Egypt and Chaldæa, the work of Solomon\r was what the Hebrew kingdom appears to us among the empires of the\r ancient world--a little temple suited to a little people.\r \r      * 1 Kings viii. 6-8, and 2 Ghron. v. 7-9.\r \r      ** 1 Kings vi. 37, 38 states that the foundations were laid\r      in the IVth year of Solomons reign, in the month of Ziv,\r      and that the temple was completed in the month of Bui in the\r      XIth year; the work occupied seven years. 1 Kings vii. 1\r      adds that the construction of the palace lasted thirteen\r      years; it went on for six years after the completion of the\r      temple. The account of the dedication (1 Kings viii.)\r      contains a long prayer by Solomon, part of which (vers. 14-\r      66) is thought by certain critics to be of later date. They\r      contend that the original words of Solomon are confined to\r      vers. 12 and 13.\r \r The priests to whose care it was entrusted did not differ much from\r those whom David had gathered about him at the outset of the monarchy.\r They in no way formed an hereditary caste confined to the limits of\r a rigid hierarchy; they admitted into their number--at least up to a\r certain point--men of varied extraction, who were either drawn by their\r own inclinations to the service of the altar, or had been dedicated to\r it by their parents from childhood. He indeed was truly a priest who\r said of his father and mother, I have not seen him; neither did he\r acknowledge his brethren, nor knew he his own children. He was content,\r after renouncing these, to observe the law of God and keep His covenant,\r and to teach Jacob His judgments and Israel His law; he put incense\r before the Lord, and whole burnt offerings upon His altar.*\r \r      * Those are the expressions used in the Blessing of Moses\r      (Deut. xxxiii. 8-12); though this text is by some writers\r      placed as late as the VIIIth century B.C., yet the state of\r      things there represented would apply also to an earlier\r      date. The Hebrew priest, in short, had the same duties as a\r      large proportion of the priesthood in Chaldæ and Egypt.\r \r As in Egypt, the correct offering of the Jewish sacrifices was beset\r with considerable difficulties, and the risk of marring their efficacy\r by the slightest inadvertence necessitated the employment of men who\r were thoroughly instructed in the divinely appointed practices and\r formulæ. The victims had to be certified as perfect, while the offerers\r themselves had to be ceremonially pure; and, indeed, those only who had\r been specially trained were able to master the difficulties connected\r with the minutiae of legal purity. The means by which the future was\r made known necessitated the intervention of skilful interpreters of the\r Divine will. We know that in Egypt the statues of the gods were supposed\r to answer the questions put to them by movements of the head or arms,\r sometimes even by the living voice; but the Hebrews do not appear to\r have been influenced by any such recollections in the use of their\r sacred oracles. We are ignorant, however, of the manner in which the\r ephod was consulted, and we know merely that the art of interrogating\r the Divine will by it demanded a long noviciate.* The benefits derived\r by those initiated into these mysteries were such as to cause them to\r desire the privileges to be perpetuated to their children. Gathered\r round the ancient sanctuaries were certain families who, from father\r to son, were devoted to the performance of the sacred rites, as, for\r instance, that of Eli at Shiloh, and that of Jonathan-ben-Gershom at\r Dan, near the sources of the Jordan; but in addition to these, the text\r mentions functionaries analogous to those found among the Canaanites,\r diviners, seers--_roê_--who had means of discovering that which was\r hidden from the vulgar, even to the finding of lost objects, but\r whose powers sometimes rose to a higher level when they were suddenly\r possessed by the prophetic spirit and enabled to reveal coming events.\r Besides these, again, were the prophets--_nabî_**--who lived either\r alone or in communities, and attained, by means of a strict training, to\r a vision of the future.\r \r      * An example of the consulting of the ephod will be found in\r      1 Sam. xxx. 7, 8, where David desires to know if he shall\r      pursue the Amalekites.\r \r      ** 1 Sam. ix. 9 is a gloss which identifies the _seer_ of\r      former times with the prophet of the times of the monarchy.\r \r Their prophetic utterances were accompanied by music and singing, and\r the exaltation of spirit which followed their exercises would at\r times spread to the bystanders,--as is the case in the zikr of the\r Mahomedans of to-day.*\r \r      * 1 Sam. x. 5-13, where we see Saul seized with the\r      prophetic spirit on meeting with a band of prophets\r      descending from the high place; cf. 2 Sam. vi. 13-16, 20-23,\r      for David dancing before the ark.\r \r The early kings, Saul and David, used to have recourse to individuals\r belonging to all these three classes, but the prophets, owing to the\r intermittent character of their inspiration and their ministry, could\r not fill a regular office attached to the court. One of this class was\r raised up by God from time to time to warn or guide His servants, and\r then sank again into obscurity; the priests, on the contrary, were\r always at hand, and their duties brought them into contact with the\r sovereign all the year round. The god who was worshipped in the capital\r of the country and his priesthood promptly acquired a predominant\r position in all Oriental monarchies, and most of the other temples,\r together with the sacerdotal bodies attached to them, usually fell into\r disrepute, leaving them supreme. If Amon of Thebes became almost the\r sole god, and his priests the possessors of all Egypt, it was because\r the accession of the XVIIIth dynasty had made his pontiffs the almoners\r of the Pharaoh. Something of the same sort took place in Israel; the\r priesthood at Jerusalem attached to the temple built by the sovereign,\r being constantly about his person, soon surpassed their brethren in\r other parts of the country both in influence and possessions. Under\r Davids reign their head had been Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, a\r descendant of Eli, but on Solomons accession the primacy had been\r transferred to the line of Zadok. In this alliance of the throne and\r the altar, it was natural at first that the throne should reap the\r advantage. The king appears to have continued to be a sort of high\r priest, and to have officiated at certain times and occasions.* The\r priests kept the temple in order, and watched over the cleanliness of\r its chambers and its vessels; they interrogated the Divine will for the\r king according to the prescribed ceremonies, and offered sacrifices on\r behalf of the monarch and his subjects; in short, they were at first\r little more than chaplains to the king and his family.\r \r      * Solomon officiated and preached at the consecration of the\r      temple (1 Kings viii.). The actual words appear to be of a\r      later date; but even if that be the case, it proves that, at\r      the time they were written, the king still possessed his\r      full sacerdotal powers.\r \r Solomons allegiance to the God of Israel did not lead him to proscribe\r the worship of other gods; he allowed his foreign wives the exercise of\r their various religions, and he raised an altar to Chemosh on the Mount\r of Olives for one of them who was a Moabite. The political supremacy and\r material advantages which all these establishments acquired for Judah\r could not fail to rouse the jealousy of the other tribes. Ephraim\r particularly looked on with ill-concealed anger at the prospect of the\r hegemony becoming established in the hands of a tribe which could be\r barely said to have existed before the time of David, and was to a\r considerable extent of barbarous origin. Taxes, homage, the keeping up\r and recruiting of garrisons, were all equally odious to this, as well\r as to the other clans descended from Joseph; meanwhile their burdens did\r not decrease. A new fortress had to be built at Jerusalem by order of\r the aged king. One of the overseers appointed for this work--Jeroboam,\r the son of Nebat--appears to have stirred up the popular discontent,\r and to have hatched a revolutionary plot. Solomon, hearing of the\r conspiracy, attempted to suppress it; Jeroboam was forewarned, and fled\r to Egypt, where Pharaoh Sheshonq received him with honour, and gave him\r his wifes sister in marriage.* The peace of the nation had not been\r ostensibly troubled, but the very fact that a pretender should have\r risen up in opposition to the legitimate king augured ill for the future\r of the dynasty. In reality, the edifice which David had raised with\r such difficulty tottered on its foundations before the death of his\r successor; the foreign vassals were either in a restless state or ready\r to throw off their allegiance; money was scarce, and twenty Galilæan\r towns had been perforce ceded to Hiram to pay the debts due to him for\r the building of the temple;** murmurings were heard among the people,\r who desired an easier life.\r \r      * 1 Kings xi. 23-40, where the LXX. is fuller than the A. V.\r \r      ** 1 Kings ix. 10-13; cf. 2 Cliron. viii. 1, 2, where the\r      fact seems to have been reversed, and Hiram is made the\r      donor of the twenty towns.\r \r In a future age, when priestly and prophetic influences had gained the\r ascendant, amid the perils which assailed Jerusalem, and the miseries of\r the exile, the Israelites, contrasting their humiliation with the glory\r of the past, forgot the reproaches which their forefathers had addressed\r to the house of David, and surrounded its memory with a halo of romance.\r David again became the hero, and Solomon the saint and sage of his race;\r the latter spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand\r and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even\r unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts,\r and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. We are told that\r God favoured him with a special predilection, and appeared to him on\r three separate occasions: once immediately after the death of David,\r to encourage him by the promise of a prosperous reign, and the gift\r of wisdom in governing; again after the dedication of the temple, to\r confirm him in his pious intentions; and lastly to upbraid him for his\r idolatry, and to predict the downfall of his house. Solomon is supposed\r to have had continuous dealings with all the sovereigns of the Oriental\r world,* and a Queen of Sheba is recorded as having come to bring him\r gifts from the furthest corner of Arabia.\r \r      * 1 Kings iv. 34; on this passage are founded all the\r      legends dealing with the contests of wit and wisdom in which\r      Solomon was supposed to have entered with the kings of\r      neighbouring countries; traces of these are found in Dius,\r      in Menander, and in Eupolemus.\r \r His contemporaries, however, seem to have regarded him as a tyrant who\r oppressed them with taxes, and whose death was unregretted.*\r \r      * I am inclined to place the date of Solomons death between\r      935 and 930 B.C.\r \r [Illustration: 384.jpg King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba]\r \r His son Rehoboam experienced no opposition in Jerusalem and Judah on\r succeeding to the throne of his father; when, however, he repaired to\r Shechem to receive the oath of allegiance from the northern and central\r tribes, he found them unwilling to tender it except under certain\r conditions; they would consent to obey him only on the promise of his\r delivering them from the forced labour which had been imposed upon them\r by his predecessors. Jeroboam, who had returned from his Egyptian exile\r on the news of Solomons death, undertook to represent their grievances\r to the new king. Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make\r thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put\r upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. Rehoboam demanded three\r days for the consideration of his reply; he took counsel with the old\r advisers of the late king, who exhorted him to comply with the petition,\r but the young men who were his habitual companions urged him, on the\r contrary, to meet the remonstrances of his subjects with threats of\r still harsher exactions. Their advice was taken, and when Jeroboam again\r presented himself, Rehoboam greeted him with raillery and threats. My\r little finger is thicker than my fathers loins. And now whereas my\r father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke:\r my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with\r scorpions. This unwise answer did not produce the intimidating effect\r which was desired; the cry of revolt, which had already been raised in\r the earlier days of the monarchy, was once more heard. What portion\r have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:\r to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. Rehoboam\r attempted to carry his threats into execution, and sent the collectors\r of taxes among the rebels to enforce payment; but one of them was stoned\r almost before his eyes, and the king himself had barely time to regain\r his chariot and flee to Jerusalem to escape an outburst of popular\r fury. The northern and central tribes immediately offered the crown to\r Jeroboam, and the partisans of the son of Solomon were reduced to those\r of his own tribe; Judah, Caleb, the few remaining Simeonites, and some\r of the towns of Dan and Benjamin, which were too near to Jerusalem to\r escape the influence of a great city, were all who threw in their lot\r with him.*\r \r      * 1 Kings xii. 1--24; cf. 2 Chron. x., xi. 1-4. The text of\r      1 Kings xii. 20 expressly says, there was none that\r      followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah only;\r       whereas the following verse, which some think to have been\r      added by another hand, adds that Rehoboam assembled 180,000\r      men which were warriors from the house of Judah and the\r      tribe of Benjamin.\r \r Thus was accomplished the downfall of the House of David, and with it\r the Hebrew kingdom which it had been at such pains to build up. When we\r consider the character of the two kings who formed its sole dynasty, we\r cannot refrain from thinking that it deserved a better fate. David\r and Solomon exhibited that curious mixture of virtues and vices which\r distinguished most of the great Semite princes. The former, a soldier\r of fortune and an adventurous hero, represents the regular type of the\r founder of a dynasty; crafty, cruel, ungrateful, and dissolute, but\r at the same time brave, prudent, cautious, generous, and capable of\r enthusiasm, clemency, and repentance; at once so lovable and so gentle\r that he was able to inspire those about him with the firmest friendship\r and the most absolute devotion. The latter was a religious though\r sensual monarch, fond of display--the type of sovereign who usually\r succeeds to the head of the family and enjoys the wealth which his\r predecessor had acquired, displaying before all men the results of an\r accomplished work, and often thereby endangering its stability. The real\r reason of their failure to establish a durable monarchy was the fact\r that neither of them understood the temperament of the people they were\r called upon to govern. The few representations we possess of the Hebrews\r of this period depict them as closely resembling the nations which\r inhabited Southern Syria at the time of the Egyptian occupation. They\r belong to the type with which the monuments have made us familiar; they\r are distinguished by an aquiline nose, projecting cheek-bones, and curly\r hair and beard. They were vigorous, hardy, and inured to fatigue, but\r though they lacked those qualities of discipline and obedience which are\r the characteristics of true warrior races, David had not hesitated to\r employ them in war; they were neither sailors, builders, nor given to\r commerce and industries, and yet Solomon built fleets, raised palaces\r and a temple, and undertook maritime expeditions, and financial\r circumstances seemed for the moment to be favourable.\r \r [Illustration: 387.jpg A JEWISH CAPTIVE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Petrie.\r \r The onward progress of Assyria towards the Mediterranean had been\r arrested by the Hittites, Egypt was in a condition of lethargy, the\r Aramæan populations were fretting away their energies in internal\r dissensions; David, having encountered no serious opposition after his\r victory over the Philistines, had extended his conquests and increased\r the area of his kingdom, and the interested assistance which Tyre\r afterwards gave to Solomon enabled the latter to realise his dreams of\r luxury and royal magnificence. But the kingdom which had been created\r by David and Solomom rested solely on their individual efforts, and its\r continuance could be ensured only by bequeathing it to descendants who\r had sufficient energy and prudence to consolidate its weaker elements,\r and build up the tottering materials which were constantly threatening\r to fall asunder. As soon as the government had passed into the hands\r of the weakling Rehoboam, who had at the outset departed from his\r predecessors policy, the component parts of the kingdom, which had\r for a few years been, held together, now became disintegrated without\r a shock, and as if by mutual consent. The old order of things which\r existed in the time of the Judges had passed away with the death of\r Saul. The advantages which ensued from a monarchical regime were too\r apparent to permit of its being set aside, and the tribes who had been\r bound together by nearly half a century of obedience to a common master\r now resolved themselves, according to their geographical positions, into\r two masses of unequal numbers and extent--Judah in the south, together\r with the few clans who remained loyal to the kingly house, and Israel in\r the north and the regions beyond Jordan, occupying three-fourths of the\r territory which had belonged to David and Solomon.\r \r Israel, in spite of its extent and population, did not enjoy the\r predominant position which we might have expected at the beginning of\r its independent existence. It had no political unity, no capital\r in which to concentrate its resources, no temple, and no army; it\r represented the material out of which a state could be formed rather\r than one already constituted. It was subdivided into three groups,\r formerly independent of, and almost strangers to each other, and between\r whom neither David nor Solomon had been able to establish any bond which\r would enable them to forget their former isolation. The centre group was\r composed of the House of Joseph--Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh--and\r comprised the old fortresses of Perea, Mahanaim, Penuel, Succoth,\r and Eamoth, ranged in a line running parallel with the Jordan. In the\r eastern group were the semi-nomad tribes of Reuben and Gad, who still\r persisted in the pastoral habits of their ancestors, and remained\r indifferent to the various revolutions which had agitated their race\r for several generations. Finally, in the northern group lay the smaller\r tribes of Asher, Naphtali, Issachar, Zebulon, and Dan, hemmed in between\r the Phoenicians and the Aramaeans of Zoba and Damascus. Each group had\r its own traditions, its own interests often opposed to those of its\r neighbours, and its own peculiar mode of life, which it had no intention\r of renouncing for any one elses benefit. The difficulty of keeping\r these groups together became at once apparent. Shechem had been the\r first to revolt against Rehoboam; it was a large and populous town,\r situated almost in the centre of the newly formed state, and the seat of\r an ancient oracle, both of which advantages seemed to single it out as\r the future capital. But its very importance, and the memories of its\r former greatness under Jeruhhaal and Abimelech, were against it. Built\r in the western territory belonging to Manasseh, the eastern and northern\r clans would at once object to its being chosen, on the ground that it\r would humiliate them before the House of Joseph, in the same manner as\r the selection of Jerusalem had tended to make them subservient to Judah.\r Jeroboam would have endangered his cause by fixing on it as his capital,\r and he therefore soon quitted it to establish himself at Tirzah. It is\r true that the latter town was also situated in the mountains of Ephraim,\r but it was so obscure and insignificant a place that it disarmed all\r jealousy; the new king therefore took up his residence in it, since he\r was forced to fix on some royal abode, but it never became for him what\r Jerusalem was to his rival, a capital at once religious and military. He\r had his own sanctuary and priests at Tirzah, as was but natural, but\r had he attempted to found a temple which would have attracted the whole\r population to a common worship, he would have excited jealousies which\r would have been fatal to his authority. On the other hand, Solomons\r temple had in its short period of existence not yet acquired such a\r prestige as to prevent Jeroboams drawing his people away from it:\r which he determined to do from a fear that contact with Jerusalem would\r endanger the allegiance of his subjects to his person and family. Such\r concourses of worshippers, assembling at periodic intervals from all\r parts of the country, soon degenerated into a kind of fair, in which\r commercial as well as religious motives had their part.\r \r [Illustration: 391.jpg THE MOUND AND PLAIN OF BETHEL.]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the photograph published by the Duc\r      de Luynes.\r \r These gatherings formed a source of revenue to the prince in\r whose capital they were held, and financial as well as political\r considerations required that periodical assemblies should be established\r in Israel similar to those which attracted Judah to Jerusalem. Jeroboam\r adopted a plan which while safeguarding the interests of his treasury,\r prevented his becoming unpopular with his own subjects; as he was\r unable to have a temple for himself alone, he chose two out of the most\r venerated ancient sanctuaries, that of Dan for the northern tribes, and\r that of Bethel, on the Judæan frontier, for the tribes of the east and\r centre. He made two calves of gold, one for each place, and said to the\r people, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold thy gods,\r O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. He granted\r the sanctuaries certain appanages, and established a priesthood\r answering to that which officiated in the rival kingdom: whosoever\r would he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high\r places. * While Jeroboam thus endeavoured to strengthen himself on the\r throne by adapting the monarchy to the temperament of the tribes over\r which he ruled, Rehoboam took measures to regain his lost ground and\r restore the unity which he himself had destroyed. He recruited the army\r which had been somewhat neglected in the latter years of his father,\r restored the walls of the cities which had remained faithful to him, and\r fortified the places which constituted his frontier defences against the\r Israelites.** His ambition was not as foolish as we might be tempted to\r imagine. He had soldiers, charioteers, generals, skilled in the art of\r war, well-filled storehouses, the remnant of the wealth of Solomon, and,\r as a last resource, the gold of the temple at Jerusalem. He ruled over\r the same extent of territory as that possessed by David after the death\r of Saul, but the means at his disposal were incontestably greater than\r those of his grandfather, and it is possible that he might in the\r end have overcome Jeroboam, as David overcame Ishbosheth, had not the\r intervention of Egypt disconcerted his plans, and, by exhausting his\r material forces, struck a death-blow to all his hopes.\r \r      * 1 Kings xii. 25-32; chaps, xii. 33, xiii., xiv. 1-18\r      contain, side by side with the narrative of facts, such as\r      the death of Jeroboams son, comments on the religious\r      conduct of the sovereign, which some regard as being of\r      later date.\r \r      ** 1 Kings xii. 21-24; cf. 2 Ghron. xi. 1-17, where the list\r      of strongholds, wanting in the Boole of Kings, is given from\r      an ancient source. The writer affirms, in harmony with the\r      ideas of his time, that the Lévites left their suburbs and\r      their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for\r      Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not\r      execute the Priests office unto the Lord.\r \r The century and a half which had elapsed since the death of the last of\r the Ramessides had, as far as we can ascertain, been troubled by civil\r wars and revolutions.*\r \r * I have mentioned above the uncertainty which still shrouds the XXth\r dynasty. The following is the order in which I propose that its kings\r should be placed:--\r \r [Illustration: 393.jpg TABLE OF KINGS]\r \r The imperious Egypt of the Theban dynasties had passed away, but a new\r Egypt had arisen, not without storm and struggle, in its place. As long\r as the campaigns of the Pharaohs had been confined to the Nile valley\r and the Oases, Thebes had been the natural centre of the kingdom; placed\r almost exactly between the Mediterranean and the southern frontier, it\r had been both the national arsenal and the treasure-house to which all\r foreign wealth had found its way from the Persian Gulf to the Sahara,\r and from the coasts of Asia Minor to the equatorial swamps. The cities\r of the Delta, lying on the frontier of those peoples with whom Egypt\r now held but little intercourse, possessed neither the authority nor the\r resources of Thebes; even Memphis, to which the prestige of her ancient\r dynasties still clung, occupied but a secondary place beside her rival.\r The invasion of the shepherds, by making the Thebaid the refuge and\r last bulwark of the Egyptian nation, increased its importance: in the\r critical times of the struggle, Thebes was not merely the foremost city\r in the country, it represented the country itself, and the heart of\r Egypt may be said to have throbbed within its walls. The victories of\r Ahmosis, the expeditions of Thûtmosis I. and Thûtmosis III., enlarged\r her horizon; her Pharaohs crossed the isthmus of Suez, they conquered\r Syria, subdued the valleys of the Euphrates and the Balîkh, and by so\r doing increased her wealth and her splendour. Her streets witnessed\r during two centuries processions of barbarian prisoners laden with the\r spoils of conquest. But with the advent of the XIXth and XXth dynasties\r came anxious times; the peoples of Syria and Libya, long kept in\r servitude, at length rebelled, and the long distance between Karnak and\r Gaza soon began to be irksome to princes who had to be constantly on\r the alert on the Canaanite frontier, and who found it impossible to have\r their head-quarters six hundred miles from the scene of hostilities.\r Hence it came about that Ramses II., Mînephtah, and Ramses III. all\r took up their abode in the Delta during the greater part of their active\r life; they restored its ancient towns and founded new ones, which\r soon acquired considerable wealth by foreign commerce. The centre\r of government of the empire, which, after the dissolution of the old\r Memphite state, had been removed southwards to Thebes on account of the\r conquest of Ethiopia and the encroachment of Theban civilization upon\r Nubia and the Sudan, now gradually returned northwards, and passing over\r Heracleo-polis, which had exercised a transitory supremacy, at length\r established itself in the Delta. Tanis, Bubastis, Sais, Mondes, and\r Sebennytos all disputed the honour of forming the royal residence, and\r all in turn during the course of ages enjoyed the privilege without ever\r rising to the rank of Thebes, or producing any sovereigns to be compared\r with those of her triumphant dynasties. Tanis was, as we have seen, the\r first of these to rule the whole of the Nile valley. Its prosperity had\r continued to increase from the time that Ramses II. began to rebuild it;\r the remaining inhabitants of Avaris, mingled with the natives of pure\r race and the prisoners of war settled there, had furnished it with an\r active and industrious population, which had considerably increased\r during the peaceful reigns of the XXth dynasty. The surrounding country,\r drained and cultivated by unremitting efforts, became one of the most\r fruitful parts of the Delta; there was a large exportation of fish\r and corn, to which were soon added the various products of its\r manufactories, such as linen and woollen stuffs, ornaments, and objects\r in glass and in precious metals.*\r \r      * The immense number of designs taken from aquatic plants,\r      as, for instance, the papyrus and the lotus, single or in\r      groups, as well as from fish and aquatic birds, which we\r      observe on objects of Phoenician goldsmiths work, leads me\r      to believe that the Tyrian and Sidonian artists borrowed\r      most of their models from the Delta, and doubtless from\r      Tanis, the most flourishing town of the Delta during the\r      centuries following the downfall of Thebes.\r \r These were embarked on Egyptian or Phoenician galleys, and were\r exchanged in the ports of the Mediterranean for Syrian, Asiatic, or\r Ægean commodities, which were then transmitted by the Egyptian merchants\r to the countries of the East and to Northern Africa.* The port of Tanis\r was one of the most secure and convenient which existed at that period.\r It was at sufficient distance from the coast to be safe from the sudden\r attacks of pirates,** and yet near enough to permit of its being reached\r from the open by merchantmen in a few hours of easy navigation; the arms\r of the Nile, and the canals which here flowed into the sea, were broad\r and deep, and, so long as they were kept well dredged, would allow the\r heaviest-laden vessel of large draught to make its way up them with\r ease.\r \r      * It was from Tanis that the Egyptian vessel set out\r      carrying the messengers of Hrihor to Byblos.\r \r      ** We may judge of the security afforded by such a position\r      by the account in Homer which Ulysses gives to Eumaios of\r      his pretended voyage to Egypt; the Greeks having\r      disembarked, and being scattered over the country, were\r      attacked by the Egyptians before they could capture a town\r      or carry their booty to the ships.\r \r The site of the town was not less advantageous for overland traffic.\r Tanis was the first important station encountered by caravans after\r crossing the frontier at Zalû, and it offered them a safe and convenient\r emporium for the disposal of their goods in exchange for the riches of\r Egypt and the Delta. The combination of so many advantageous features\r on one site tended to the rapid development of both civic and individual\r wealth; in less than three centuries after its rebuilding by Ramses II.,\r Tanis had risen to a position which enabled its sovereigns to claim even\r the obedience of Thebes itself.\r \r We know very little of the history of this Tanite dynasty; the monuments\r have not revealed the names of all its kings, and much difficulty is\r experienced in establishing the sequence of those already brought to\r light.*\r \r \r * The classification of the Tanite line has been complicated in the\r minds of most Egyptologists by the tendency to ignore the existence\r of the sacerdotal dynasty of high priests, to confuse with the Tanite\r Pharaohs those of the high priests who bore the crown, and to identify\r in the lists of Manetho (more or less corrected) the names they are\r in search of. A fresh examination of the subject has led me to adopt\r provisionally the following order for the series of Tanite kings:--\r \r [Illustration: 397.jpg TABLE OF KINGS]\r \r Their actual domain barely extended as far as Siut, but their suzerainty\r was acknowledged by the Said as well as by all or part of Ethiopia, and\r the Tanite Pharaohs maintained their authority with such vigour, that\r they had it in their power on several occasions to expel the high\r priests of Amon, and to restore, at least for a time, the unity of the\r empire. To accomplish this, it would have been sufficient for them to\r have assumed the priestly dignity at Thebes, and this was what no doubt\r took place at times when a vacancy in the high priesthood occurred;\r but it was merely in an interim, and the Tanite sovereigns always\r relinquished the office, after a brief lapse of time, in favour of some\r member of the family of Hrihor whose right of primogeniture entitled him\r to succeed to it.* It indeed seemed as if custom and religious etiquette\r had made the two offices of the pontificate and the royal dignity\r incompatible for one individual to hold simultaneously. The priestly\r duties had become marvellously complicated during the Theban hegemony,\r and the minute observances which they entailed absorbed the whole life\r of those who dedicated themselves to their performance.**\r \r      * This is only true if the personage who entitles himself\r      once within a cartouche, the Master of the two lands, First\r      Prophet of Amon, Psiûkhân-nît, is really the Tanite king,\r      and not the high priest Psiûkhânnît.\r \r      ** The first book of Diodorus contains a picture of the life\r      of the kings of Egypt, which, in common with much\r      information contained in the work, is taken from a lost book\r      of Hecataeus. The historical romance written by the latter\r      appears to have been composed from information taken from\r      Theban sources. The comparison of it with the inscribed\r      monuments and the ritual of the cultus of Amon proves that\r      the ideal description given in this work of the life of the\r      kings, merely reproduces the chief characteristics of the\r      lives of the Theban and Ethiopian high priests; hence the\r      greater part of the minute observances which we remark\r      therein apply to the latter only, and not to the Pharaohs\r      properly so called.\r \r They had daily to fulfil a multitude of rites, distributed over the\r various hours in such a manner that it seemed impossible to find leisure\r for any fresh occupation without encroaching on the time allotted to\r absolute bodily needs. The high priest rose each morning at an appointed\r hour; he had certain times for taking food, for recreation, for giving\r audience, for dispensing justice, for attending to worldly affairs, and\r for relaxation with his wives and children; at night he kept watch, or\r rose at intervals to prepare for the various ceremonies which could only\r be celebrated at sunrise. He was responsible for the superintendence of\r the priests of Amon in the numberless festivals held in honour of the\r gods, from which he could not absent himself except for some legitimate\r reason. From all this it will be seen how impossible it was for a lay\r king, like the sovereign ruling at Tanis, to submit to such restraints\r beyond a certain point; his patience would soon have become exhausted,\r want of practice would have led him to make slips or omissions,\r rendering the rites null and void; and the temporal affairs of his\r kingdom--internal administration, justice, finance, commerce, and\r war--made such demands upon his time, that he was obliged as soon as\r possible to find a substitute to fulfil his religious duties. The force\r of circumstances therefore maintained the line of Theban high priests\r side by side with their sovereigns, the Tanite kings. They were, it is\r true, dangerous rivals, both on account of the wealth of their fief and\r of the immense prestige which they enjoyed in Egypt, Ethiopia, and in\r all the nomes devoted to the worship of Amon. They were allied to the\r elder branch of the ramessides, and had thus inherited such near rights\r to the crown that Smendes had not hesitated to concede to Hrihor the\r cartouches, the preamble, and insignia of the Pharaoh, including the\r pschent and the iron helmet inlaid with gold. This concession, however,\r had been made as a personal favour, and extended only to the lifetime of\r Hrihor, without holding good, as a matter of course, for his successors;\r his son Piônkhi had to confine himself to the priestly titles,* and his\r grandson Paînotmû enjoyed the kingly privileges only during part of his\r life, doubtless in consequence of his marriage with a certain Mâkerî,\r probably daughter of Psiûkhânnît L, the Tanite king. Mâkerî apparently\r died soon after, and the discovery of her coffin in the hiding-place at\r Deîr el-Baharî reveals the fact of her death in giving birth to a little\r daughter who did not survive her, and who rests in the same\r coffin beside the mummy of her mother. None of the successors\r of Paînotmû--Masahirti, Manakhpirrî, Paînotmû II., Psiûkhânnît,\r Nsbindîdi--enjoyed a similar distinction, and if one of them happened to\r surround his name with a cartouche, it was done surreptitiously, without\r the authority of the sovereign.**\r \r      * The only monument of this prince as yet known gives him\r      merely the usual titles of the high priest, and the\r      inscriptions of his son Paînotmû I. style him First Prophet\r      of Amon. His name should probably be read Paîônûkhi or\r      Piônûkhi, rather than Pionkhi or Piânkhi. It is not unlikely\r      that some of the papyri published by Spiegelberg date from\r      his pontificate.\r \r      ** Manakhpirrî often places his name in a square cartouche\r      which tends at times to become an oval, but this is the case\r      only on some pieces of stuff rolled round a mummy and on\r      some bricks concealed in the walls of el-Hibeh, Thebes, and\r      Gebeleîn. If the Psiûkhânnît, High Priest of Amon, who\r      once (to our knowledge) enclosed his name in a cartouche, is\r      really a high priest, and not a king, his case would be\r      analogous to that of Manakhpirrî.\r \r Paînotmû II. contented himself with drawing attention to his\r connection with the reigning house, and styled himself Royal Son of\r Psiûkhânnît-Mîamon, on account of his ancestress Mâkerî having been the\r daughter of the Pharaoh Psiûkhânnît.*\r \r      * The example of the royal sons of Ramses explains the\r      variant which makes Paînotmû, son of Manakhpirrî, into\r      Paînotmû, royal son of Psiûkhânnît-Mîamon.\r \r The relationship of which he boasted was a distant one, but many of his\r contemporaries who claimed to be of the line of Sesostris, and called\r themselves royal sons of Ramses, traced their descent from a far more\r remote ancestor.\r \r [Illustration: 401.jpg THE MUMMIES OF QUEEN MÂKERÎ AND HER CHILD]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-\r      Bey.\r \r The death of one high priest, or the appointment of his successor, was\r often the occasion of disturbances; the jealousies between his children\r by the same or by different wives were as bitter as those which existed\r in the palace of the Pharaohs, and the suzerain himself was obliged\r at times to interfere in order to restore peace. It was owing to an\r intervention of this kind that Manakhpirrî was called on to replace his\r brother Masahirti. A section of the Theban population had revolted,\r but the rising had been put down by the Tanite Siamon, and its leaders\r banished to the Oasis; Manakhpirrî had thereupon been summoned to court\r and officially invested with the pontificate in the XXVth year of the\r kings reign. But on his return to Karnak, the new high priest desired\r to heal old feuds, and at once recalled the exiles.* Troubles and\r disorders appeared to beset the Thebans, and, like the last of the\r Ramessides, they were engaged in a perpetual struggle against robbers.**\r \r      * This appears in the _Maunier Stele_ preserved for some\r      time in the Maison Française at Luxor, and now removed to\r      the Louvre.\r \r      ** The series of high priests side by side with the\r      sovereigns of the XXIst dynasty may be provisionally\r      arranged as follows:--\r \r [Illustration: 402.jpg TABLE]\r \r \r The town, deprived of its former influx of foreign spoil, became more\r and more impoverished, and its population gradually dwindled. The\r necropolis suffered increasingly from pillagers, and the burying-places\r of the kings were felt to be in such danger, that the authorities,\r despairing of being able to protect them, withdrew the mummies from\r their resting-places. The bodies of Seti I., Ramses II., and Ramses III.\r were once more carried down the valley, and, after various removals,\r were at length huddled together for safety in the tomb of Amenôthes I.\r at Drah-abul-Neggah.\r \r The Tanite Pharaohs seemed to have lacked neither courage nor good will.\r The few monuments which they have left show that to some extent they\r carried on the works begun by their predecessors. An unusually high\r inundation had injured the temple at Karnak, the foundations had been\r denuded by the water, and serious damage would have been done, had not\r the work of reparation been immediately undertaken. Nsbindîdi reopened\r the sandstone quarries between Erment and Grebeleîn, from which Seti I.\r had obtained the building materials for the temple, and drew from thence\r what was required for the repair of the edifice. Two of the descendants\r of Nsbindîdi, Psiûkhânnît I. and Amenemôpît, remodelled the little\r temple built by Kheops in honour of his daughter Honît-sonû, at the\r south-east angle of his pyramid. Both Siamonmîamon and Psiûkhânnît I.\r have left traces of their work at Memphis, and the latter inserted his\r cartouches on two of the obelisks raised by Ramses at Heliopolis. But\r these were only minor undertakings, and it is at Tanis that we must seek\r the most characteristic examples of their activity. Here it was that\r Psiûkhânnît rebuilt the brick ramparts which defended the city, and\r decorated several of the halls of the great temple. The pylons of this\r sanctuary had been merely begun by Sesostris: Siamon completed them,\r and added the sphinxes; and the metal plaques and small objects which he\r concealed under the base of one of the latter have been brought to light\r in the course of excavations. The appropriation of the monuments of\r other kings, which we have remarked under former dynasties, was also\r practised by the Tanites. Siamon placed his inscriptions over those of\r the Kamessides, and Psiûkhânnît engraved his name on the sphinxes and\r statues of Ame-nemhâît III. as unscrupulously as Apôphis and the Hyksôs\r had done before him. The Tanite sovereigns, however, were not at a loss\r for artists, and they had revived, after the lapse of centuries, the\r traditions of the local school which had flourished during the XIIth\r dynasty.\r \r [Illustration: 404.jpg THE TWO NILES OF TANIS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-\r      Bey.\r \r One of the groups, executed by order of Psiûkhânnît, has escaped\r destruction, and is now in the Gîzeh Museum. It represents two figures\r of the Nile, marching gravely shoulder to shoulder, and carrying in\r front of them tables of offerings, ornamented with fish and\r garnished with flowers. The stone in which they are executed is of an\r extraordinary hardness, but the sculptor has, notwithstanding, succeeded\r in carving and polishing it with a skill which does credit to his\r proficiency in his craft. The general effect of the figures is a\r little heavy, but the detail is excellent, and the correctness of pose,\r precision in modelling, and harmony of proportion are beyond criticism.\r The heads present a certain element of strangeness. The artist evidently\r took as his model, as far as type and style of head-dress are concerned,\r the monuments of Amenemhâît III. which he saw around him; indeed, he\r probably copied one of them feature for feature. He has reproduced the\r severity of expression, the firm mouth, the projecting cheek-bones, the\r long hair and fan-shaped beard of his model, but he has not been able\r to imitate the broad and powerful treatment of the older artists; his\r method of execution has a certain hardness and conventionality which we\r never see to the same extent in the statues of the XIIth dynasty. The\r work is, however, an extremely interesting one, and we are tempted to\r wish that many more such monuments had been saved from the ruins of the\r city.*\r \r \r      * Mariette attributes this group to the Hyksôs; I have\r      already expressed the opinion that it dates from the XXIst\r      dynasty.\r \r The Pharaoh who dedicated it was a great builder, and, like most of\r his predecessors with similar tastes, somewhat of a conqueror. The\r sovereigns of the XXIst dynasty, though they never undertook any distant\r campaigns, did not neglect to keep up a kind of suzerainty over the\r Philistine Shephelah to which they still laid claim. The expedition\r which one of them, probably Psiûkhânnît II., led against Gezer, the\r alliance with the Hebrews and the marriage of a royal princess with\r Solomon, must all have been regarded at the court of Tanis as a partial\r revival of the former Egyptian rule in Syria. The kings were, however,\r obliged to rest content with small results, for though their battalions\r were sufficiently numerous and well disciplined to overcome the\r Canaanite chiefs, or even the Israelite kingdom, it is to be doubted\r whether they were strong enough to attack the troops of the Aramæan or\r Hittite princes, who had a highly organised military system, modelled\r on that of Assyria. Egyptian arms and tactics had not made much progress\r since the great campaigns of the Theban conquerors; the military\r authorities still complacently trusted to their chariots and their light\r troops of archers at a period when the whole success of a campaign was\r decided by heavily armed infantry, and when cavalry had already begun\r to change the issue of battles. The decadence of the military spirit\r in Egypt had been particularly marked in all classes under the later\r Ramessides, and the native militia, without exception, was reduced to a\r mere rabble--courageous, it is true, and able to sell their lives dearly\r when occasion demanded, rather than give way before the enemy, but\r entirely lacking that enthusiasm and resolution which sweep all\r obstacles before them. The chariotry had not degenerated in the same\r way, thanks to the care with which the Pharaoh and his vassals kept up\r the breeding of suitable horses in the training stables of the principal\r towns. Egypt provided Solomon with draught-horses, and with strong yet\r light chariots, which he sold with advantage to the sovereigns of the\r Orontes and the Euphrates. But it was the mercenaries who constituted\r the most active and effective section of the Pharaonic armies. These\r troops formed the backbone on which all the other elements--chariots,\r spearmen, and native archers--were dependent. Their spirited attack\r carried the other troops with them, and by a tremendous onslaught on the\r enemy at a decisive moment gave the commanding general some chance of\r success against the better-equipped and better-organised battalions that\r he would be sure to meet with on the plains of Asia. The Tanite kings\r enrolled these mercenaries in large numbers: they entrusted them with\r the garrisoning of the principal towns, and confirmed the privileges\r which their chiefs had received from the Ramessides, but the results of\r such a policy were not long in manifesting themselves, and this state\r of affairs had been barely a century in existence before Egypt became a\r prey to the barbarians.\r \r It would perhaps be more correct to say that it had fallen a prey to the\r Libyans only. The Asiatics and Europeans whom the Theban Pharaohs had\r called in to fight for them had become merged in the bulk of the nation,\r or had died out for lack of renewal. Semites abounded, it is true, in\r the eastern nomes of the Delta, but their presence had no effect on\r the military strength of the country. Some had settled in the towns\r and villages, and were engaged in commerce or industry; these included\r Phoenician, Canaanite, Edomite, and even Hebrew merchants and artisans,\r who had been forced to flee from their own countries owing to political\r disturbances.*\r \r      * Jeroboam (1 Kings xi. 40, xii. 2, 3) and Hadad (1 Kings\r      xi. 17-22) took refuge in this way at the court of Pharaoh.\r \r A certain proportion were descendants of the Hidjsôs, who had been\r reinforced from time to time by settlements of prisoners captured in\r battle; they had taken refuge in the marshes as in the times of Abmosis,\r and there lived in a kind of semi-civilized independence, refusing to\r pay taxes, boasting of having kept themselves from any alliances with\r the inhabitants of the Nile valley, while their kinsmen of the older\r stock betrayed the knowledge of their origin by such disparaging\r nicknames as Pa-shmûrî, the stranger, or Pi-âtnû, the Asiatic. The\r Shardana, who had constituted the body-guard of Ramses II., and whose\r commanders had, under Ramses III., ranked with the great officers of the\r crown, had all but disappeared. It had been found difficult to recruit\r them since the dislodgment of the People of the Sea from the Delta and\r the Syrian littoral, and their settlement in Italy and the fabulous\r islands of the Mediterranean; the adventurers from Crete and the Ægean\r coasts now preferred to serve under the Philistines, where they found\r those who were akin to their own race, and from thence they passed on to\r the Hebrews, where, under David and Solomon, they were gladly hired as\r mercenaries.*\r \r      * Carians or Cretans (Chercthites) formed part of Davids\r      body-guard (2 Sam viii. 18, xv. 18, xx. 23); one again meets\r      with these Carian or Cretan troops in Judah in the reign of\r      Athaliah (2 Kings xi. 4, 19).\r \r The Libyans had replaced the Shardana in all the offices they had filled\r and in all the garrison towns they had occupied. The kingdom of Mâraîû\r and Kapur had not survived the defeats which it had suffered from\r Mînephtah and Ramses III., but the Mashaûasha who had founded it still\r kept an active hegemony over their former subjects; hence it was that\r the Egyptians became accustomed to look on all the Libyan tribes as\r branches of the dominant race, and confounded all the immigrants from\r Libya under the common name of Mashaûasha.* Egypt was thus slowly\r flooded by Libyans; it was a gradual invasion, which succeeded by\r pacific means where brute force had failed. A Berber population\r gradually took possession of the country, occupying the eastern\r provinces of the Delta, filling its towns--Sais, Damanhur, and\r Marea--making its way into the Fayum, the suburbs of Heracleopolis, and\r penetrating as far south as Abydos; at the latter place they were not\r found in such great numbers, but still considerable enough to leave\r distinct traces.** The high priests of Amon seem to have been the\r only personages who neglected to employ this ubiquitous race; but they\r preferred to use the Nubian tribe of the Mâzaîû,*** who probably from\r the XIIth dynasty onwards had constituted the police force of Thebes.\r \r      * Ramses III. still distinguished between the Qahaka, the\r      Tihonû, and the Mashaûasha; the monuments of the XXIInd\r      dynasty only recognise the Mashaiiasha, whose name they\r      curtail to Ma.\r \r      ** The presence in those regions of persons bearing Asiatic\r      names has been remarked, without drawing thence any proof\r      for the existence of Asiatic colonies in those regions. The\r      presence of Libyans at Abydos seems to be proved by the\r      discovery in that town of the little monument reproduced on\r      the next page, and of many objects in the same style, many\r      of which are in the Louvre or the British Museum.\r \r      *** I have not discovered among the personal attendants of\r      the descendants of Hrihor any functionary bearing the title\r      of _Chief of the Mashaiuasha _; even those who bore it later\r      on, under the XXIInd dynasty, were always officers from\r      the north of Egypt. It seems almost certain that Thebes\r      always avoided having Libyan troops, and never received a\r      Mashaûasha settlement.\r \r These Libyan immigrants had adopted the arts of Egypt and the externals\r of her civilization; they sculptured rude figures on the rocks and\r engraved scenes on their stone vessels, in which they are represented\r fully armed,* and taking part in some skirmish or attack, or even a\r chase in the desert. The hunters are divided into two groups, each of\r which is preceded by a different ensign--that of the West for the right\r wing of the troop, and that of the East for the left wing. They carry\r the spear the boomerang, the club, the double-curved bow, and the\r dart; a foxs skin depends from their belts over their thighs, and an\r ostrichs feather waves above their curly hair.\r \r      * I attribute to the Libyans, whether mercenaries or tribes\r      hovering on the Egyptian frontier, the figures cut\r      everywhere on the rocks, which no one up till now has\r      reproduced or studied. To them I attribute also the tombs\r      which Mr. Petrie has so successfully explored, and in which\r      he finds the remains of a New Race which seems to have\r      conquered Egypt after the VIth dynasty: they appear to be of\r      different periods, but all belong to the Berber horsemen of\r      the desert and the outskirts of the Nile valley.\r \r [Illustration: 410.jpg A TROOP OF LIBYANS HUNTING]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the original in the Louvre.\r \r They never abandoned this special head-dress and manner of arming\r themselves, and they can always be recognised on the monuments by the\r plumes surmounting their forehead.*\r \r      * This design is generally thought to represent a piece of\r      cloth folded in two, and laid flat on the head; examination\r      of the monuments proves that it is the ostrich plume fixed\r      at the back of the head, and laid flat on the hair or wig.\r \r Their settlement on the banks of the Nile and intermarriage with the\r Egyptians had no deteriorating effect on them, as had been the case\r with the Shardana, and they preserved nearly all their national\r characteristics. If here and there some of them became assimilated with\r the natives, there was always a constant influx of new comers, full\r of energy and vigour, who kept the race from becoming enfeebled. The\r attractions of high pay and the prospect of a free-and-easy life drew\r them to the service of the feudal lords. The Pharaoh entrusted their\r chiefs with confidential offices about his person, and placed the\r royal princes at their head. The position at length attained by these\r Mashaûasha was analogous to that of the Oossasans at Babylon, and,\r indeed, was merely the usual sequel of permitting a foreign militia\r to surround an Oriental monarch; they became the masters of their\r sovereigns. Some of their generals went so far as to attempt to use the\r soldiery to overturn the native dynasty, and place themselves upon the\r throne; others sought to make and unmake kings to suit their own taste.\r The earlier Tanite sovereigns had hoped to strengthen their authority\r by trusting entirely to the fidelity and gratitude of their guard; the\r later kings became mere puppets in the hands of mercenaries. At length\r a Libyan family arose who, while leaving the externals of power in\r the hands of the native sovereigns, reserved to themselves the actual\r administration, and reduced the kings to the condition of luxurious\r dependence enjoyed by the elder branch of the Ramessides under the rule\r of the high priests of Amon.\r \r There was at Bubastis, towards the middle or end of the XXth dynasty,\r a Tihonû named Buîuwa-buîuwa. He was undoubtedly a soldier of fortune,\r without either office or rank, but his descendants prospered and rose to\r important positions among the Mashadasha chiefs: the fourth among these,\r Sheshonq by name, married Mîhtinuôskhît, a princess of the royal line.\r His son, Namarôti, managed to combine with his function of chief of\r the Mashauasha several religious offices, and his grandson, also called\r Sheshonq, had a still more brilliant career. We learn from the monuments\r of the latter that, even before he had ascended the throne, he was\r recognised as king and prince of princes, and had conferred on him the\r command of all the Libyan troops. Officially he was the chief person in\r the state after the sovereign, and had the privilege of holding personal\r intercourse with the gods, Amonrâ included--a right which belonged\r exclusively to the Pharaoh and the Theban high priest. The honours which\r he bestowed upon his dead ancestors were of a remarkable character, and\r included the institution of a liturgical office in connection with his\r father Namarôti, a work which resembles in its sentiments the devotions\r of Bamses II. to the memory of Seti. He succeeded in arranging a\r marriage between his son Osorkon and a princess of the royal line, the\r daughter of Psiûkhânnît II., by which alliance he secured the Tanite\r succession; he obtained as a wife for his second son Aûpûti, the\r priestess of Amon, and thus obtained an indirect influence over the Said\r and Nubia.*\r \r      * The date of the death of Paînotmû II. is fixed at the\r      XVIth year of his reign, according to the inscriptions in\r      the pit at Deîr el-Baharî. This would be the date of the\r      accession of Aûpûti, if Aûpûti succeeded him directly, as I\r      am inclined to believe; but if Psiûkhânnît was his immediate\r      successor, and if Nsbindîdî succeeded Manakhpirri, we must\r      place the accession of Aûpûti some years later.\r \r [Illustration: 413.jpg NSITANIBASHIRU]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by E. Brugsch-Bey.\r \r This priestess was probably a daughter or niece of Paînotmû II., but\r we are unacquainted with her name. The princesses continued to play a\r preponderating part in the transmission of power, and we may assume\r that the lady in question was one of those whose names have come down to\r us--Nsikhonsû, Nsitanî-bashîrû, or Isimkhobîû II., who brought with her\r as a dowry the Bubastite fief. We are at a loss whether to place Aûpûti\r immediately after Paînotmû, or between the ephemeral pontificates of\r a certain Psiûkhannît and a certain Nsbindîdi. His succession imposed\r a very onerous duty upon him. Thebes was going through the agonies of\r famine and misery, and no police supervision in the world could secure\r the treasures stored up in the tombs of a more prosperous age from the\r attacks of a famished people. Arrests, trials, and punishments were\r ineffectual against the violation of the sepulchres, and even the\r royal mummies--including those placed in the chapel of Amenôthes I. by\r previous high priests--were not exempt from outrage. The remains of the\r most glorious of the Pharaohs were reclining in this chapel, forming a\r sort of solemn parliament: here was Saqnunrî Tiuâqni, the last member\r of the XVIIth dynasty; here also were the first of the XVIIIth--Ahmosis,\r Amenôthes I., and the three of the name Thûtmosis, together with the\r favourites of their respective harems--Nofritari, Ahhotpû II., Anhâpû,\r Honittimihû, and Sitkamosis; and, in addition, Ramses I., Seti I.,\r Ramses II. of the XIXth dynasty, Ramses III. and Ramses X. of the XXth\r dynasty. The Servants of the True Place were accustomed to celebrate\r at the appointed periods the necessary rites established in their\r honour. Inspectors, appointed for the purpose by the government,\r determined from time to time the identity of the royal mummies, and\r examined into the condition of their wrappings and coffins: after each\r inspection a report, giving the date and the name of the functionary\r responsible for the examination, was inscribed on the linen or the lid\r covering the bodies. The most of the mummies had suffered considerably\r before they reached the refuge in which they were found. The bodies of\r Sitamon and of the Princess Honittimihû had been completely destroyed,\r and bundles of rags had been substituted for them, so arranged with\r pieces of wood as to resemble human figures. Ramses I., Ramses II., and\r Thûtmosis had been deprived of their original shells, and were found in\r extemporised cases. Hrihors successors, who regarded these sovereigns\r as their legitimate ancestors, had guarded them with watchful care, but\r Aûpûti, who did not feel himself so closely related to these old-world\r Pharaohs, considered, doubtless, this vigilance irksome, and determined\r to locate the mummies in a spot where they would henceforward be secure\r from all attack. A princess of the family of Manakhpirrî--Isimkhobiû, it\r would appear--had prepared a tomb for herself in the rocky cliff which\r bounds the amphitheatre of Deîr el-Baharî on the south. The position\r lent itself readily to concealment. It consisted of a well some 130 feet\r deep, with a passage running out of it at right angles for a distance of\r some 200 feet and ending in a low, oblong, roughly cut chamber, lacking\r both ornament and paintings. Paînotmû II. had been placed within this\r chamber in the XVIth year of the reign of Psiûkhannît II., and several\r members of his family had been placed beside him not long afterwards.\r Aûpûti soon transferred thither the batch of mummies which, in the\r chapel of Amenôthes I., had been awaiting a more definite sepulture; the\r coffins, with what remained of their funerary furniture, were huddled\r together in disorder. The chamber having been filled up to the roof, the\r remaining materials, consisting of coffers, boxes of _Ushabti,_ Canopic\r jars, garlands, together with the belongings of priestly mummies, were\r arranged along the passage; when the place was full, the entrance was\r walled up, the well filled, and its opening so dexterously covered that\r it remained concealed until-our own time. The accidental sounding of\r some pillaging Arabs revealed the place as far back as 1872, but it was\r not until ten years later (1881) that the Pharaohs once more saw the\r light. They are now enthroned--who can say for how many years longer?\r --in the chambers of the Gîzeh Museum. Egypt is truly a land of marvels!\r It has not only, like Assyria and Chaldæa, Greece and Italy, preserved\r for us monuments by which its historic past may be reconstructed, but it\r has handed on to us the men themselves who set up the monuments and made\r the history. Her great monarchs are not any longer mere names deprived\r of appropriate forms, and floating colourless and shapeless in the\r imagination of posterity: they may be weighed, touched, and measured;\r the capacity of their brains may be gauged; the curve of their noses and\r the cut of their mouths may be determined; we know if they were bald, or\r if they suffered from some secret infirmity; and, as we are able to do\r in the case of our contemporaries, we may publish their portraits taken\r first hand in the photographic camera. Sheshonq, by assuming the control\r of the Theban priesthood, did not on this account extend his sovereignty\r over Egypt beyond its southern portion, and that part of Nubia\r which still depended on it. Ethiopia remained probably outside his\r jurisdiction, and constituted from this time forward an independent\r kingdom, under the rule of dynasties which were, or claimed to be,\r descendants of Hrihor. The oasis, on the other hand, and the Libyan\r provinces in the neighbourhood of the Delta and the sea, rendered\r obedience to his officers, and furnished him with troops which were\r recognised as among his best. Sheshonq found himself at the death of\r Psiûkhânnît II., which took place about 940 B.C., sole master of Egypt,\r with an effective army and well-replenished treasury at his disposal.\r What better use could he make of his resources than devote them to\r reasserting the traditional authority of his country over Syria? The\r intestine quarrels of the only state of any importance in that region\r furnished him with an opportunity of which he found it easy to take\r advantage. Solomon in his eyes was merely a crowned vassal of Egypt, and\r his appeal for aid to subdue Gezer, his marriage with a daughter of\r the Egyptian royal house, the position he had assigned her over all his\r other wives, and all that we know of the relations between Jerusalem\r and Tanis at the time, seem to indicate that the Hebrews themselves\r acknowledged some sort of dependency upon Egypt. They were not, however,\r on this account free from suspicion in their suzerains eyes, who seized\r upon every pretext that offered itself to cause them embarrassment.\r Hadad, and Jeroboam afterwards, had been well received at the court of\r the Pharaoh, and it was with Egyptian subsidies that these two rebels\r returned to their country, the former in the lifetime of Solomon, and\r the latter after his death. When Jeroboam saw that he was threatened by\r Rehoboam, he naturally turned to his old protectors. Sheshonq had two\r problems before him. Should he confirm by his intervention the division\r of the kingdom, which had flourished in Kharû for now half a century,\r into two rival states, or should he himself give way to the vulgar\r appetite for booty, and step in for his own exclusive interest? He\r invaded Judæa four years after the schism, and Jerusalem offered no\r resistance to him; Rehoboam ransomed his capital by emptying the royal\r treasuries and temple, rendering up even the golden shields which\r Solomon was accustomed to assign to his guards when on duty about his\r person.*\r \r      * 1 Kings xiv. 25-28; cf. 2 Chron. xii. 1-10, where an\r      episode, not in the _Book of Kings_, is introduced. The\r      prophet Shemaiah played an important part in the\r      transaction.\r \r This expedition of the Pharaoh was neither dangerous nor protracted, but\r it was more than two hundred years since so much riches from countries\r beyond the isthmus had been brought into Egypt, and the king was\r consequently regarded by the whole people of the Nile valley as a great\r hero. Aûpûti took upon himself the task of recording the exploit on the\r south wall of the temple of Amon at Karnak, not far from the spot where\r Ramses II. had had engraved the incidents of his Syrian campaigns. His\r architect was sent to Silsilis to procure the necessary sandstone to\r repair the monument. He depicted upon it his father receiving at the\r hands of Amon processions of Jewish prisoners, each one representing a\r captured city. The list makes a brave show, and is remarkable for the\r number of the names composing it: in comparison with those of Thûtmosis\r III., it is disappointing, and one sees at a glance how inferior, even\r in its triumph, the Egypt of the XXIInd dynasty was to that of the\r XVIIIth.\r \r [Illustration: 419.jpg AMON PRESENTING TO SHESHONQ THE LIST OF THE\r CITIES CAPTURED IN ISRAEL AND JUDAH]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Beato.\r \r It is no longer a question of Carchemish, or Qodshû, or Mitanni,\r or Naharaim: Megiddo is the most northern point mentioned, and the\r localities enumerated bring us more and more to the south--Eabbat,\r Taânach, Hapharaîm, Mahanaîm,* Gibeon, Beth-horon, Ajalon, Jud-hammelek,\r Migdol, Jerza, Shoko, and the villages of the Negeb. Each locality,\r in consequence of the cataloguing of obscure towns, furnished enough\r material to cover two, or even three of the crenellated cartouches in\r which the names of the conquered peoples are enclosed, and Sheshonq\r had thus the puerile satisfaction of parading before the eyes of\r his subjects a longer _cortege_ of defeated chiefs than that of his\r predecessor. His victorious career did not last long: he died shortly\r after, and his son Osorkon was content to assume at a distance authority\r over the Kharu.**\r \r      * The existence of the names of certain Israelite towns on\r      the list of. Sheshonq has somewhat astonished the majority\r      of the historians of Israel. Renan declared that the list\r      must put aside the conjecture that Jeroboam had been the\r      instigator of the expedition, which would certainly have\r      been readily admissible, especially if any force were\r      attached to the Greek text of 1 Kings xii. 24, which makes\r      Jeroboam to have been a son-in-law of the King of Egypt;\r       the same view had been already expressed by Stade; others\r      have thought that Sheshonq had conquered the country for his\r      ally Jeroboam. Sheshonq, in fact, was following the Egyptian\r      custom by which all countries and towns which paid tribute\r      to the Pharaoh, or who recognised his suzerainty, were made\r      to, or might, figure on his triumphal lists whether they had\r      been conquered or not: the presence of Megiddo or Mahanaim\r      on the lists does not prove that they were _conquered_ by\r      Sheshonq, but that the prince to whom they owed allegiance\r      was a tributary to the King of Egypt. The name of Jud-ham-\r      melek, which occupies the twenty-ninth place on the list,\r      was for a long time translated as king or kingdom of Judah,\r      and passed for being a portrait of Rehoboam, which is\r      impossible. The Hebrew name was read by W. Max Millier Jad-\r      ham-meleh, the hand, the fort of the king. It appears to me\r      to be more easy to see in it Jud-liam-meleh and to associate\r      it with Jehudah, a town of the tribe of Dan, as Brugsch did\r      long ago.\r \r      ** Champollion identified Osorkon I. with the Zerah, who,\r      according to 2 Chron. xiv. 9-15, xvi. 8, invaded Judah and\r      was defeated by Asa, but this has no historic value, for it\r      is clear that Osorkon never crossed the isthmus.\r \r It does not appear, however, that either the Philistines, or Judah,\r or Israel, or any of the petty tribes which had momentarily gravitated\r around David and Solomon, were disposed to dispute Osorkons claim,\r theoretic rather than real as it was. The sword of the stranger had\r finished the work which the intestine quarrel of the tribes had\r begun. If Rehoboam had ever formed the project of welding together the\r disintegrated elements of Israel, the taking of Jerusalem must have been\r a death-blow to his hopes. His arsenals were empty, his treasury at low\r ebb, and the prestige purchased by Davids victories was effaced by\r the humiliation of his own defeat. The ease with which the edifice so\r laboriously constructed by the heroes of Benjamin and Judah had been\r overturned at the first shock, was a proof that the new possessors of\r Canaan were as little capable of barring the way to Egypt in her old\r age, as their predecessors had been when she was in her youth and\r vigour. The Philistines had had their day; it seemed by no means\r improbable at one time that they were about to sweep everything before\r them, from the Negeb to the Orontes, but their peculiar position in the\r furthest angle of the country, and their numerical weakness, prevented\r them from continuing their efforts for a prolonged period, and they were\r at length obliged to renounce in favour of the Hebrews their ambitious\r pretensions. The latter, who had been making steady progress for some\r half a century, had been successful where the Philistines had signally\r failed, and Southern Syria recognised their supremacy for the space of\r two generations. We can only conjecture what they might have done if a\r second David had led them into the valleys of the Orontes and Euphrates.\r They were stronger in numbers than their possible opponents, and their\r troops, strengthened by mercenary guards, would have perhaps triumphed\r over the more skilled but fewer warriors which the Amorite and Aramaean\r cities could throw into the field against them. The pacific reign\r of Solomon, the schism among the tribes, and the Egyptian invasion\r furnished evidence enough that they also were not destined to realise\r that solidarity which alone could secure them against the great Oriental\r empires when the day of attack came.\r \r The two kingdoms were then enjoying an independent existence. Judah, in\r spite of its smaller numbers and its recent disaster, was not far\r behind the more extensive Israel in its resources. David, and afterwards\r Solomon, had so kneaded together the various elements of which it was\r composed--Caleb, Cain, Jerahmeel and the Judsean clans--that they had\r become a homogeneous mass, grouped around the capital and its splendid\r sanctuary, and actuated with feelings of profound admiration and strong\r fidelity for the family which had made them what they were. Misfortune\r had not chilled their zeal: they rallied round Rehoboam and his race\r with such a persistency that they were enabled to maintain their ground\r when their richer rivals had squandered their energies and fallen\r away before their eyes. Jeroboam, indeed, and his successors had never\r obtained from their people more than a precarious support and a lukewarm\r devotion: their authority was continually coming into conflict with\r a tendency to disintegration among the tribes, and they could only\r maintain their rule by the constant employment of force. Jeroboam had\r collected together from the garrisons scattered throughout the country\r the nucleus of an army, and had stationed the strongest of these\r troops in his residence at Tirzah when he did not require them for some\r expedition against Judah or the Philistines. His successors followed\r his example in this respect, but this military resource was only an\r ineffectual protection against the dangers which beset them. The kings\r were literally at the mercy of their guard, and their reign was entirely\r dependent on its loyalty or caprice: any unscrupulous upstart might\r succeed in suborning his comrades, and the stroke of a dagger might\r at any moment send the sovereign to join his ancestors, while the\r successful rebel reigned in his stead.* The Egyptian troops had no\r sooner set out on their homeward march, than the two kingdoms began to\r display their respective characteristics. An implacable and truceless\r war broke out between them. The frontier garrisons of the two nations\r fought with each other from one years end to another--carrying off each\r others cattle, massacring one another, burning each others villages\r and leading their inhabitants into slavery.**\r \r      * Among nineteen kings of Israel, eight were assassinated\r      and were replaced by the captains of their guards--Nadab,\r      Elah, Zimri, Joram, Zachariah, Shallum, Pekahiah, and Pekah.\r \r      ** This is what is meant by the Hebrew historians when they\r      say there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the\r      days of his life (1 Kings xv. 6; cf. 2 Ohron. xii. 15), and\r      between Abijam and Jeroboam (1 Kings xv. 7; 2 Ohron. xiii.\r      2), and between Asa and Baasha (1 Kings xv. 16, 32) all\r      their days.\r \r From time to time, when the situation became intolerable, one of the\r kings took the field in person, and began operations by attacking such\r of his enemys strongholds as gave him the most trouble at the time.\r Ramah acquired an unenviable reputation in the course of these early\r conflicts: its position gave it command of the roads terminating in\r Jerusalem, and when it fell into the hands of Israel, the Judæan capital\r was blockaded on this side. The strife for its possession was always\r of a terrible character, and the party which succeeded in establishing\r itself firmly within it was deemed to have obtained a great success.*\r \r      * The campaign of Abijah at Mount Zemaraim (2 Chron. xiii.\r      3-19), in which the foundation of the narrative and the\r      geographical details seem fully historical. See also the\r      campaign of Baasha against Ramah (1 Kings xv. 17-22; cf. 2\r      Chron. xvi. 1-6).\r \r The encounter of the armies did not, however, seem to produce much more\r serious results than those which followed the continual guerilla warfare\r along the frontier: the conqueror had no sooner defeated his enemy\r than he set to work to pillage the country in the vicinity, and, having\r accomplished this, returned promptly to his headquarters with the booty.\r Rehoboam, who had seen something of the magnificence of Solomon, tried\r to perpetuate the tradition of it in his court, as far as his slender\r revenues would permit him. He had eighteen women in his harem, among\r whom figured some of his aunts and cousins. The titular queen was\r Maacah, who was represented as a daughter of Absalom. She was devoted to\r the _asheras_, and the king was not behind his father in his tolerance\r of strange gods; the high places continued to be tolerated by him as\r sites of worship, and even Jerusalem was not free from manifestations\r of such idolatry as was associated with the old Canaanite religion. He\r reigned seventeen years, and was interred in the city of David;* Abijam,\r the eldest son of Maacah, succeeded him, and followed in his evil ways.\r Three years later Asa came to the throne,** no opposition being raised\r to his accession. In Israel matters did not go so smoothly. When\r Jeroboam, after a reign of twenty-two years, was succeeded by his son\r Nadab, about the year 905 B.C., it was soon evident that the instinct\r of loyalty to a particular dynasty had not yet laid any firm hold on the\r ten tribes. The peace between the Philistines and Israel was quite as\r unstable as that between Israel and Judah: an endless guerilla warfare\r was waged on the frontier, Gibbethon being made to play much the same\r part in this region as Ramah had done in regard to Jerusalem. For the\r moment it was in the hands of the Philistines, and in the second year\r of his reign Nadab had gone to lay siege to it in force, when he was\r assassinated in his tent by one of his captains, a certain Baasha,\r son of Ahijah, of the tribe of Issachar: the soldiers proclaimed the\r assassin king, and the people found themselves powerless to reject the\r nominee of the army.***\r \r      * 1 Kings xiv. 22-24; cf. 2 Chron. xi. 18-23, where the\r      details given in addition to those in the Booh of Kings seem\r      to be of undoubted authenticity.\r \r      ** 1 Kings xv. 1-8; cf. 2 Chron. xiii. The Booh of Kings\r      describes his mother as Maacah, the daughter of Absalom (xv.\r      10), which would seem to indicate that he was the brother\r      and not the son of Abijam. The uncertainty on this point is\r      of long standing, for the author of Chronicles makes\r      Abijams mother out in one place to be Micaiah, daughter of\r      Uriel of Gibcah (xiii. 2), and in another (xi. 20) Maacah,\r      daughter of Absalom.\r \r      *** 1 Kings xv. 27-34.\r \r Baasha pressed forward resolutely his campaign against Judah. He seized\r Eamah and fortified it;* and Asa, feeling his incapacity to dislodge him\r unaided, sought to secure an ally. Egypt was too much occupied with its\r own internal dissensions to be able to render any effectual help, but a\r new power, which would profit quite as much as Judah by the overthrow\r of Israel, was beginning to assert itself in the north. Damascus had,\r so far, led an obscure and peaceful existence; it had given way before\r Egypt and Chaldæa whenever the Egyptians or Chaldseans had appeared\r within striking distance, but had refrained from taking any part in the\r disturbances by which Syria was torn asunder. Having been occupied\r by the Amorites, it threw its lot in with theirs, keeping, however,\r sedulously in the background: while the princes of Qodshû waged war\r against the Pharaohs, undismayed by frequent reverses, Damascus did\r not scruple to pay tribute to Thûtmosis III. and his descendants, or to\r enter into friendly relations with them. Meanwhile the Amorites had\r been overthrown, and Qodshû, ruined by the Asiatic invasion, soon\r became little more than an obscure third-rate town;** the Aramaeans made\r themselves masters of Damascus about the XIIth century, and in their\r hands it continued to be, just as in the preceding epochs, a town\r without ambitions and of no great renown.\r \r      * 1 Kings xv. 17; cf. 2 Ghron. xvi. 1.\r \r      ** Qodshû is only once mentioned in the Bible (2 Sam. xxiv.\r      6), in which passage its name, misunderstood by the\r      Massoretic scribe, has been restored from the Septuagint\r      text.\r \r We have seen how the Aramæans, alarmed at the sudden rise of the Hebrew\r dynasty, entered into a coalition against David with the Ammonite\r leaders: Zoba aspired to the chief place among the nations of Central\r Syria, but met with reverses, and its defeat delivered over to the\r Israelites its revolted dependencies in the Haurân and its vicinity,\r such as Maacah, Geshur, and even Damascus itself.* The supremacy was,\r however, shortlived; immediately after the death of David, a chief named\r Rezôn undertook to free them from the yoke of the stranger. He had\r begun his military career under Hada-dezer, King of Zoba: when disaster\r overtook this leader and released him from his allegiance, he collected\r an armed force and fought for his own hand. A lucky stroke made him\r master of Damascus: he proclaimed himself king there, harassed the\r Israelites with impunity during the reign of Solomon, and took over the\r possessions of the kings of Zoba in the valleys of the Litany and the\r Orontes.** The rupture between the houses of Israel and Judah removed\r the only dangerous rival from his path, and Damascus became the\r paramount power in Southern and Central Palestine. While Judah and\r Israel wasted their strength in fratricidal struggles, Tabrimmon,\r and after him Benhadad I., gradually extended their territory in\r Coele-Syria;*** they conquered Hamath, and the desert valleys which\r extend north-eastward in the direction of the Euphrates, and forced a\r number of the Hittite kings to render them homage.\r \r      * Cf. what is said in regard to these events on pp. 351,\r      352, supra.\r \r      ** 1 Kings xi. 23-25. The reading Esron in the Septuagint\r      (1 Kings xi. 23) indicates a form Khezrôn, by which it was\r      sought to replace the traditional reading Rezôn.\r \r      *** Hezion, whom the Jewish writer intercalates before\r      Tabrimmon (1 Kings xv. 18), is probably a corruption of\r      Rezôn; Winckler, relying on the Septuagint variants Azin or\r      Azael (1 Kings xv. 18), proposes to alter Hezion into\r      Hazael, and inserts a certain Hazael I. in this place.\r      Tabrimmon is only mentioned in 1 Kings xv. 18, where he is\r      said to have been the father of Benhadad.\r \r They had concluded an alliance with Jeroboam as soon as he established\r his separate kingdom, and maintained the treaty with his successors,\r Nadab and Baasha. Asa collected all the gold and silver which was\r left in the temple of Jerusalem and in his own palace, and sent it to\r Benhadad, saying, There is a league between me and thee, between thy\r father and my father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver\r and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha, King of Israel, that he may\r depart from me. It would seem that Baasha, in his eagerness to complete\r the fortifications of Ramah, had left his northern frontier undefended.\r Benhadad accepted the proposal and presents of the King of Judah,\r invaded Galilee, seized the cities of Ijôn, Dan, and Abel-beth-Maacah,\r which defended the upper reaches of the Jordan and the Litany, the\r lowlands of Genesareth, and all the land of Naphtali. Baasha hastily\r withdrew from Judah, made terms with Benhadad, and settled down in\r Tirzah for the remainder of his reign;* Asa demolished Eamah, and built\r the strongholds of Gebah and Mizpah from its ruins.** Benhadad retained\r the territory he had acquired, and exercised a nominal sovereignty\r over the two Hebrew kingdoms. Baasha, like Jeroboam, failed to found\r a lasting dynasty; his son Blah met with the same fate at the hands\r of Zimri which he himself had meted out to Nadab. As on the former\r occasion, the army was encamped before Gibbethon, in the country of the\r Philistines, when the tragedy took place.\r \r      * 1 Kings xv. 21, xvi. 6.\r \r      ** 1 Kings xv. 18-22; of. 2 Ghron. xvi. 2-6.\r \r Elah was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, which\r was over the household; Zimri, who was captain of half his chariots,\r  left his post at the front, and assassinated him as he lay intoxicated.\r The whole family of Baasha perished in the subsequent confusion, but\r the assassin only survived by seven days the date of his crime. When the\r troops which he had left behind him in camp heard of what had occurred,\r they refused to accept him as king, and, choosing Omri in his place,\r marched against Tirzah. Zimri, finding it was impossible either to\r win them over to his side or defeat them, set fire to the palace, and\r perished in the flames. His death did not, however, restore peace to\r Israel; while one-half of the tribes approved the choice of the army,\r the other flocked to the standard of Tibni, son of Ginath. War raged\r between the two factions for four years, and was only ended by the\r death--whether natural or violent we do not know--of Tibni and his\r brother Joram.*\r \r      * 1 Kings xvi. 8-22; Joram is not mentioned in the\r      Massoretic text, but his name appears in the Septuagint.\r \r Two dynasties had thus arisen in Israel, and had been swept away by\r revolutionary outbursts, while at Jerusalem the descendants of David\r followed one another in unbroken succession. Asa outlived Nadab by\r eleven years, and we hear nothing of his relations with the neighbouring\r states during the latter part of his reign. We are merely told that his\r zeal in the service of the Lord was greater than had been shown by any\r of his predecessors. He threw down the idols, expelled their priests,\r and persecuted all those who practised the ancient religions. His\r grandmother Maacah had made an abominable image for an asherah; he cut\r it down, and burnt it in the valley of the Kedron, and deposed her\r from the supremacy in the royal household which she had held for\r three generations. He is, therefore, the first of the kings to receive\r favourable mention from the orthodox chroniclers of later times, and it\r is stated that he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, as\r did David his father. * Omri proved a warlike monarch, and his reign,\r though not a long one, was signalised by a decisive crisis in the\r fortunes of Israel.** The northern tribes had, so far, possessed no\r settled capital, Shechem, Penuel, and Tirzah having served in turn as\r residences for the successors of Jeroboam and Baasha. Latterly Tirzah\r had been accorded a preference over its rivals; but Zimri had burnt the\r castle there, and the ease with which it had been taken and retaken was\r not calculated to reassure the head of the new dynasty. Omri turned\r his attention to a site lying a little to the north-west of Shechem and\r Mount Ebal, and at that time partly covered by the hamlet of Shomerôn or\r Shimrôn--our modern Samaria.***\r \r      * 1 Kings xv. 11; cf. 2 Ohron. xiv. 2. It is admitted,\r      however, though without any blame being attached to him,\r      that the high places were not taken away (1 Kings xv. 14;\r      cf. 2 Chron. xv. 17).\r \r      ** The Hebrew writer gives the length of his reign as twelve\r      years (1 Kings xvi. 23). Several historians consider this\r      period too brief, and wish to extend it to twenty-four\r      years; I cannot, however, see that there is, so far, any\r      good reason for doubting the approximate accuracy of the\r      Bible figures.\r \r      *** According to the tradition preserved in 1 Kings xvi. 24,\r      the name of the city comes from Shomer, the man from whom\r      Ahab bought the site.\r \r His choice was a wise and judicious one, as the rapid development of the\r city soon proved. It lay on the brow of a rounded hill, which rose in\r the centre of a wide and deep depression, and was connected by a narrow\r ridge with the surrounding mountains. The valley round it is fertile\r and well watered, and the mountains are cultivated up to their summits;\r throughout the whole of Ephraim it would have been difficult to find\r a site which could compare with it in strength or attractiveness. Omri\r surrounded his city with substantial ramparts; he built a palace for\r himself, and a temple in which was enthroned a golden calf similar to\r those at Dan and Bethel.* A population drawn from other nations besides\r the Israelites flocked into this well-defended stronghold, and Samaria\r soon came to be for Israel what Jerusalem already was for Judah, an\r almost impregnable fortress, in which the sovereign entrenched\r himself, and round which the nation could rally in times of danger.\r His contemporaries fully realised the importance of this move on Omris\r part; his name became inseparably connected in their minds with that of\r Israel. Samaria and the house of Joseph were for them, henceforth, the\r house of Omri, Bît-Omri, and the name still clung to them long after\r Omri had died and his family had become extinct.**\r \r      * Amos viii. 14, where the sin of Samaria, coupled as it is\r      with the life of the god of Dan and the way of Beersheba,\r      can, as Wellhausen points out, only refer to the image of\r      the calf worshipped at Samaria.\r \r      ** Shalmaneser II. even goes so far as to describe Jehu, who\r      exterminated the family of Omri, as _Jaua ahal Khumri_,\r      Jehu, son of Omri.\r \r He gained the supremacy over Judah, and forced several of the\r south-western provinces, which had been in a state of independence since\r the days of Solomon, to acknowledge his rule; he conquered the country\r of Medeba, vanquished Kamoshgad, King of Moab, and imposed on him a\r heavy tribute in sheep and wool.* Against Benhadad in the north-west\r he was less fortunate. He was forced to surrender to him several of the\r cities of Gilead--among others Bamoth-gilead, which commanded the fords\r over the Jabbok and Jordan.**\r \r      * Inscription of Meslia, 11. 5-7; cf. 2 Kings iii. 4.\r \r      ** 1 Kings xx. 34. No names are given in the text, but\r      external evidence proves that they were cities of Persea,\r      and that Ramoth-gilead was one of them.\r \r [Illustration: 432.jpg THE HILL OF SAMARIA]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from photograph No. 2G of the _Palestine\r      Exploration Fund._\r \r He even set apart a special quarter in Samaria for the natives of\r Damascus, where they could ply their trades and worship their gods\r without interference. It was a kind of semi-vassalage, from which he was\r powerless to free himself unaided: he realised this, and looked for help\r from without; he asked and obtained the hand of Jezebel, daughter of\r Bthbaal, King of the Sidonians, for Ahab, his heir. Hiram I., the friend\r of David, had carried the greatness of Tyre to its highest point; after\r his death, the same spirit of discord which divided the Hebrews made its\r appearance in Phoenicia. The royal power was not easily maintained over\r this race of artisans and sailors: Baalbazer, son of Hiram, reigned for\r six years, and his successor, Abdastart, was killed in a riot after a\r still briefer enjoyment of power. We know how strong was the influence\r exercised by foster-mothers in the great families of the Bast; the four\r sons of Abda-starts nurse assassinated their foster-brother, and the\r eldest of them usurped his crown. Supported by the motley crowd of\r slaves and adventurers which filled the harbours of Phoenicia, they\r managed to cling to power for twelve years. Their stupid and brutal\r methods of government produced most disastrous results. A section of the\r aristocracy emigrated to the colonies across the sea and incited them\r to rebellion; had this state of things lasted for any time, the Tyrian\r empire would have been doomed. A revolution led to the removal of the\r usurper and the restoration of the former dynasty, but did not bring\r back to the unfortunate city the tranquillity which it sorely needed.\r The three surviving sons of Baalbezer, Methuastarfc, Astarym, and\r Phelles followed one another on the throne in rapid succession, the\r last-named perishing by the hand of his cousin Ethbaal, after a reign of\r eight months. So far, the Israelites had not attempted to take advantage\r of these dissensions, but there was always the danger lest one of their\r kings, less absorbed than his predecessors in the struggle with Judah,\r might be tempted by the wealth of Phoenicia to lay hands on it. Ethbaal,\r therefore, eagerly accepted the means of averting this danger by an\r alliance with the new dynasty offered to him by Omri.*\r \r      * 1 Kings xvi. 31, where the historian has Hebraicised the\r      Phonician name Ittobaal into Ethbaal, Baal is with\r      him. Izebel or Jezebel seems to be an abbreviated form of\r      some name like Baalezbel.\r \r The presence of a Phonician princess at Samaria seems to have had\r a favourable effect on the city and its inhabitants. The tribes of\r Northern and Central Palestine had, so far, resisted the march of\r material civilization which, since the days of Solomon, had carried\r Judah along with it; they adhered, as a matter of principle, to the rude\r and simple customs of their ancestors. Jezebel, who from her cradle had\r been accustomed to all the luxuries and refinements of the Phoenician\r court, was by no means prepared to dispense with them in her adopted\r country. By their contact with her, the Israelites--at any rate, the\r upper and middle classes of them--acquired a certain degree of polish;\r the royal office assumed a more dignified exterior, and approached more\r nearly the splendours of the other Syrian monarchies, such as those of\r Damascus, Hamath, Sidon, Tyre, and even Judah.\r \r Unfortunately, the effect of this material progress was marred by a\r religious difficulty. Jezebel had been brought up by her father, the\r high priest of the Sidonian Astarte, as a rigid believer in his faith,\r and she begged Ahab to permit her to celebrate openly the worship of her\r national deities. Ere long the Tyrian Baal was installed at Samaria with\r his asherah, and his votaries had their temples and sacred groves to\r worship in: their priests and prophets sat at the kings table. Ahab did\r not reject the God of his ancestors in order to embrace the religion of\r his wife--a reproach which was afterwards laid to his door; he remained\r faithful to Him, and gave the children whom he had by Jezebel names\r compounded with that of Jahveh, such as Ahaziah, Joram, and Athaliah.*\r \r      * 1 Kings xvi. 31-33. Ahaziah and Joram mean respectively\r      whom Jahveh sustaineth, and Jahveh is exalted. Athaliah\r      may possibly be derived from a Phoenician form, _Ailialith\r      or Athlifh,_ into which the name of Jahveh does not enter.\r \r This was not the first instance of such tolerance in the history of the\r Israelites: Solomon had granted a similar liberty of conscience to all\r his foreign wives, and neither Rehoboam nor Abijam had opposed Maacah in\r her devotion to the Canaanitish idols. But the times were changing, and\r the altar of Baal could no longer be placed side by side with that of\r Jahveh without arousing fierce anger and inexorable hatred. Scarce a\r hundred years had elapsed since the rupture between the tribes, and\r already one-half of the people were unable to understand how place could\r be found in the breast of a true Israelite for any other god but Jahveh:\r Jahveh alone was Lord, for none of the deities worshipped by foreign\r races under human or animal shapes could compare with Him in might and\r holiness. From this to the repudiation of all those practices associated\r with exotic deities, such as the use of idols of wood or metal, the\r anointing of isolated boulders or circles of rocks, the offering up of\r prisoners or of the firstborn, was but a step: Asa had already furnished\r an example of rigid devotion in Judah, and there were many in Israel who\r shared his views and desired to imitate him. The opposition to what\r was regarded as apostasy on the part of the king did not come from the\r official priesthood; the sanctuaries at Dan, at Bethel, at Shiloh, and\r at Gilgal were prosperous in spite of Jezebel, and this was enough for\r them. But the influence of the prophets had increased marvellously since\r the rupture between the kingdoms, and at the very beginning of his reign\r Ahab was unwise enough to outrage their sense of justice by one of his\r violent acts: in a transport of rage he had slain a certain Naboth, who\r had refused to let him have his vineyard in order that he might enlarge\r the grounds of the palace he was building for himself at Jezreel.* The\r prophets, as in former times, were divided into schools, the head of\r each being called its father, the members bearing the title of the sons\r of the prophets; they dwelt in a sort of monastery, each having his own\r cell, where they ate together, performed their devotional exercises or\r assembled to listen to the exhortations of their chief prophets:** nor\r did their sacred office prevent them from marrying.***\r \r      * 1 Kings xxi., where the later tradition throws nearly all\r      the blame on Jezebel; whereas in the shorter account, in 2\r      Kings ix. 25, 26, it is laid entirely on Ahab.\r \r      ** In 1 Sam. xix. 20, a passage which seems to some to be a\r      later interpolation, mentions a company of the prophets,\r      prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them. Cf. 2\r      Kings vi. 1-7, where the narrative introduces a congregation\r      of prophets grouped round Elisha.\r \r      *** 2 Kings iv. 1-7, where an account is given of the\r      miracle worked by Elisha on behalf of a woman of the wives\r      of the sons of the prophets.\r \r As a rule, they settled near one of the temples, and lived there on\r excellent terms with the members of the regular priesthood. Accompanied\r by musical instruments, they chanted the songs in which the poets of\r other days extolled the mighty deeds of Jahveh, and obtained from this\r source the incidents of the semi-religious accounts which they narrated\r concerning the early history of the people; or, when the spirit moved\r them, they went about through the land prophesying, either singly, or\r accompanied by a disciple, or in bands.* The people thronged round them\r to listen to their hymns or their stories of the heroic age: the great\r ones of the land, even kings themselves, received visits from them, and\r endured their reproaches or exhortations with mingled feelings of awe\r and terror. A few of the prophets took the part of Ahab and Jezebel,**\r but the majority declared against them, and of these, the most\r conspicuous, by his forcibleness of speech and action, was Elijah. We\r do not know of what race or family he came, nor even what he was:*** the\r incidents of his life which have come down to us seem to be wrapped in a\r vague legendary grandeur. He appears before Ahab, and tells him that\r for years to come no rain or dew shall fall on the earth save by his\r command, and then takes flight into the desert in order to escape the\r kings anger.\r \r      * 1 Sam. x. 5, where a band of prophets is mentioned coming\r      down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and\r      a pipe, and a harp, before them, prophesying; cf. ver. 10.\r      In 2 Kings ii. 3-5, bands of the children of the prophets\r       come out from Bethel and Jericho to ask Elisha if he knows\r      the fate which awaits Elijah on that very day.\r \r      ** Cf. the anonymous prophet who encourages Ahab, in the\r      name of Jahveh, to surprise the camp of Benhadad before\r      Samaria (1 Kings xx. 13-15, 22-25, 28); and the prophet\r      Zedekiah, who gives advice contrary to that of his fellow-\r      prophet Micaiah in the council of war held by Ahab with\r      Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, before the attack on Ramobh-\r      gilead (1 Kings xxii. 11, 12, 24).\r \r      *** The ethnical inscription, Tishbite, which we find\r      after his name (1 Kings xvii. 1, xxi. 17), is due to an\r      error on the part of the copyist.\r \r He is there ministered unto by ravens, which bring him bread and meat\r every night and morning. When the spring from which he drinks dries up,\r he goes to the house of a widow at Zarephath in the country of Sidon,\r and there he lives with his hostess for twelve months on a barrel of\r meal and a cruse of oil which never fail. The widows son dies suddenly:\r he prays to Jahveh and restores him to life; then, still guided by an\r inspiration from above, he again presents himself before the king. Ahab\r receives him without resentment, assembles the prophets of Baal, brings\r them face to face with Elijah on the top of Mount Carmel, and orders\r them to put an end to the drought by which his kingdom is wasted. The\r Phoenicians erect an altar and call upon their Baâlîm with loud cries,\r and gash their arms and bodies with knives, yet cannot bring about\r the miracle expected of them. Elijah, after mocking at their cries and\r contortions, at last addresses a prayer to Jahveh, and fire comes\r down from heaven and consumes the sacrifice in a moment; the people,\r convinced by the miracle, fall upon the idolaters and massacre them, and\r the rain shortly afterwards falls in torrents. After this triumph he is\r said to have fled once more for safety to the desert, and there on Horeb\r to have had a divine vision. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a\r great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks\r before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind\r an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the\r earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the\r fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that He\r wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering\r in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,\r What doest thou here, Elijah? God then commanded him to anoint Hazael\r as King of Syria, and Jehu, son of Nimshi, as King over Israel, and\r Elisha, son of Shaphat, as prophet in his stead, and him that escapeth\r from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the\r sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. The sacred writings go on to tell us\r that the prophet who had held such close converse with the Deity was\r exempt from the ordinary laws of humanity, and was carried to heaven\r in a chariot of fire. The account that has come down to us shows the\r impression of awe left by Elijah on the spirit of his age.*\r \r Ahab was one of the most warlike among the warrior-kings of Israel. He\r ruled Moab with a strong hand,** kept Judah in subjection,*** and in his\r conflict with Damascus experienced alternately victory and honourable\r defeat. Hadadidri [Hadadezer], of whom the Hebrew historians make a\r second Benhadad,**** had succeeded the conqueror of Baasha.^\r \r      * The story of Elijah is found in 1 Kings xvii.-xix., xxi.\r      17-29, and 2 Kings i., ii. 1-14.\r \r      ** Inscription of Mesha, 11. 7, 8.\r \r      *** The subordination of Judah is nowhere explicitly\r      mentioned: it is inferred from the attitude adopted by\r      Jehoshaphat in presence of Ahab (1 Kings xxii. 1, et seq.).\r \r      **** The Assyrian texts call this Dadidri, Adadidri, which\r      exactly corresponds to the Plebrew form Hadadezer.\r \r      ^ The information in the Booh of Kings does not tell us at\r      what time during the reign of Ahab his first wars with\r      Hadadezer (Benhadad II.) and the siege of Samaria occurred.\r      The rapid success of Shalmanesers campaigns against\r      Damascus, between 854 and 839 B.C., does not allow us to\r      place these events after the invasion of Assyria. Ahab\r      appears, in 854, at the battle of Karkar, as the ally of\r      Benhadad, as I shall show later.\r \r The account of his campaigns in the Hebrew records has only reached us\r in a seemingly condensed and distorted condition. Israel, strengthened\r by the exploits of Omri, must have offered him a strenuous resistance,\r but we know nothing of the causes, nor of the opening scenes of the\r drama. When the curtain is lifted, the preliminary conflict is over, and\r the Israelites, closely besieged in Samaria, have no alternative before\r them but unconditional surrender. This was the first serious attack\r the city had sustained, and its resistance spoke well for the military\r foresight of its founder. In Benhadads train were thirty-two kings, and\r horses and chariots innumerable, while his adversary could only\r oppose to them seven thousand men. Ahab was willing to treat, but\r the conditions proposed were so outrageous that he broke off the\r negotiations. We do not know how long the blockade had lasted, when\r one day the garrison made a sortie in full daylight, and fell upon the\r Syrian camp; the enemy were panic-stricken, and Benhadad with difficulty\r escaped on horseback with a handful of men. He resumed hostilities\r in the following year, but instead of engaging the enemy in the\r hill-country of Ephraim, where his superior numbers brought him no\r advantage, he deployed his lines on the plain of Jezreel, near the town\r of Aphek. His servants had counselled him to change his tactics: The\r God of the Hebrews is a God of the hills, therefore they were stronger\r than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we\r shall be stronger than they. The advice, however, proved futile, for he\r sustained on the open plain a still more severe defeat than he had met\r with in the mountains, and the Hebrew historians affirm that he was\r taken prisoner during the pursuit. The power of Damascus was still\r formidable, and the captivity of its king had done little to bring\r the war to an end; Ahab, therefore, did not press his advantage, but\r received the Syrian monarch as a brother, and set him at liberty after\r concluding with him an offensive and defensive alliance. Israel at this\r time recovered possession of some of the cities which had been lost\r under Baasha and Omri, and the Israelites once more enjoyed the right\r to occupy a particular quarter of Damascus. According to the Hebrew\r account, this was the retaliation they took for their previous\r humiliations. It is further stated, in relation to this event, that a\r certain man of the sons of the prophets, speaking by the word of the\r Lord, bade one of his companions smite him. Having received a wound, he\r disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes, and placed himself in\r the kings path, and as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and\r he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold,\r a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man:\r if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or\r else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. And as thy servant was busy here\r and there, he was gone. And the King of Israel said unto him, So shall\r thy judgment be; thyself has decided it. Then he hasted, and took the\r headband away from his eyes, and the King of Israel discerned him that\r he was one of the prophets. And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord,\r Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to\r destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people\r for his people. And the King of Israel went to his house heavy and\r displeased, and came to Samaria. This story was in accordance with the\r popular feeling, and Ahab certainly ought not to have paused till he had\r exterminated his enemy, could he have done so; but was this actually in\r his power?\r \r We have no reason to contest the leading facts in this account, or to\r doubt that Benhadad suffered some reverses before Samaria; but we may\r perhaps ask whether the check was as serious as we are led to believe,\r and whether imagination and national vanity did not exaggerate its\r extent and results. The fortresses of Persea which, according to the\r treaty, ought to have been restored to Israel, remained in the hands of\r the people of Damascus, and the loss of Ramoth-gilead continued to be a\r source of vexation to such of the tribes of Gad and Reuben as followed\r the fortunes of the house of Omri:* yet these places formed the most\r important part of Benhadads ransom.\r \r      * And the King of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye\r      that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not\r      out of the hand of the King of Syria?\r \r The sole effect of Ahabs success was to procure for him more lenient\r treatment; he lost no territory, and perhaps gained a few towns, but he\r had to sign conditions of peace which made him an acknowledged vassal to\r the King of Syria.*\r \r      * No document as yet proves directly that Ahab was vassal to\r      Benhadad II. The fact seems to follow clearly enough from\r      the account of the battle of Karkar against Shalmaneser II.,\r      where the contingent of Ahab of Israel figures among those\r      of the kings who fought for Benhadad II. against the\r      Assyrians.\r \r Damascus still remained the foremost state of Syria, and, if we rightly\r interpret the scanty information we possess, seemed in a fair way to\r bring about that unification of the country which neither Hittites,\r Philistines, nor Hebrews had been able to effect. Situated nearly\r equidistant from Raphia and Carchemish, on the outskirts of the\r cultivated region, the city was protected in the rear by the desert,\r which secured it from invasion on the east and north-east; the dusty\r plains of the Haurân protected it on the south, and the wooded cliffs of\r Anti-Lebanon on the west and north-west. It was entrenched within these\r natural barriers as in a fortress, whence the garrison was able to\r sally forth at will to attack in force one or other of the surrounding\r nations: if the city were victorious, its central position made it easy\r for its rulers to keep watch over and preserve what they had won; if it\r suffered defeat, the surrounding mountains and deserts formed natural\r lines of fortification easy to defend against the pursuing foe, but\r very difficult for the latter to force, and the delay presented by this\r obstacle gave the inhabitants time to organise their reserves and bring\r fresh troops into the field. The kings of Damascus at the outset brought\r under their suzerainty the Aramaean principalities--Argob, Maacah, and\r Geshur, by which they controlled the Haurân, and Zobah, which secured\r to them Coele-Syria from Lake Huleh to the Bahr el-Kades. They had taken\r Upper Galilee from the Hebrews, and subsequently Perasa, as far as the\r Jabbok, and held in check Israel and the smaller states, Amnion and\r Moab, which followed in its wake. They exacted tribute from Hamath, the\r Phoenician Arvad, the lower valley of the Orontes, and from a portion\r of the Hittites, and demanded contingents from their princes in time\r of war. Their power was still in its infancy, and its elements were not\r firmly welded together, but the surrounding peoples were in such a\r state of weakness and disunion that they might be left out of account as\r formidable enemies. The only danger that menaced the rising kingdom was\r the possibility that the two ancient warlike nations, Egypt and Assyria,\r might shake off their torpor, and reappearing on the scene of their\r former prowess might attack her before she had consolidated her power by\r the annexation of Naharaim.\r \r END OF VOL.

identified by Brugsch\r      with the hamlet of Deîr el-Medineh: the founder of the\r      temple was none other than Amenôthes, who was minister under\r      Amenôthes III.", "[Illustration: 004.jpg THE THEBAN CEMETERIES]\r \r Each of these temples had around it its enclosing wall of dried brick,\r and the collection of buildings within this boundary formed the Khîrû,\r or retreat of some one of

used as a prison if occasion required.*\r \r      * This was the hliatmû, the dungeon, frequently mentioned in\r      the documents bearing upon the necropolis.", "The remaining buildings consisted of

us.", "The first service was that of mummification, which\r necessitated numbers of workers for its accomplishment.", "Some of the\r workshops of the embalmers have been discovered from time to time at\r Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh and Deîr el-Baharî, but we are still in ignorance\r as to their arrangements, and as to the exact nature of the materials\r which they employed.", "A considerable superficial space was required, for\r the manipulations of the embalmers occupied usually from sixty to eighty\r days, and if we suppose that the average deaths at Thebes amounted to\r fifteen or twenty in the twenty-four hours, they would have to provide\r at the same time for the various degrees of saturation of some twelve to\r fifteen hundred bodies at the least.**\r \r      * The discovery of

heart from the time he was upon the earth, from rising\r up and witnessing against the dead man before the tribunal of Osiris.*\r There were placed on his fingers gold or enamelled rings, as

hand, still preserves, where the operations have been properly\r conducted, its natural form.", "The cheeks have fallen in slightly, the\r lips and the fleshy parts of the nose have become thinner and

the size of the head to twofold\r its ordinary bulk.", "The trunk and limbs were bound round with a first\r covering of some pliable soft stuff, warm to the touch.", "Coarsely\r powdered natron was scattered here and there over the body as an\r additional preservative.", "Packets placed between the legs, the arms and\r the hips, and in the eviscerated abdomen, contained the heart, spleen,\r the dried brain, the hair, and the cuttings of the beard and nails.", "In\r those days the hair had a special magical virtue: by burning it while\r uttering certain incantations, one might acquire an almost limitless\r power over the person to whom it had belonged.", "The ernbalmers,\r therefore, took care to place with the mummy such portions of the hair\r as they had been obliged to cut off, so as to remove them out of the way\r of the perverse ingenuity of the sorcerers.", "[Illustration: 009.jpg WRAPPING OF THE MUMMY, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE\r MAN OF THE ROLL]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Rosellini.", "Over the first covering of the mummy already alluded to, there was\r sometimes placed a strip of papyrus or a long piece of linen, upon which\r the scribe had transcribed selections--both text and pictures--from The\r Book of the going forth by Day: in such cases the roll containing the\r whole work was placed between the legs.", "The body was further wrapped in\r several bandages, then in a second piece of stuff, then in more bands,\r the whole being finally covered with a shroud of coarse canvas and a\r red linen winding-sheet, sewn together at the back, and kept in place by\r transverse bands disposed at intervals from head to foot.", "The son of the\r deceased and a man of the roll were present at this lugubrious toilet,\r and recited at the application of each piece a prayer, in which its\r object was defined and its duration secured.", "Every Egyptian was supposed\r to be acquainted with the formulas, from having learned them during his\r lifetime, by which he was to have restored to him the use of his limbs,\r and be protected from the dangers of the world beyond.", "These were\r repeated to the dead person, however, for greater security, during the\r process of embalming, and the son of the deceased, or the master of the\r ceremonies, took care to whisper to the mummy the most mysterious parts,\r which no living ear might hear with impunity.", "The wrappings having\r been completed, the deceased person became aware of his equipment, and\r enjoyed all the privileges of the instructed and fortified Manes. He\r felt himself, both mummy and double, now ready for the tomb.", "Egyptian funerals were not like those to which we are accustomed--mute\r ceremonies, in which sorrow is barely expressed by a furtive tear:\r noise, sobbings, and wild gestures were their necessary concomitants.", "Not only was it customary to hire weeping women, who tore their hair,\r filled the air with their lamentations, and simulated by skilful actions\r the depths of despair, but the relatives and friends themselves did not\r shrink from making an outward show of their grief, nor from disturbing\r the equanimity of the passers-by by the immoderate expressions of their\r sorrow.", "One after another they raised their voices, and uttered some\r expression appropriate to the occasion: To the West, the dwelling of\r Osiris, to the West, thou who wast the best of men, and who always hated\r guile. And the hired weepers answered in chorus: O chief,* as thou\r goest to the West, the gods themselves lament. The funeral _cortege_\r started in the morning from the house of mourning, and proceeded at a\r slow pace to the Nile, amid the clamours of the mourners.", "* The chief is one of the names of Osiris, and is applied\r      naturally to the dead person, who has become an Osiris by\r      virtue of the embalming.", "The route was cleared by a number of slaves and retainers.", "First came\r those who carried cakes and flowers in their hands, followed by others\r bearing jars full of water, bottles of liqueurs, and phials of perfumes;\r then came those who carried painted boxes intended for the provisions\r of the dead man, and for containing the Ushabtiu, or Respondents. The\r succeeding group bore the usual furniture required by the deceased\r to set up house again, coffers for linen, folding and arm chairs,\r state-beds, and sometimes even a caparisoned chariot with its quivers.", "Then came a groom conducting two of his late masters favourite horses,\r who, having accompanied the funeral to the tomb, were brought back\r to their stable.", "Another detachment, more numerous than the others\r combined, now filed past, bearing the effects of the mummy; first the\r vessels for the libations, then the cases for the Canopic jars, then the\r Canopic jars themselves, the mask of the deceased, coloured half in gold\r and half in blue, arms, sceptres, military batons, necklaces, scarabs,\r vultures with encircling wings worn on the breast at festival-times,\r chains, Respondents, and the human-headed sparrow-hawk, the emblem of\r the soul.", "Many of these objects were of wood plated with gold, others\r of the same material simply gilt, and others of solid gold, and thus\r calculated to excite the cupidity of the crowd.", "Offerings came next,\r then a noisy company of female weepers; then a slave, who sprinkled at\r every instant some milk upon the ground as if to lay the dust; then\r a master of the ceremonies, who, the panther skin upon his shoulder,\r asperged the crowd with perfumed water; and behind him comes the hearse.", "[Illustration: 012.jpg THE FUNERAL OF HARMHABI]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after a coloured print in Wilkinson.", "The cut on the following page joins this on the right.", "The latter, according to custom, was made in the form of a\r boat--representing the bark of Osiris, with his ark, and two guardians,\r Isis and Nephthys--and was placed upon a sledge, which was drawn by a\r team of oxen and a relay of fellahîn.", "The sides of the ark were, as\r a rule, formed of movable wooden panels, decorated with pictures and\r inscriptions; sometimes, however, but more rarely, the panels were\r replaced by a covering of embroidered stuff or of soft leather.", "In\r the latter case the decoration was singularly rich, the figures and\r hieroglyphs being cut out with a knife, and the spaces thus left filled\r in with pieces of coloured leather, which gave the whole an appearance\r of brilliant mosaic-work.*\r \r      * One of these coverings was found in the hiding-place at\r      Deîr el-Baharî; it had belonged to the Princess Isîmkhobiû,\r      whose mummy is now at Gîzeh.", "[Illustration: 013.jpg THE FUNERAL

Nofirhotpû at Thebes.", "This lamentation is neither remarkable for its originality nor for its\r depth of feeling.", "Sorrow was expressed on such occasions in prescribed\r formulas of always the same import, custom soon enabling each individual\r to compose for himself a repertory of monotonous exclamations of\r condolence, of which the prayer, To the West! formed the basis,\r relieved at intervals by some fresh epithet.", "The nearest relatives\r of the deceased, however, would find some more sincere expressions of\r grief, and some more touching appeals with which to break in upon

relative proportions of the parts\r alone were modified: the mastaba, which had gradually been reduced to\r an insignificant base, had now recovered its original height, while the\r pyramid had correspondingly decreased, and was much reduced in size.", "The\r chapel was constructed within the building, and the mummy-pit was sunk\r to a varying depth below.", "The tombs ranged along the

house which is\r in the funeral valley when the morning for the hiding away of their body\r should come. Access to these tombs was by too steep and difficult a\r path to allow of oxen being employed for the transport of the mummy: the\r friends or slaves of the deceased were, therefore, obliged to raise the\r sarcophagus on their shoulders and bear it as best they could to the\r door of the tomb.", "[Illustration: 019.jpg THE FAREWELL TO THE MUMMY, AND THE DOUBLE\r RECEIVED BY THE GODDESS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the paintings in the Theban\r      tombs.", "The mummy was

their cries and threw\r themselves upon the ground, the relatives decked the mummy with flowers\r and pressed it to their bared bosoms, kissing it upon the breast and\r knees.", "I am thy sister, O

who lovedst to jest with me, thou art now silent, thou speakest\r not! Whereupon the mourners again broke out in chorus: Lamentation,\r lamentation!", "Make, make, make, make lamentation without

land which bringest isolation!", "Thou who\r lovedst to stretch thy limbs in walking, art now fettered, bound,\r swathed!", "Thou who hadst fine stuffs in abundance, art laid in the linen\r of yesterday! Calm in the midst of the tumult, the priest stood and\r offered the incense and libation with the accustomed words: To thy\r double, Osiris Nofirhotpû, whose voice before the great god is true!\r  This was the signal of departure, and the mummy, carried by two men,\r disappeared within the tomb: the darkness of the other world had laid\r hold of it, never to let it go again.", "The chapel was usually divided into two chambers: one, which was of\r greater width than length, ran parallel to the façade; the other, which\r was longer than it was wide, stood at right angles with the former,\r exactly opposite to the entrance.", "The decoration of these chambers\r took its inspiration from the scheme which prevailed in the time of the\r Memphite dynasties, but besides the usual scenes of agricultural labour,\r hunting, and sacrifice, there were introduced episodes from the public\r life of the deceased, and particularly the minute portrayal of the\r ceremonies connected with his burial.", "[Illustration: 021.jpg NICHE IN THE TOMB OF MENNA]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.", "These pictorial biographies are always accompanied by detailed\r explanatory inscriptions; every individual endeavoured thus to show\r to the Osirian judges the rank he had enjoyed here upon earth, and to\r obtain in the fields of lalû the place which he claimed to be his due.", "The stele was to be found at the far end of the second chamber; it was\r often let in to a niche in the form of a round-headed doorway, or else\r it was replaced by a group of statues, either detached or sculptured in\r the rock itself, representing the occupant, his wives and children, who\r took the place of the supporters of the double, formerly always hidden\r within the serdab.", "The ceremony of the Opening of the Mouth took\r place in front of the niche on the day of burial, at the moment when the\r deceased, having completed his terrestrial course, entered his new home\r and took possession of it for all eternity.", "The object of this ceremony\r was, as we know, to counteract the effects of the embalming, and to\r restore activity to the organs of the body whose functions had been\r suspended by death.", "The man of the roll and his assistants, aided by\r the priests, who represented the children of Horus, once more raised\r the mummy into an upright position upon a heap of sand in the middle of\r the chapel, and celebrated in his behalf the divine mystery instituted\r by Horus for Osiris.", "They purified it both by ordinary and by red water,\r by the incense of the south and by the alum of the north, in the same\r manner as that in which the statues of the gods were purified at the\r beginning of the temple sacrifices; they then set to work to awake the\r deceased from his sleep: they loosened his shroud and called back the\r double who had escaped from the body at the moment of the death-agony,\r and restored to him the use of his arms and legs.", "As soon as the\r sacrificial slaughterers had despatched the bull of the south, and cut\r it in pieces, the priest seized the bleeding haunch, and raised it\r to the lips of the mask as if to invite it to eat; but the lips still\r remained closed, and refused to perform their office.", "The priest then\r touched them with several iron instruments hafted on wooden handles,\r which were supposed to possess the power of unsealing them.", "[Illustration: 023a.jpg COFFIN-LID]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by M.", "de Mertens.", "[Illustration: 023b.jpg COFFIN-LID]\r \r The opening once effected, the double became free, and the\r tomb-paintings from thenceforward ceasing to depict the mummy,\r represented the double only.", "They portrayed it under the form which he\r had on this earth, wearing the civil garb, and fulfilling his ordinary\r functions.", "The corpse was regarded as merely the larva, to be maintained\r in its integrity in order to ensure survival; but it could be relegated\r without fear to the depths of the bare and naked tomb, there to remain\r until the end of time, if it pleased the gods to preserve it from\r robbers or archaeologists.", "At the period of the first Theban empire\r the coffins were rectangular wooden chests, made on the models of the\r limestone and granite sarcophagi, and covered with prayers taken from\r the various sacred writings, especially from the Book of the Dead;\r during the second Theban empire, they were modified into an actual\r sheath for the body, following more or less the contour of the human\r figure.", "This external model of the deceased covered his remains, and\r his figure in relief served as a lid to the coffin.", "The head was covered\r with the full-dress wig, a tippet of white cambrio half veiled the\r bosom, the petticoat fell in folds about the limbs, the feet were shod\r with sandals, the arms were outstretched or were folded over the breast,\r and the hands clasped various objects--either the _crux ansata_, the\r buckle of the belt, the _tat_, or a garland of flowers.", "Sometimes, on\r the contrary, the coffin was merely a conventional reproduction of\r the human form.", "The two feet and legs were joined together, and the\r modelling of the knee, calf, thigh, and stomach was only slightly\r indicated in the wood.", "Towards the close of the XVIIIth dynasty it was\r the fashion for wealthy persons to have two coffins, one fitting inside\r the other, painted black or white.", "From the XXth dynasty onwards they\r were coated with a yellowish varnish, and so covered with inscriptions\r and mystic signs that each coffin was a tomb in miniature, and could\r well have done duty as such, and thus meet all the needs of the soul.*\r \r      * The first to summarise the characteristics of the coffins\r      and sarcophagi of the second Theban period was Mariette, but\r      he places the use of the yellow-varnished coffins too late,\r      viz.", "during the XXIInd dynasty.", "Examples of them have since\r      been found which incontestably belong to the XXth.", "[Illustration: 024.jpg THE MUMMY FACTORY]\r \r Later still, during the XXIst and XXIInd dynasties, these two, or even\r three coffins, were enclosed in a rectangular sarcophagus of thick wood,\r which, surmounted by a semicircular lid, was decorated with pictures and\r hallowed by prayers: four sparrow-hawks, perched on the uprights at the\r corners, watched at the four cardinal points, and protected the body,\r enabling the soul at the same time to move freely within the four houses\r of which the world was composed.", "[Illustration: 025.jpg THE PARAPHERNALIA OF A MUMMY OF THE XXth TO THE\r XXIInd DYNASTIES]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Mariette.", "The workmen, after having deposited the mummy in its resting-place,\r piled upon the floor of the tomb the canopio jars, the caskets, the\r provisions, the furniture, the bed, and the stools and chairs; the\r Usha-btiu occupied compartments in their allotted boxes, and sometimes\r there would be laid beside them the mummy of a favourite animal--a\r monkey, a dog of some rare breed, or a pet gazelle, whose coffins were\r shaped to their respective outlines, the better to place before the\r deceased the presentment of the living animal.", "[Illustration: 026.jpg THE FUNERAL REPAST--MUSIC AND DANCING]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a fragment in the British\r      Museum.", "The scene representing the funeral repast and its\r      accompanying dances occurs frequently in the Theban tombs.", "A few of the principal objects were broken or damaged, in the belief\r that, by thus destroying them, their doubles would go forth and\r accompany the human double, and render him their accustomed services\r during the whole of his posthumous existence; a charm pronounced over\r them bound them indissolubly to his person, and constrained them to obey\r his will.", "This done, the priest muttered a final prayer, and the masons\r walled up the doorway.", "[Illustration: 027.jpg THE COFFIN OF THE FAVOURITE GAZELLE OF\r ISÎMKHOBIU]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-\r      Bey.", "The funeral feast now took place with its customary songs and dances.", "The _almehs_ addressed the guests and exhorted them to make good use of\r the passing hour: Be happy for one day!", "for when you enter your tombs\r you will rest there eternally throughout the length of every day!\r \r Immediately after the repast the friends departed from the tomb, and the\r last link which connected the dead with our world was then broken.", "The\r sacred harper was called upon to raise the farewell hymn:*\r \r      * The harper is often represented performing this last\r      office.", "In the tomb of Nofirhotpû, and in many others, the\r      daughters or the relatives of the deceased accompany or even\r      replace the harper; in this case they belonged to a priestly\r      family, and fulfilled the duties of the Female Singers of\r      Amon or some other god.", "O instructed mummies, ennead of the gods of the coffin, who listen to\r the praises of this dead man, and who daily extol the virtues of this\r instructed mummy, who is living eternally like a god, ruling in Amentît,\r ye also who shall live in the memory of posterity, all ye who shall\r come and read these hymns inscribed, according to the rites, within\r the tombs, repeat: The greatness of the under-world, what is it?", "The\r annihilation of the tomb, why is it? It is to conform to the image\r of the land of Eternity, the true country where there is no strife and\r where violence is held in abhorrence, where none attacks his neighbour,\r and where none among our generations who rest within it is rebellious,\r from the time when your race first existed, to the moment when it shall\r become a multitude of multitudes, all going the same way; for instead\r of remaining in this land of Egypt, there is not one but shall leave it,\r and there is said to all who are here below, from the moment of their\r waking to life: Go, prosper safe and sound, to reach the tomb at\r length, a chief among the blessed, and ever mindful in thy heart of the\r day when thou must lie down on the funeral bed! The ancient song\r of Antûf, modified in the course of centuries, was still that which\r expressed most forcibly the melancholy thought paramount in the minds of\r the friends assembled to perform the last rites.", "The impassibility of\r the chief* is, in truth, the best of fates!\r \r      * Osiris is here designated by the word chief, as I have\r      already pointed out.", "[Illustration: 029.jpg ONE OF THE HARPERS OF THE TOMB

and even then he did not reach the lowest of the\r      pile.", "The hurried excavations which I made in 1882 and 1884,\r      appeared to confirm these statements of Rhind and Vassalli.", "Yawning trenches stood ever open there, ready to receive their prey;\r the rites were hurriedly performed, and the grave-diggers covered the\r mummies of the days burial with a little sand, out of which we receive\r them intact, sometimes isolated, sometimes in groups of twos or threes,\r showing that they had not even been placed in regular layers.", "Some\r are wrapped only in bandages of coarse

came to hand, with a total indifference as to suitability of size;\r others lie in a badly made bier, made up of the fragments of one or more\r older biers.", "None of them possessed any funerary furniture, except the\r tools of his trade, a thin pair of leather shoes, sandals of cardboard\r or plaited reeds, rings of terra-cotta or bronze, bracelets or necklets\r of a single row of blue beads, statuettes of divinities, mystic eyes,\r scarabs, and, above all, cords tied round the neck, arms, limbs, or\r waist, to keep off, by their mystic knots, all malign influences.", "The whole population of the necropolis made their living out of the\r dead.", "This was true of all ranks of society, headed by the sacerdotal\r colleges of the royal chapels,* and followed by the priestly bodies, to\r whom was entrusted the care of the tombs in the various sections,\r but the most influential of whom confined their attentions to the old\r burying-ground, Isît-mâît, the True

a battle in those distant days.", "The sculptor of statues for a long time past was not a whit less skilful\r than the artist who executed bas-reliefs.", "The sculptor was doubtless\r often obliged to give enormous proportions to the figure of the king, to\r prevent his being overshadowed by the mass of buildings among which the\r statue was to appear; but this necessity of exaggerating the human form\r did not destroy in the artist that sense of proportion and that skilful\r handling of the chisel which are so strikingly displayed in the sitting\r scribe or in the princess at Meîdûm; it merely trained him to mark out\r deftly the principal lines, and to calculate the volume and dimensions\r of these gigantic granite figures of some fifty to sixty-five feet high,\r with as great confidence and skill as he would have employed upon any\r statue of ordinary dimensions which might be entrusted to him.", "The colossal statues at Abu-Simbel and Thebes still witness to the\r incomparable skill of the Theban sculptors in the difficult art of\r imagining and executing superhuman types.", "The decadence of Egyptian art\r did not begin until the time of Ramses III., but its downward progress\r was rapid, and the statues of the Ramesside period are of little or no\r artistic value.", "The form of these figures is poor, the technique crude,\r and the expression of the

on that account become more prudent, and the hours of labour lost did\r not decrease.", "The individual man, if he had had nobody to consider but\r himself, might have put up with the hardships of his

him, and begged that he might escape the punishment fixed by the law\r for blasphemy; the scribe, good fellow as he was, closed his ears to the\r oath, and, if it were in his power, made a beginning of satisfying their\r demands by drawing upon the excess of past months to such an extent as\r would pacify them for some days, and by paying them a supplemental wage\r in the name of the Pharaoh.", "They cried out loudly: Shall there not be\r served out to us corn in excess of that which has been distributed to\r us; if not we will not stir from this spot?\r \r At length the end of the month

town, and they said to him: See to the corn which thou\r hast received, and give some of it to the people of the necropolis.\r  Pmontunîboîsît was then sent for, and rations of wheat were given to\r us daily. Famine was not caused only by the thriftlessness of the\r multitude: administrators of all ranks did not hesitate to appropriate,\r each one according to his position, a portion of the

condemned.", "What took place at Thebes was repeated with some variations\r in each of the other large cities.", "Corruption, theft, and extortion had\r prevailed among the officials from time immemorial, and the most active\r kings alone were able to repress these abuses, or confine them within\r narrow limits; as soon as discipline became relaxed, however, they began\r to appear again, and we have no more convincing proof of the state of\r decadence into which Thebes had fallen towards the middle of the XXth\r dynasty, than the audacity of the crimes committed in the necropolis\r during the reigns of the successors of Ramses III.", "The priesthood of Amon alone displayed any vigour and enjoyed any\r prosperity in the general decline.", "After the victory of the god over the\r heretic kings no one dared to dispute his supremacy, and the Ramessides\r displayed a devout humility before him and his ministers.", "Henceforward\r he became united to Râ in a definite manner, and his authority not only\r extended over the whole of the land of Egypt, but over all the countries\r also which were brought within her influence; so that while Pharaoh\r continued to be the greatest of kings, Pharaohs god held a position\r of undivided supremacy among the deities.", "He was the chief of the two\r Bnneads, the Heliopolitan and the Hermopolitan, and displayed for\r the latter a special affection; for the vague character of its eight\r secondary deities only served to accentuate the position of the ninth\r and principal divinity with whose primacy that of Amon was identified.", "It was more easy to attribute to Amon the entire work of creation when\r Shû, Sibû, Osiris, and Sit had been excluded--the deities whom the\r theologians of Heliopolis had been accustomed to associate with the\r demiurge; and in the hymns which they sang at his solemn festivals they\r did not hesitate to ascribe to him all the acts which the priests of\r former times had assigned to the Ennead collectively.", "He made earth,\r silver, gold,--the true lapis at his good pleasure.--He brought forth\r the herbs for the cattle, the plants upon which men live.--He made to\r live the fish of the river,--the birds which hover in the air,--giving\r air to those which are in the egg.--He animates the insects,--he makes\r to live the small birds, the reptiles, and the gnats as well.--He\r provides food for the rat in his hole,--supports the bird upon the\r branch.--May he be blessed for all this, he who is alone, but with many\r hands. Men spring from his two eyes, and quickly do they lose\r their breath while acclaiming him--Egyptians and Libyans, Negroes and\r Asiatics: Hail to thee! they all say; praise to thee because thou\r dwellest amongst us!--Obeisances before thee because thou createst\r us!--Thou art blessed by every living thing,--thou hast worshippers in\r every place,--in the highest of the heavens, in all the breadth of\r the earth,--in the depths of the seas.--The gods bow before thy\r Majesty,--magnifying the souls which form them,--rejoicing at meeting\r those who have begotten them,--they say to thee: Go in peace,--father\r of the fathers of all the gods,--who suspended the heaven, levelled the\r earth;--creator of beings, maker of things,--sovereign king, chief of\r the gods,--we adore thy souls, because thou hast made us,--we lavish\r offerings upon thee, because thou hast given us birth,--we shower\r benedictions upon thee, because thou dwellest among us. We have here\r the same ideas as those which predominate in the hymns addressed to\r Atonû,* and in the prayers directed to Phtah, the Nile, Shû, and the\r Sun-god of Heliopolis at the same period.", "* Breasted points out the decisive influence exercised by\r      the solar hymns of Amenôthes IV.", "on the development of the\r      solar ideas contained in the hymns to Amon put forth or re-\r      edited in the XXIIIrd dynasty.", "The idea of a single god, lord and maker of all things, continued to\r prevail more and more throughout Egypt--not, indeed, among the lower\r classes who persisted in the worship of their genii and their animals,\r but among the royal family, the priests, the nobles, and people of\r culture.", "The latter believed that the Sun-god had at length absorbed\r all the various beings who had been manifested in the feudal divinities:\r these, in fact, had surrendered their original characteristics in order\r to become forms of the Sun, Amon as well as the others--and the new\r belief displayed itself in magnifying the solar deity, but the solar\r deity united with the Theban Amon, that is, Amon-Râ.", "The omnipotence of\r this one god did not, however, exclude a belief in the existence of his\r compeers; the theologians thought all the while that the beings to whom\r ancient generations had accorded a complete independence in respect of\r their rivals were nothing more than emanations from one supreme being.", "If local pride forced them to apply to this single deity the designation\r customarily used in their city--Phtah at Memphis, Anhûri-Shû at Thinis,\r Khnûmû in the neighbourhood of the first cataract--they were quite\r willing to allow, at the same time, that these appellations were but\r various masks for one face.", "Phtah, Hâpi, Khnûmû, Râ,--all the gods, in\r fact,--were blended with each other, and formed but one deity--a unique\r existence, multiple in his names, and mighty according to the importance\r of the city in which he was worshipped.", "Hence Amon, lord of the capital\r and patron of the dynasty, having more partisans, enjoyed more respect,\r and, in a word, felt himself possessed of more claims to be the sole god\r of Egypt than his brethren, who could not claim so many worshippers.", "He\r did not at the outset arrogate to himself the same empire over the dead\r as he exercised over the living; he had delegated his functions in this\r respect to a goddess, Marîtsakro, for whom the poorer inhabitants of the\r left bank entertained a persistent devotion.", "She was a kind of Isis or\r hospitable Hathor, whose subjects in the other world adapted themselves\r to the nebulous and dreary existence provided for their disembodied\r doubles. The Osirian and solar doctrines were afterwards blended\r together in this local mythology, and from the XIth dynasty onwards the\r Theban nobility had adopted, along with the ceremonies in use in the\r Memphite period, the Heliopolitan beliefs concerning the wanderings\r of the soul in the west, its embarkation on the solar ship, and its\r resting-places in the fields of Ialû.", "The rock-tombs of the XVIIIth\r dynasty demonstrate that the Thebans had then no different concept of\r their life beyond the world from that entertained by the inhabitants\r of the most ancient cities: they ascribed to that existence the same\r inconsistent medley of contradictory ideas, from which each one might\r select what pleased him best--either repose in a well-provisioned tomb,\r or a dwelling close to Osiris in the middle of a calm and agreeable\r paradise, or voyages with Râ around the world.*\r \r      * The Pyramid texts are found for the most part in the tombs\r      of Nofirû and Harhôtpû; the texts of the Book of the Dead\r      are met with on the Theban coffins of the same period.", "[Illustration: 060.jpg DECORATED WRAPPINGS OF A MUMMY]\r \r The fusion of Râ and Amon, and the predominance of the solar idea which\r arose from it, forced the theologians to examine more closely these\r inconsistent notions, and to eliminate from them anything which might be\r out of harmony with the new views.", "The devout servant of Amon, desirous\r of keeping in constant touch with his god both here and in the other\r would, could not imagine a happier future for his soul than in its going\r forth in the fulness of light by day, and taking refuge by night on\r the very bark which carried the object of his worship through the thick\r darkness of, Hades.", "To this end he endeavoured to collect the formulae\r which would enable him to attain to this supreme happiness, and also\r inform him concerning the hidden mysteries of that obscure half of the\r world in which the sun dwelt between daylight and daylight, teaching him\r also how to make friends and supporters of the benevolent genii, and how\r to avoid or defeat the monsters whom he would encounter.", "The best\r known of the books relating to these mysteries contained a geographical\r description of the future world as it was described by the Theban\r priests towards the end of the Ramesside period; it was, in fact, an\r itinerary in which was depicted each separate region of the underworld,\r with its gates, buildings, and inhabitants.*\r \r      * The monumental text of this book is found sculptured on a\r      certain number of the tombs of the Theban kings.", "It was\r      first translated into English by Birch, then into French by\r      Dévéria, and by Maspero.", "The account of it given by the Egyptian theologians did not exhibit much\r inventive genius.", "They had started with the theory that the sun, after\r setting exactly west of Thebes, rose again due east of the city, and\r they therefore placed in the dark hemisphere all the regions of the\r universe which lay to the north of those two points of the compass.", "The\r first stage of the suns journey, after disappearing below the horizon,\r coincided with the period of twilight; the orb travelled along the open\r sky, diminishing the brightness of his fires as he climbed northward,\r and did not actually enter the underworld till he reached Abydos,\r close to the spot where, at the Mouth of the Cleft, the souls of the\r faithful awaited him.", "As soon as he had received them into his boat,\r he plunged into the tunnel which there pierces the mountains, and the\r cities through which he first passed between Abydos and the Fayûm were\r known as the Osirian fiefs.", "He continued his journey through them for\r the space of two hours, receiving the homage of the inhabitants, and\r putting such of the shades on shore as were predestined by their special\r devotion for the Osiris of Abydos and his associates, Horus and Anubis,\r to establish themselves in this territory.", "Beyond Heracleopolis, he\r entered the domains of the Memphite gods, the land of Sokaris, and\r this probably was the most perilous moment of his journey.", "[Illustration: 062.jpg ONE OF THE MYSTERIOUS BOOKS OF AMON]\r \r The feudatories of Phtah were gathered together in grottoes, connected\r by a labyrinth of narrow passages through which even the most fully\r initiated were scarcely able to find their way; the luminous boat,\r instead of venturing within these catacombs, passed above them by\r mysterious tracks.", "The crew were unable to catch a glimpse of the\r sovereign through whose realm they journeyed, and they in like manner\r were invisible to him; he could only hear the voices of the divine\r sailors, and he answered them from the depth of the darkness.", "Two hours\r were spent in this obscure passage, after which navigation became easier\r as the vessel entered the nomes subject to the Osirises of the Delta:\r four consecutive hours of sailing brought the bark from the province in\r which the four principal bodies of the god slept to that in which\r his four souls kept watch, and, as it passed, it illuminated the eight\r circles reserved for men and kings who worshipped the god of Mendes.", "From the tenth hour onwards it directed its course due south, and passed\r through the Aûgàrît, the place of fire and abysmal waters to which the\r Heliopolitans consigned the souls of the impious; then finally quitting\r the tunnel, it soared up in the east with the first blush of dawn.", "Each\r of the ordinary dead was landed at that particular hour of the twelve,\r which belonged to the god of his choice or of his native town.", "Left to\r dwell there they suffered no absolute torment, but languished in the\r darkness in a kind of painful torpor, from which condition the approach\r of the bark alone was able to rouse them.", "They hailed its daily coming\r with acclamations, and felt new life during the hour in which its rays\r fell on them, breaking out into lamentations as the bark passed away and\r the light disappeared with it.", "The souls who were devotees of the sun\r escaped this melancholy existence; they escorted the god, reduced though\r he was to a mummied corpse, on his nightly cruise, and were piloted by\r him safe and sound to meet the first streaks of the new day.", "As the\r boat issued from the mountain in the morning between the two trees which\r flanked the gate of the east, these souls had their choice of several\r ways of spending the day on which they were about to enter.", "They might\r join their risen god in his course through the hours of light, and\r assist him in combating Apophis and his accomplices, plunging again at\r night into Hades without having even for a moment quitted his side.", "[Illustration: 066.jpg THE ENTRANCE TO A ROYAL TOMB]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph, by Beato, of the\r      tomb of Ramses IV.", "[Illustration: 066b.jpg ONE OF THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT]\r \r They might, on the other hand, leave him and once more enter the world\r of the living, settling themselves where they would, but always by\r preference in the tombs where their bodies awaited them, and where they\r could enjoy the wealth which had been accumulated there: they might walk\r within their garden, and sit beneath the trees they had planted; they\r could enjoy the open air beside the pond they had dug, and breathe the\r gentle north breeze on its banks after the midday heat, until the time\r when the returning evening obliged them to repair once more to Abydos,\r and re-embark with the god in order to pass the anxious vigils of the\r night under his protection.", "Thus from the earliest period of Egyptian\r history the life beyond the tomb was an eclectic one, made up of a\r series of earthly enjoyments combined together.", "The Pharaohs had enrolled themselves instinctively among the most ardent\r votaries of this complex doctrine.", "Their relationship to the sun made\r its adoption a duty, and its profession was originally, perhaps, one of\r the privileges of their position.", "Râ invited them on board because they\r were his children, subsequently extending this favour to those whom\r they should deem worthy to be associated with them, and thus become\r companions of the ancient deceased kings of Upper and Lower Egypt.*\r \r      * This is apparently what we gather from the picture\r      inserted in chapter xvii.", "of the Book of the Dead, where\r      we see the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt guiding the divine\r      bark and the deceased with them.", "The idea which the Egyptians thus formed of the other world, and of the\r life of the initiated within it, reacted gradually on their concept of\r the tomb and of its befitting decoration.", "They began to consider the\r entrances to the pyramid, and its internal passages and chambers, as a\r conventional representation of the gates, passages, and halls of Hades\r itself; when the pyramid passed out of fashion, and they had replaced\r it by a tomb cut in the rock in one or other of the branches of the Bab\r el-Moluk valley, the plan of construction which they chose was an exact\r copy of that employed by the Memphites and earlier Thebans, and they\r hollowed out for themselves in the mountain-side a burying-place on the\r same lines as those formerly employed within the pyramidal structure.", "The relative positions of the tunnelled tombs along the valley were not\r determined by any order of rank or of succession to the throne; each\r Pharaoh after Ramses I.", "set to work on that part of the rock where the\r character of the stone favoured his purpose, and displayed so little\r respect for his predecessors, that the workmen, after having tunnelled\r a gallery, were often obliged to abandon it altogether, or to change the\r direction of their excavations so as to avoid piercing a neighbouring\r tomb.", "The architects design was usually a mere project which could be\r modified at will, and, which he did not feel bound to carry out with\r fidelity; the actual measurements of the tomb of Ramses IV.", "are almost\r everywhere at variance with the numbers and arrangement of the working\r drawing of it which has been preserved to us in a papyrus.", "The general\r disposition of the royal tombs, however, is far from being complicated;\r we have at the entrance the rectangular door, usually surmounted by the\r sun, represented by a yellow disk, before which the sovereign kneels\r with his hands raised in the posture of adoration; this gave access to\r a passage sloping gently downwards, and broken here and there by a level\r landing and steps, leading to a first chamber of varying amplitude, at\r the further end of which a second passage opened which descended to one\r or more apartments, the last of which, contained the coffin.", "The oldest\r rock-tombs present some noteworthy exceptions to this plan, particularly\r those of Seti I.", "and Ramses III.; but from the time of Ramses IV., there\r is no difference to be remarked in them except in the degree of finish\r of the wall-paintings or in the length of the passages.", "The shortest of\r the latter extends some fifty-two feet into the rock, while the longest\r never exceeds three hundred and ninety feet.", "The same artifices\r which had been used by the pyramid-builders to defeat the designs of\r robbers--false mummy-pits, painted and sculptured walls built across\r passages, stairs concealed under a movable stone in the corner of a\r chamber--were also employed by the Theban engineers.", "The decoration of\r the walls was suggested, as in earlier times, by the needs of the royal\r soul, with this difference--that the Thebans set themselves to render\r visible to his eyes by paintings that which the Memphites had been\r content to present to his intelligence in writing, so that the Pharaoh\r could now see what his ancestors had been able merely to read on the\r walls of their tombs.", "Where the inscribed texts in the burial-chamber\r of Unas state that Unas, incarnate in the Sun, and thus representing\r Osiris, sails over the waters on high or glides into the Elysian fields,\r the sculptured or painted scenes in the interior of the Theban catacombs\r display to the eye Ramses occupying the place of the god in the solar\r bark and in the fields of laid.", "Where the walls of Unas bear only the\r prayers recited over the mummy for the opening of his mouth, for the\r restoration of the use of his limbs, for his clothing, perfuming, and\r nourishment, we see depicted on those of Seti I.", "or Ramses IV.", "the\r mummies of these kings and the statues of their doubles in the hands\r of the priests, who are portrayed in the performance of these various\r offices.", "The starry ceilings of the pyramids reproduce the aspect of the\r sky, but without giving the names of the stars: on the ceilings of some\r of the Ramesside rock-tombs, on the other hand, the constellations are\r represented, each with its proper figure, while astronomical tables give\r the position of the heavenly bodies at intervals of fifteen days, so\r that the soul could tell at a glance into what region of the firmament\r the course of the bark would bring him each night.", "In the earlier\r Ramesside tombs, under Seti I.", "and Ramses II., the execution of these\r subjects shows evidence of a care and skill which are quite marvellous,\r and both figures and hieroglyphics betray the hand of accomplished\r artists.", "But in the tomb of Ramses III.", "the work has already begun to\r show signs of inferiority, and the majority of the scenes are coloured\r in a very summary fashion; a raw yellow predominates, and the tones of\r the reds and blues remind us of a childs first efforts at painting.", "This decline is even more marked under the succeeding Ramessides; the\r drawing has deteriorated, the tints have become more and more crude,\r and the latest paintings seem but a lamentable caricature of the earlier\r ones.", "The courtiers and all those connected with the worship of\r Amon-Râ--priests, prophets, singers, and functionaries connected with\r the necropolis--shared the same belief with regard to the future world\r as their sovereign, and they carried their faith in the suns power\r to the point of identifying themselves with him after death, and of\r substituting the name of Râ for that of Osiris; they either did not\r venture, however, to go further than this, or were unable to introduce\r into their tombs all that we find in the Bab el-Moluk.", "They confined\r themselves to writing briefly on their own coffins, or confiding to\r the mummies of their fellow-believers, in addition to the Book of the\r Dead, a copy of the Book of knowing what there is in Hades, or of\r some other mystic writing which was in harmony with their creed.", "Hastily\r prepared copies of these were sold by unscrupulous scribes, often badly\r written and almost always incomplete, in which were hurriedly set\r down haphazard the episodes of the course of the sun with explanatory\r illustrations.", "The representations of the gods in them are but little\r better than caricatures, the text is full of faults and scarcely\r decipherable, and it is at times difficult to recognize the\r correspondence of the scenes and prayers with those in the royal tombs.", "Although Amon had become the supreme god, at least for this class of\r the initiated, he was by no means the sole deity worshipped by the\r Egyptians: the other divinities previously associated with him still\r held their own beside him, or were further defined and invested with\r a more decided personality.", "The goddess regarded as his partner was at\r first represented as childless, in spite of the name of Maût or Mût--the\r mother--by which she was invoked, and Amon was supposed to have adopted\r Montû, the god of Hermonthis, in order to complete his triad.", "Montû,\r however, formerly the sovereign of the Theban plain, and lord over Amon\r himself, was of too exalted a rank to play the inferior part of a divine\r son.", "[Illustration: 074.jpg KHONSÛ* AND TEMPLE OF KHONSÛ**.]\r \r      * Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bronze statuette in the\r      Gizeh Museum.", "** Drawn by Thuillier: A is the pylon, B the court, C the\r      hypostyle hall, E the passage isolating the sanctuary, D the\r      sanctuary, F the opisthodomos with its usual chambers.", "The priests were, therefore, obliged to fall back upon a personage\r of lesser importance, named Khonsû, who up to that period had been\r relegated to an obscure position in the celestial hierarchy.", "How they\r came to identify him with the moon, and subsequently with Osiris and\r Thot, is as yet unexplained,* but the assimilation had taken place\r before the XIXth dynasty drew to its close.", "Khonsû, thus honoured, soon\r became a favourite deity with both the people and the upper classes,\r at first merely supplementing Montû, but finally supplanting him in the\r third place of the Triad.", "From the time of Sesostris onwards, Theban\r dogma acknowledged him alone side by side with Amon-Râ and Mût the\r divine mother.", "* It is possible that this assimilation originated in the\r      fact that Khonsû is derived from the verb khonsû, to\r      navigate: Khonsû would thus have been he who crossed the\r      heavens in his bark--that is, the moon-god.", "[Illustration: 075.jpg THE TEMPLE OF KHONSÛ AT KARNAK]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.", "It was now incumbent on the Pharaoh to erect to this newly made\r favourite a temple whose size and magnificence should be worthy of the\r rank to which his votaries had exalted him.", "To this end, Ramses III.", "chose a suitable site to the south of the hypostyle hall of Karnak,\r close to a corner of the enclosing wall, and there laid the foundations\r of a temple which his successors took nearly a century to finish.*\r \r      * The proof that the temple was founded by Ramses III.", "is\r      furnished by the inscriptions of the sanctuary and the\r      surrounding chambers.", "Its proportions are by no means perfect, the sculpture is wanting in\r refinement, the painting is coarse, and the masonry was so faulty, that\r it was found necessary in several places to cover it with a coat of\r stucco before the bas-reliefs could be carved on the walls; yet, in\r spite of all this, its general arrangement is so fine, that it may\r well be regarded, in preference to other more graceful or magnificent\r buildings, as the typical temple of the Theban period.", "It is divided\r into two parts, separated from each other by a solid wall.", "In the centre\r of the smaller of these is placed the Holy of Holies, which opens\r at both ends into a passage ten feet in width, isolating it from the\r surrounding buildings.", "To the right and left of the sanctuary are dark\r chambers, and behind it is a hall supported by four columns, into which\r open seven small apartments.", "This formed the dwelling-place of the god\r and his compeers.", "The sanctuary communicates, by means of two doors\r placed in the southern wall, with a hypostyle hall of greater width\r than depth, divided by its pillars into a nave and two aisles.", "The\r four columns of the nave are twenty-three feet in height, and have\r bell-shaped capitals, while those of the aisles, two on either side, are\r eighteen feet high, and are crowned with lotiform capitals.", "[Illustration: 077.jpg THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE OF KHONSÛ]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.", "The roof of the nave was thus five feet higher than those of the aisles,\r and in the clear storey thus formed, stone gratings, similar to those\r in the temple of Amon, admitted light to the building.", "The courtyard,\r surrounded by a fine colonnade of two rows of columns, was square, and\r was entered by four side posterns in addition to the open gateway at the\r end placed between two quadrangular towers.", "[Illustration: 078.jpg THE COLONNADE BUILT BY THÛTMOSIS III]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger and\r      Daniel Héron.", "This pylon measures 104 feet in length, and is 32 feet 6 inches wide,\r by 58 feet high.", "It contains no internal chambers, but merely a narrow\r staircase which leads to the top of the doorway, and thence to the\r summit of the towers.", "Four long angular grooves run up the façade of the\r towers to a height of about twenty feet from the ground, and are in\r the same line with a similar number of square holes which pierce the\r thickness of the building higher up.", "In these grooves were placed\r Venetian masts, made of poles spliced together and held in their place\r by means of hooks and wooden stays which projected from the four holes;\r these masts were to carry at their tops pennons of various colours.", "Such was the temple of Khonsû, and the majority of the great Theban\r buildings--at Luxor, Qurneh, and Bamesseum, or Medinet-Uabu--were\r constructed on similar lines.", "Even in their half-ruined condition there\r is something oppressive and uncanny in their appearance.", "The gods\r loved to shroud themselves in mystery, and, therefore, the plan of\r the building was so arranged as to render the transition almost\r imperceptible from the blinding sunlight outside to the darkness of\r their retreat within.", "In the courtyard, we are still surrounded by vast\r spaces to which air and light have free access.", "The hypostyle hall,\r however, is pervaded by an appropriate twilight, the sanctuary is veiled\r in still deeper darkness, while in the chambers beyond reigns an almost\r perpetual night.", "The effect produced by this gradation of obscurity\r was intensified by constructional artifices.", "The different parts of the\r building are not all on the same ground-level, the pavement rising as\r the sanctuary is approached, and the rise is concealed by a few steps\r placed at intervals.", "The difference of level in the temple of Khonsû is\r not more than five feet three inches, but it is combined with a still\r more considerable lowering of the height of the roof.", "From the pylon\r to the wall at the further end the height decreases as we go on; the\r peristyle is more lofty than the hypostyle hall, this again is higher\r than the sanctuary and the hall of columns, and the chamber beyond it\r drops still further in altitude.*\r \r      * This is the law of progressive diminution of heights of\r      Perrot-Chipiez.", "Karnak is an exception to this rule; this temple had in the course of\r centuries undergone so many restorations and additions, that it formed a\r collection of buildings rather than a single edifice.", "It might have\r been regarded, as early as the close of the Theban empire, as a kind of\r museum, in which every century and every period of art, from the XIIth\r dynasty downwards, had left its distinctive mark.*\r \r      * A on the plan denotes the XIIth dynasty temple; B is the\r      great hypostyle hall of Seti I.", "and Ramses II.; C the temple\r      of Ramses III.", "[Illustration: 081.jpg THE TEMPLE OF AMON AT KARNAK]\r \r All the resources of architecture had been brought into requisition\r during this period to vary, at the will of each sovereign, the\r arrangement and the general effect of the component parts.", "Columns with\r sixteen sides stand in the vicinity of square pillars, and lotiform\r capitals alternate with those of the bell-shape; attempts were even made\r to introduce new types altogether.", "The architect who built at the back\r of the sanctuary what is now known as the colonnade of Thûtmosis\r III., attempted to invert the bell-shaped capital; the bell was turned\r downwards, and the neck attached to the plinth, while the mouth rested\r on the top of the shaft.", "This awkward arrangement did not meet with\r favour, for we find it nowhere repeated; other artists, however, with\r better taste, sought at this time to apply the flowers symbolical of\r Upper and Lower Egypt to the decorations of the shafts.", "In front of the\r sanctuary of Karnak two pillars are still standing which have on them\r in relief representations respectively of the fullblown lotus and the\r papyrus.", "A building composed of so many incongruous elements required\r frequent restoration--a wall which had been undermined by water needed\r strengthening, a pylon displaying cracks claimed attention, some\r unsafe colonnade, or a colossus which had been injured by the fall of\r a cornice, required shoring up--so that no sooner had the corvée for\r repairs completed their work in one part, than they had to begin again\r elsewhere.", "[Illustration: 082.jpg THE TWO STELE-PILLARS AT KARNAK]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.", "The revenues of Amon must, indeed, have been enormous to have borne the\r continual drain occasioned by restoration, and the resources of the god\r would soon have been exhausted had not foreign wars continued to furnish\r him during several centuries with all or more than he needed.", "The gods had suffered severely in the troublous times which had followed\r the reign of Seti II., and it required all the generosity of Ramses III.", "to compensate them for the losses they had sustained during the anarchy\r under Arisû.", "The spoil taken from the Libyans, from the Peoples of the\r Sea, and from the Hittites had flowed into the sacred treasuries, while\r the able administration of the sovereign had done the rest, so that on\r the accession of Ramses IV.", "the temples were in a more prosperous state\r than ever.* They held as their own property 169 towns, nine of which\r were in Syria and Ethiopia; they possessed 113,433 slaves of both sexes,\r 493,386 head of cattle, 1,071,780 arurse of land, 514 vineyards and\r orchards, 88 barks and sea-going vessels, 336 kilograms of gold both in\r ingots and wrought, 2,993,964 grammes of silver, besides quantities of\r copper and precious stones, and hundreds of storehouses in which they\r kept corn, oil, wine, honey, and preserved meats--the produce of their\r domains.", "Two examples will suffice to show the extent of this latter\r item: the live geese reached the number of 680,714, and the salt or\r smoked fish that of 494,800.** Amon claimed the giant share of this\r enormous total, and three-fourths of it or more were reserved for his\r use, namely---86,486 slaves, 421,362 head of cattle, 898,168 _arurse_\r of cornland, 433 vineyards and orchards, and 56 Egyptian towns.", "The nine\r foreign towns all belonged to him, and one of them contained the temple\r in which he was worshipped by the Syrians whenever they came to pay\r their tribute to the kings representatives: it was but just that his\r patrimony should surpass that of his compeers, since the conquering\r Pharaohs owed their success to him, who, without the co-operation of the\r other feudal deities, had lavished victories upon them.", "* The donations of Ramses III., or rather the total of the\r      donations made to the gods by the predecessors of that\r      Pharaoh, and confirmed and augmented by him, are enumerated\r      at length in the _Great Harris Papyrus_.", "** An abridgement of these donations occupies seven large\r      plates in the _Great Harris Papyrus_.", "His domain was at least five times more considerable than that of Râ of\r Heliopolis, and ten times greater than that of the Memphite Phtah, and\r yet of old, in the earlier times of history, Râ and Phtah were reckoned\r the wealthiest of the Egyptian gods.", "It is easy to understand the\r influence which a god thus endowed with the goods of this world\r exercised over men in an age when the national wars had the same\r consequences for the immortals as for their worshippers, and when the\r defeat of a people was regarded as a proof of the inferiority of\r its patron gods.", "The most victorious divinity became necessarily the\r wealthiest, before whom all other deities bowed, and whom they, as well\r as their subjects, were obliged to serve.", "So powerful a god as Amon had but few obstacles to surmount before\r becoming the national deity; indeed, he was practically the foremost of\r the gods during the Ramesside period, and was generally acknowledged\r as Egypts representative by all foreign nations.* His priests shared in\r the prestige he enjoyed, and their influence in state affairs increased\r proportionately with his power.", "* From the XVIIIth dynasty, at least, the first prophet of\r      Amon had taken the precedence of the high priests of\r      Heliopolis and Memphis, as is proved by the position he\r      occupies in the Egyptian hierarchy in the _Hood Papyrus_.", "The chief of their hierarchy, however, did not bear the high titles\r which in ancient times distinguished those of Memphis and Heliopolis; he\r was content with the humble appellation of first prophet of Amon.", "He\r had for several generations been nominated by the sovereign, but he was\r generally chosen from the families attached hereditarily or otherwise\r to the temple of Karnak, and must previously have passed through every\r grade of the priestly hierarchy.", "Those who aspired to this honour had to\r graduate as divine fathers; this was the first step in the initiation,\r and one at which many were content to remain, but the more ambitious or\r favoured advanced by successive stages to the dignity of third, and then\r of second, prophet before attaining to the highest rank.*\r \r      * What we know on this subject has been brought to light\r      mainly by the inscriptions on the statue of Baûkûni-Khonsû\r      at Munich, published and commented on by Dévéria, and by\r      Lauth.", "The cursus honorum of Ramâ shows us that he was first\r      third, then second prophet of Amon, before being raised to\r      the pontificate in the reign of Mînephtah.", "The Pharaohs of the XIXth dynasty jealously supervised the promotions\r made in the Theban temples, and saw that none was elected except him who\r was devoted to their interests--such as, for example, Baûkûni-khonsû\r and Unnofri under Ramses II.", "Baûkûni-khonsû distinguished himself by his\r administrative qualities; if he did not actually make the plans for the\r hypostyle hall at Karnak, he appears at least to have superintended\r its execution and decoration.", "He finished the great pylon, erected the\r obelisks and gateways, built the _bari_ or vessel of the god, and found\r a further field for his activity on the opposite bank of the Nile, where\r he helped to complete both the chapel at Qurneh and also the Ramesseum.", "Ramses II.", "had always been able to make his authority felt by the high\r priests who succeeded Baûkûni-khonsû, but the Pharaohs who followed him\r did not hold the reins with such a strong hand.", "As early as the reigns\r of Mînephtah and Seti II.", "the first prophets, Raî and Ramâ, claimed the\r right of building at Karnak for their own purposes, and inscribed on the\r walls long inscriptions in which their own panegyrics took precedence\r of that of the sovereign; they even aspired to a religious hegemony, and\r declared themselves to be the chief of all the prophets of the gods\r of the South and North. We do not know what became of them during the\r usurpation of Arisû, but Nakhtû-ramses, son of Miribastît, who filled\r the office during the reign of Ramses III., revived these ambitious\r projects as soon as the state of Egypt appeared to favour them.", "The\r king, however pious he might be, was not inclined to yield up any of his\r authority, even though it were to the earthly delegate of the divinity\r whom he reverenced before all others; the sons of the Pharaoh were,\r however, more accommodating, and Nakhtû-ramses played his part so well\r that he succeeded in obtaining from them the reversion of the high\r priesthood for his son Amenôthes.", "The priestly office, from having been\r elective, was by this stroke suddenly made hereditary in the family.", "The kings preserved, it is true, the privilege of confirming the new\r appointment, and the nominee was not considered properly qualified until\r he had received his investiture from the sovereign.*\r \r      * This is proved by the Maunier stele, now in the Louvre; it\r      is there related how the high priest Manakh-pirrî received\r      his investiture from the Tanite king.", "Practically the Pharaohs lost the power of choosing one among the sons\r of the deceased pontiff; they were forced to enthrone the eldest of his\r survivors, and legalise his accession by their approbation, even when\r they would have preferred another.", "It was thus that a dynasty of vassal\r High Priests came to be established at Thebes side by side with the\r royal dynasty of the Pharaohs.", "The new priestly dynasty was not long in making its power felt in\r Thebes.", "Nakhtû-ramses and Amenôthes lived to a great age--from the reign\r of Ramses III.", "to that of Ramses X., at the least; they witnessed the\r accession of nine successive Pharaohs, and the unusual length of their\r pontificates no doubt increased the already extraordinary prestige which\r they enjoyed throughout the length and breadth of Egypt.", "It seemed as if\r the god delighted to prolong the lives of his representatives beyond the\r ordinary limits, while shortening those of the temporal sovereigns.", "When\r the reigns of the Pharaohs began once more to reach their normal length,\r the authority of Amenôthes had become so firmly established that no\r human power could withstand it, and the later Ramessides were merely a\r set of puppet kings who were ruled by him and his successors.", "Not only\r was there a cessation of foreign expeditions, but the Delta, Memphis,\r and Ethiopia were alike neglected, and the only activity displayed\r by these Pharaohs, as far as we can gather from their monuments, was\r confined to the service of Amon and Khonsû at Thebes.", "The lack of energy\r and independence in these sovereigns may not, however, be altogether\r attributable to their feebleness of character; it is possible that they\r would gladly have entered on a career of conquest had they possessed\r the means.", "It is always a perilous matter to allow the resources of\r a country to fall into the hands of a priesthood, and to place its\r military forces at the same time in the hands of the chief religious\r authority.", "The warrior Pharaohs had always had at their disposal the\r spoils obtained from foreign nations to make up the deficit which their\r constant gifts to the temples were making in the treasury.", "The sons\r of Ramses III., on the other hand, had suspended all military efforts,\r without, however, lessening their lavish gifts to the gods, and they\r must, in the absence of the spoils of war, have drawn to a considerable\r extent upon the ordinary resources of the country; their successors\r therefore found the treasury impoverished, and they would have been\r entirely at a loss for money had they attempted to renew the campaigns\r or continue the architectural work of their forefathers.", "The priests of\r Amon had not as yet suffered materially from this diminution of revenue,\r for they possessed property throughout the length and breadth of Egypt,\r but they were obliged to restrict their expenditure, and employ the sums\r formerly used for the enlarging of the temples on the maintenance\r of their own body.", "Meanwhile public works had been almost everywhere\r suspended; administrative discipline became relaxed, and disturbances,\r with which the police were unable to cope, were increasing in all the\r important towns.", "Nothing is more indicative of the state to which Egypt\r was reduced, under the combined influence of the priesthood and the\r Ramessides, than the thefts and pillaging of which the Theban necropolis\r was then the daily scene.", "The robbers no longer confined themselves\r to plundering the tombs of private persons; they attacked the royal\r burying-places, and their depredations were carried on for years before\r they were discovered.", "In the reign of Ramses IX., an inquiry, set on\r foot by Amenôthes, revealed the fact that the tomb of Sovkûmsaûf I.", "and\r his wife, Queen Nûbk-hâs, had been rifled, that those of Amenôthes I.", "and of Antuf IV.", "had been entered by tunnelling, and that some dozen\r other royal tombs in the cemetery of Drah abul Neggah were threatened.*\r \r      * The principal part of this inquiry constitutes the _Abbott\r      Papyrus_, acquired and published by the British Museum,\r      first examined and made the subject of study by Birch,\r      translated simultaneously into French by Maspero and by\r      Chabas, into German by Lauth and by Erman.", "Other papyri\r      relate to the same or similar occurrences, such as the Salt\r      and Amherst Papyri published by Chabas, and also the\r      Liverpool Papyri, of which we possess merely scattered\r      notices in the writings of Goodwin, and particularly in\r      those of Spiegelberg.", "The severe means taken to suppress the evil were not, however,\r successful; the pillagings soon began afresh, and the reigns of the last\r three Ramessides between the robbers and the authorities, were marked by\r a struggle in which the latter did not always come off triumphant.", "[Illustration: 089.jpg RAMSES IX.]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Lepsius.", "A system of repeated inspections secured the valley of Biban el-Moluk\r from marauders,* but elsewhere the measures of defence employed were\r unavailing, and the necropolis was given over to pillage, although both\r Amenôthes and Hrihor had used every effort to protect it.", "* Graffiti which are evidences of these inspections have\r      been drawn on the walls of several royal tombs by the\r      inspectors.", "Others have been found on several of the coffins\r      discovered at

succeeded immediately after Amenôthes, and\r his accession to the pontificate gave his family a still more exalted\r position in the country.", "As his wife Nozmit was of royal blood, he\r assumed titles and functions to which his father and grandfather\r had made no claim.", "He became the Royal Son of Ethiopia and\r commander-in-chief of the national and foreign troops; he engraved his\r name upon the monuments he decorated, side by side with that of Ramses\r XII.; in short, he possessed all the characteristics of a Pharaoh except\r the crown and the royal protocol.", "A century scarcely had elapsed since\r the abdication of Ramses III., and now Thebes and the whole of Egypt\r owned two masters: one the embodiment of the ancient line, but a mere\r nominal king; the other the representative of Amon, and the actual ruler\r of the country.", "What then happened when the last Ramses who bore the kingly title was\r gathered to his fathers?", "The royal lists record the accession after his\r death of a new dynasty of Tanitic origin, whose founder was Nsbindidi\r or Smendes; but, on the other hand, we gather from the Theban monuments\r that the crown was seized by Hrihor, who reigned over the southern\r provinces contemporaneously with Smendes.", "Hrihor boldly assumed as\r prenomen his title of First Prophet of Amon, and his authority was\r acknowledged by Ethiopia, over which he was viceroy, as well as by the\r nomes forming the temporal domain of the high priests.", "The latter had\r acquired gradually, either by marriage or inheritance, fresh territory\r for the god, in the lands of the princes of Nekhabît, Kop-tos, Akhmîm,\r and Abydos, besides the domains of some half-dozen feudal houses\r who, from force of circumstances, had become sacerdotal families; the\r extinction of the direct line of Ramessides now secured the High\r Priests the possession of Thebes itself, and of all the lands within the\r southern provinces which were the appanage of the crown.", "[Illustration: 091.jpg HRIHOR]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Champollion.", "They thus, in one way or another, became the exclusive masters of the\r southern half of the Nile valley, from Elephantine to Siut; beyond Siut\r also they had managed to acquire suzerainty over the town of Khobît, and\r the territory belonging to it formed an isolated border province in the\r midst of the independent baronies.*\r \r      * The extent of the principality of Thebes under the high\r      priests has been determined by means of the sacerdotal\r      titles of the Theban princesses.", "The representative of the dynasty reigning at Tanis held the remainder\r of Egypt from Shit to the Mediterranean--the half belonging to the\r Memphite Phtah and the Helio-politan Râ, as opposed to that assigned to\r Anion.", "The origin of this Tanite sovereign is uncertain, but it would\r appear that he was of more exalted rank than his rival in the south.", "The\r official chronicling of events was marked by the years of his reign, and\r the chief acts of the government were carried out in his name even in\r the Thebaid.* Repeated inundations had caused the ruin of part of the\r temple of Karnak, and it was by the order and under the auspices of this\r prince that all the resources of the country were employed to accomplish\r the much-needed restoration.**\r \r      * I have pointed out that the years of the reign mentioned\r      in the inscriptions of the high priests and the kings of the\r      sacerdotal line must be attributed to their suzerains, the\r      kings of Tanis.", "Hrihor alone seems to have been an\r      exception, since to him are attributed the dates inscribed\r      in the name of the King Siamon: M.", "Daressy, however, will\r      not admit this, and asserts that this Siamon was a Tanite\r      sovereign who must not be identified with Hrihor, and must\r      be placed at least two or three generations later than the\r      last of the Ramessides.", "* The real name Nsbindidi and the first monument of the\r      Manethonian Smendes were discovered in the quarries of\r      Dababîeh, opposite Gebelên.", "It would have been impossible for him to have exercised any authority\r over so rich and powerful a personage as Hrihor had he not possessed\r rights to the crown, before which even the high priests of Amon were\r obliged to bow, and hence it has been supposed that he was a descendant\r of Ramses II.", "The descendants of this sovereign were doubtless divided\r into at least two branches, one of which had just become extinct,\r leaving no nearer heir than Hrihor, while another, of which there were\r many ramifications, had settled in the Delta.", "The majority of these\r descendants had become mingled with the general population, and had sunk\r to the condition of private individuals; they had, however, carefully\r preserved the tradition of their origin, and added proudly to their name\r the qualification of royal son of Ramses.", "They were degenerate scions\r of the Ramessides, and had neither the features nor the energy of their\r ancestor.", "One of them, Zodphta-haûfônkhi, whose mummy was found at Deîr\r el-Baharî, appears to have been tall and vigorous, but the head lacks\r the haughty refinement which characterizes those of Seti I.", "and Ramses\r II., and the features are heavy and coarse, having a vulgar, commonplace\r expression.", "[Illustration: 093.jpg ZODPHTAHAUFONKHI, ROYAL SON OF RAMSES]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the photograph by Insinger.", "It seems probable that one branch of the family, endowed with greater\r capability than the rest, was settled at Tanis, where Sesostris had,\r as we have seen, resided for many years; Smendes was the first of this\r branch to ascend the throne.", "The remembrance of his remote ancestor,\r Ramses IL, which was still treasured up in the city he had completely\r rebuilt, as well as in the Delta into which he had infused new life, was\r doubtless of no small service in securing the crown for his descendant,\r when, the line of the Theban kings having come to an end, the Tanites\r put in their claim to the succession.", "We are unable to discover if\r war broke out between the two competitors, or if they arrived at an\r agreement without a struggle; but, at all events, we may assume that,\r having divided Egypt between them, neither of them felt himself strong\r enough to overcome his rival, and contented himself with the possession\r of half the empire, since he could not possess it in its entirety.", "We\r may fairly believe that Smendes had the greater right to the throne,\r and, above all, the more efficient army of the two, since, had it been\r otherwise, Hrihor would never have consented to yield him the priority.", "The unity of Egypt was, to outward appearances, preserved, through the\r nominal possession by Smendes of the suzerainty; but, as a matter of\r fact, it had ceased to exist, and the fiction of the two kingdoms\r had become a reality for the first time within the range of history.", "Henceforward there were two Egypts, governed by different constitutions\r and from widely remote centres.", "Theban Egypt was, before all things,\r a community recognizing a theocratic government, in which the kingly\r office was merged in that of the high priest.", "Separated from Asia by the\r length of the Delta, it turned its attention, like the Pharaohs of the\r VIth and XIIth dynasties, to Ethiopia, and owing to its distance from\r the Mediterranean, and from the new civilization developed on its\r shores, it became more and more isolated, till at length it was reduced\r to a purely African state.", "Northern Egypt, on the contrary, maintained\r contact with European and Asiatic nations; it took an interest in their\r future, it borrowed from them to a certain extent whatever struck it as\r being useful or beautiful, and when the occasion presented itself, it\r acted in concert with Mediterranean powers.", "There was an almost constant\r struggle between these two divisions of the empire, at times\r breaking out into an open rupture, to end as often in a temporary\r re-establishment of unity.", "At one time Ethiopia would succeed in\r annexing Egypt, and again Egypt would seize some part of Ethiopia; but\r the settlement of affairs was never final, and the conflicting elements,\r brought with difficulty into harmony, relapsed into their usual\r condition at the end of a few years.", "A kingdom thus divided against\r itself could never succeed in maintaining its authority over those\r provinces which, even in the heyday of its power, had proved impatient\r of its yoke.", "Asia was associated henceforward in the minds of the Egyptians with\r painful memories of thwarted ambitions, rather than as offering a field\r for present conquest.", "They were pursued by the memories of their former\r triumphs, and the very monuments of their cities recalled what they\r were anxious to forget.", "Wherever they looked within their towns they\r encountered the representation of some Asiatic scene; they read the\r names of the cities of Syria on the walls of their temples; they saw\r depicted on them its princes and its armies, whose defeat was recorded\r by the inscriptions as well as the tribute which they had been forced\r to pay.", "The sense of their own weakness prevented the Egyptians from\r passing from useless regrets to action; when, however, one or other of\r the Pharaohs felt sufficiently secure on the throne to carry his troops\r far afield, he was always attracted to Syria, and crossed her frontiers,\r often, alas!", "merely to encounter defeat.", "[Illustration: 095.jpg Tailpiece]\r

borrowed from Semitic speech, the Syrians, on the other hand, were\r not unreceptive of the influence of their conquerors.", "They had applied\r themselves zealously to the study of Egyptian arts, industry and\r religion, and had borrowed from these as much, at least, as they had\r lent to the dwellers on the Nile.", "The ancient Babylonian foundation\r of their civilization was not, indeed, seriously modified, but it was\r covered over, so to speak, with an African veneer which varied in depth\r according to the locality.*\r \r      * Most of the views put forth in this part of the chapter\r      are based on posterior and not contemporary data.", "The most\r      ancient monuments which give evidence of it show it in such\r      a complete state that we may fairly ascribe it to some\r      centuries earlier; that is, to the time when Egypt still\r      ruled in Syria, the period of the XIXth and even the XVIIIth\r      dynasty.", "Phoenicia especially assumed and retained this foreign exterior.", "Its\r merchants, accustomed to establish themselves for lengthened periods in\r the principal trade-centres on the Nile, had become imbued therein\r with something of the religious ideas and customs of the land, and\r on returning to their own country had imported these with them and\r propagated them in their neighbourhood.", "They were not content with other\r household utensils, furniture, and jewellery than those to which they\r had been accustomed on the Nile, and even the Phonician gods seemed to\r be subject to this appropriating mania, for they came to be recognised\r in the indigenous deities of the Said and the Delta.", "There was, at\r the outset, no trait in the character of Baalat by which she could be\r assimilated to Isis or Hathor: she was fierce, warlike, and licentious,\r and wept for her lover, while the Egyptian goddesses were accustomed\r to shed tears for their husbands only.", "It was this element of a common\r grief, however, which served to associate the Phonician and Egyptian\r goddesses, and to produce at length a strange blending of their persons\r and the legends concerning them; the lady of Byblos ended in becoming an\r Isis or a Hathor,* and in playing the part assigned to the latter in the\r Osirian drama.", "* The assimilation must have been ancient, since the Egyptians of the\r Theban dynasties already accepted Baalat as the Hathor of Byblos.", "[Illustration: 101.jpg THE TREE GROWING ON THE TOMB OF OSIRIS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Prisse dAvennes\r \r This may have been occasioned by her city having maintained closer\r relationships than the southern towns with Bûto and Mendes, or by her\r priests having come to recognise a fundamental agreement between their\r theology and that of Egypt.", "In any case, it was at Byblos that the most\r marked and numerous, as well as the most ancient, examples of borrowing\r from the religions of the Nile were to be found.", "The theologians of\r Byblos imagined that the coffin of Osiris, after it had been thrown into\r the sea by Typhon, had been thrown up on the land somewhere near their\r city at the foot of a tamarisk, and that this tree, in its rapid growth,\r had gradually enfolded within its trunk the body and its case.", "King\r Malkander cut it down in order to use it as a support for the roof of\r his palace: a marvellous perfume rising from it filled the apartments,\r and it was not long before the prodigy was bruited abroad.", "Isis, who was\r travelling through the world in quest of her husband, heard of it, and\r at once realised its meaning: clad in rags and weeping, she sat down\r by the well whither the women of Byblos were accustomed to come every\r morning and evening to draw water, and, being interrogated by them,\r refused to reply; but when the maids of Queen Astartê* approached\r in their turn, they were received by the goddess in the most amiable\r manner--Isis deigning even to plait their hair, and to communicate to\r them the odour of myrrh with which she herself was impregnated.", "* Astartê is the name taken by the queen in the Phoenician\r      version: the Egyptian counterpart of the same narrative\r      substituted for it Nemanous or Saôsis; that is to say, the\r      two principal forms of Hathor--the Hermopolitan Nahmâûît and\r      the Heliopolitan lûsasît.", "It would appear from the presence\r      of these names that there must have been in Egypt two\r      versions at least of the Phoenician adventures of Isis--the\r      one of Hermopolitan and the other of Heliopolitan origin.", "Their mistress came to see the stranger who had thus treated her\r servants, took her into her service, and confided to her the care of her\r lately born son.", "Isis became attached to the child, adopted it for her\r own, after the Egyptian manner, by inserting her finger in its mouth;\r and having passed it through the fire during the night in order to\r consume away slowly anything of a perishable nature in its body,\r metamorphosed herself into a swallow, and flew around the miraculous\r pillar uttering plaintive cries.", "Astartê came upon her once while she\r was bathing the child in the flame, and broke by her shrieks of\r fright the charm of immortality.", "Isis was only able to reassure her by\r revealing her name and the object of her presence there.", "She opened the\r mysterious tree-trunk, anointed it with essences, and wrapping it in\r precious cloths, transmitted it to the priests of Byblos, who deposited\r it respectfully in their temple: she put the coffin which it contained\r on board ship, and brought it, after many adventures, into Egypt.", "Another tradition asserts, however, that Osiris never found his way back\r to his country: he was buried at Byblos, this tradition maintained, and\r it was in his honour that the festivals attributed by the vulgar to the\r young Adonis were really celebrated.", "A marvellous fact seemed to support\r this view.", "Every year a head of papyrus, thrown into the sea at some\r unknown point of the Delta, was carried for six days along the Syrian\r coast, buffeted by wind and waves, and on the seventh was thrown up at\r Byblos, where the priests received it and exhibited it solemnly to the\r people.* The details of these different stories are not in every case\r very ancient, but the first fact in them carries us back to the time\r when Byblos had accepted the sovereignty of the Theban dynasties,\r and was maintaining daily commercial and political relations with the\r inhabitants of the Nile valley.**\r \r      * In the later Roman period it was letters announcing the\r      resurrection of Adonis-Osiris that the Alexandrian women\r      cast into the sea, and these were carried by the current as\r      far as Byblos.", "See on this subject the commentaries of Cyril\r      of Alexandra and Procopius of Gaza on chap, xviii.", "of\r      Isaiah.", "** It is worthy of note that Philo gives to the divinity\r      with the Egyptian name Taautos the part in the ancient\r      history of Phoenicia of having edited

Baalat became blended\r together at their first encounter, and the respective peoples made\r an exchange of their deities with the same light-heartedness as they\r displayed in trafficking with the products of their soil or their\r industry.", "* This is confirmed by one of the names inscribed on the Tel\r      el-Amarna tablets as being that of a governor of Byblos\r      under Amenôthes IV.", "This name was read Rabimur, Anrabimur,\r      or Ilrabimur, and finally Ilurabihur: the meaning of it is,\r      Muru is the great god, or Horus is the great god. Muru is\r      the name which we find in an appellation of a Hittite king,\r      Maurusaru, Mauru is king. On an Aramoan cylinder in the\r      British Museum, representing a god in Assyrian dress\r      fighting with two

particular divinity with whom he was\r identified, or would be the more readily associated from some similarity\r in the pronunciation of his name: we know only that he still preserved\r in his new country all the power of his voice and all the subtilty of\r his mind.", "He occupied there also the position of scribe and enchanter,\r as he had done at Thebes, Memphis, Thinis, and before the chief of each\r Heliopolitan Ennead.", "He became the usual adviser of El-Kronos at Byblos,\r as he had been of Osiris and Horus; he composed charms for him,\r and formulae which increased the warlike zeal of his partisans; he\r prescribed the form and insignia of the god and of his attendant\r deities, and came finally to be considered as the inventor of letters.*\r \r      * The part of counsellor

descendants\r of their inhabitants, or by priests charged with the duty of keeping\r them up.", "Chapels of more recent generations extended as a sort of screen\r before the ancient tombs, affording examples of the two archaic types\r combined--the mastaba more or less curtailed in its proportions, and the\r pyramid with a more or less acute point.", "The majority of these monuments\r are no

that the monument is not older than the\r      Greek epoch, and it must be admitted that the cornice is not\r      such as we usually meet with in Egypt in Theban times;\r      nevertheless, the very marked resemblance to the Theban\r      mastaba shows that it must have been directly connected with\r      the Egyptian type which prevailed from the XVIIIth to the\r      XXth dynasties.",

six lower courses\r consist of blocks, each some sixteen and a half feet long, joined to each\r other without mortar.", "The two lowest courses project so as to form a\r kind of pedestal for the building.", "The cornice at the top consists of\r a deep moulding, surmounted by a broad flat band, above which rises the\r pyramid, which attains a height of nearly thirty feet.", "It is impossible\r to deny that it is constructed on a foreign model; it is not a slavish\r imitation, however, but rather an adaptation upon a rational plan to\r the conditions of its new home.", "Its foundations rest on nothing but a\r mixture of soil and sand impregnated with water, and if vaults had been\r constructed beneath this, as in Egypt, the body placed there would soon\r have corrupted away, owing to the infiltration of moisture.", "The dead\r bodies were, therefore, placed within the structure above ground, in\r chambers corresponding to the Egyptian chapel, which were superimposed\r the one upon the other.", "The first storey would furnish space for three\r bodies, and the second would contain twelve, for which as many niches\r were provided.", "In the same cemetery we find examples of tombs which the\r architect has constructed, not after an Egyptian, but a Chaldæan model.", "A round tower is here substituted for the square structure and a\r cupola for the pyramid, while the cornice is

Babylonian influence, and such\r examples of burying-places for the ruling classes as the Kabr-Hiram\r and other similar tombs correspond with the mixed mastaba of the Theban\r period.", "We have the same rectangular base, but the chapel and its\r crowning pyramid are represented by the sarcophagus itself with its\r rigid cover.", "The work is of an unfinished character, and carelessly\r wrought,

as\r goldsmithswork, sculpture in ivory, engraving on gems, and\r glass-making.", "The forms, designs, and colours are all rather those of\r Egypt than of Chaldæa.", "The many-hued glass objects, turned out by the\r manufacturers of the Said in millions, furnished at one time valuable\r cargoes for the Phoenicians; they learned at length to cast and\r colour copies of these at home, and imitated their Egyptian models so\r successfully that classical antiquity was often deceived by them.*\r \r      * Glass manufacture was carried to such a degree of\r      perfection among the Phoenicians, that many ancient authors\r      attributed to them the invention of glass.", "Their engravers, while still continuing to employ cones and cylinders\r of Babylonian form, borrowed the scarab type also, and made use of it\r on the bezils of rings, the pendants of necklaces, and on a kind of\r bracelet used partly for ornament and partly as a protective amulet.", "The influence of the Egyptian model did not extend, however, amongst the\r masses, and we find, therefore, no evidence of it in the case of common\r objects, such as those of coarse sand or glazed earthenware.", "Egyptian\r scarab forms were thus confined to the rich, and the material upon which\r they are found is generally some costly gem, such as cut and polished\r agate, onyx, haematite, and lapis-lazuli.", "The goldsmiths did not\r slavishly copy the golden and silver bowls which were imported from the\r Delta; they took their inspiration from the principles displayed in\r the ornamentation of these objects, but they treated the subjects\r after their own manner, grouping them afresh and blending them with\r new designs.", "The intrinsic value of the metal upon which these artistic\r conceptions had been impressed led to their destruction, and among the\r examples which have come down to us I know of no object which can be\r traced to the period of the Egyptian conquest.", "It was Theban art for\r the most part which furnished the Phoenicians with their designs.", "These\r included the lotus, the papyrus, the cow standing in a thicket and\r suckling her

period, without much modification, to the markets\r of the Eastern and Western worlds.", "Indeed, it was natural that they\r should have taken a stereotyped form, when we consider that the\r Phoenicians who employed them held continuous commercial relations\r with the country whence they had come--a country of which, too, they\r recognised the supremacy.", "Egypt in the Ramesside period

intermediary between Egypt\r and the rest of the world had in this traffic a steady source of profit,\r and even in providing Egypt with a single article--for example, bronze,\r or the tin necessary for its preparation--could realise enormous\r profits.", "The people of Tyre and Sidon had been very careful not to\r alienate the good will of such rich customers, and as long as the\r representatives of the Pharaoh held sway in Syria, they had shown\r themselves, if not thoroughly trustworthy vassals, at least less\r turbulent than their neighbours of Arvad and Qodshû.", "Even when

dashed their hopes of finding a\r settlement in Egypt: they never returned thither any more, and the\r current of emigration which had momentarily inclined towards the south,\r now set steadily towards the east, where the large island of Cyprus\r offered an unprotected and more profitable field of adventure.", "We know\r not how far they penetrated into its forests and its interior.", "The\r natives began, at length, under their influence, to despise the customs\r and mode of existence with which they had been previously contented:\r they acquired a taste for pottery rudely decorated

had to strengthen their ancient posts\r or found others--such as Carpasia, Gerynia, and Lapathos on the\r Achæan coast itself, Tamassos near the copper-mines, and a new town,\r Qart-hadashât, which is perhaps only the ancient Citium under a new\r name.* They thus added to their earlier possessions on the island\r regions on its northern side, while the rest either fell gradually into\r the hands of

they could entice on board, or whom they might find defenceless on the\r strand; but they attempted all this with more risk than formerly, and\r with less success.", "The inhabitants of the coast were

found this state of affairs intolerable, and endeavoured to remedy it\r by every means within their power: they followed on the heels of the\r corsairs and adventurers, whatever might be their

with the piratical expeditions\r of the peoples of the coast or with the jealous watchfulness of the\r rulers of the sea, they might have endured the evil, but they had now\r to put up, in addition,

population should expatriate themselves under the leadership of his son\r Tyrsenos.", "Those-who were thus fated to leave their country assembled at\r Smyrna, constructed ships there, and having embarked on board of them\r what was necessary, set sail in quest of a new home.", "After a long\r and devious voyage, they at length disembarked in the country of the\r Umbrians, where they built

knowledge.", "The Etrurians of the historical period were\r      the result of a fusion of several different elements, and\r      there is nothing against the view that the Tursha--one of\r      these elements--should have come from Asia Minor, as\r      Herodotus says.", "Properly understood, the tradition seems\r      well founded, and the details may have been added\r      afterwards, either by the Lydians themselves, or by the\r      Greek historians who collected the Lydian traditions.", "The remaining portions of the nations who had taken part in the attack\r on Egypt--of which several tribes had been planted by Ramses III.", "in\r the Shephelah, from Gaza to Carmel--proceeded in a series of successive\r detachments from Asia Minor and the Ægean Sea to the coasts of Italy\r and of the large islands; the Tursha into that region which was known\r afterwards as Etruria, the Shardana into Sardinia, the Zakkala into\r Sicily, and along with the latter some Pulasati, whose memory is still\r preserved on the northern slope of Etna.", "Fate thus brought the Phonician\r emigrants once more into close contact with their traditional enemies,\r and the hostility which they experienced in their new settlements from\r the latter was among the influences which determined their further\r migration from Italy proper, and from the region occupied by the\r Ligurians between the Arno and the Ebro.", "They had already probably\r reached Sardinia and Corsica, but the majority of their ships had sailed\r to the southward, and having touched at Malta, Gozo, and the small\r islands between Sicily and the Syrtes, had followed the coast-line of\r Africa, until at length they reached the straits of Gribraltar and the\r southern shores of Spain.", "No traces remain of their explorations, or of\r their early establishments in the western Mediterranean, as the towns\r which they are thought--with good reason in most instances--to have\r founded there belong to a much later date.", "Every permanent settlement,\r however, is preceded by a period of exploration and research, which may\r last for only a few years or be prolonged to as many centuries.", "I am\r within the mark, I think, in assuming that Phonician adventurers,\r or possibly even the regular trading ships of Tyre and Sidon, had\r established relations with the semi-barbarous chiefs of Botica as early\r as the XIIth century before our era, that is, at the time when the power\r of Thebes was fading away under the weak rule of the pontiffs of Amon\r and the Tanite Pharaohs.", "The Phoenicians were too much absorbed

impossible, therefore, for them to think of raising armies fit to\r conquer or keep in check the rulers on the Orontes or in Naharaim.", "They\r left this to the races of the interior--the Amorites

contact,\r there was no apparent trace: either the tribes of which they were\r composed had migrated towards the south, or those who had never left\r their native mountains had entered into new combinations and lost even\r the remembrance of their name.", "The Milidu, Tabal (Tubal), and Mushku\r (Meshech) stretched behind each other from east to west on the confines\r of the Tokhma-Su, and still further away other cities of less importance\r contended for the possession of the Upper Saros and the middle region of\r the Halys.", "These peoples, at once poor and warlike, had been attracted,\r like the Hittites of some centuries previous, by the riches accumulated\r in the strongholds of Syria.", "Eevolutions must have been frequent in\r these regions, but our knowledge of them is more a matter of conjecture\r than of actual evidence.", "Towards the year 1170 B.C.", "the Mushku swooped\r down on Kummukh, and made themselves its masters; then pursuing their\r good fortune, they took from the Assyrians the two provinces, Alzi and\r Purukuzzi, which lay not far from the sources of the Tigris and the\r Balikh.*\r \r      * The _Annals of Tiglath-pileser I_.", "place their invasion\r      fifty years before the beginning of his reign.", "Ed.", "Meyer saw\r      a connexion between this and the invasion of the People of\r      the Sea, which took place under Ramses III.", "I think that the\r      invasion of the Mushku was a purely local affair, and had\r      nothing in common with the general catastrophe occasioned by\r      the movement of the Asiatic armies.", "A little later the Kashku, together with some Aramaeans, broke into\r Shubarti, then subject to Assyria, and took possession of a part of it.", "The majority of these invasions had, however, no permanent result: they\r never issued in the establishment of an empire like that of the Khâti,\r capable by its homogeneity of offering a serious resistance to the march\r of a conqueror from the south.", "To sum up the condition of affairs: if\r a redistribution of races had brought about a change in Northern Syria,\r their want of cohesion was no less marked than in the time of the\r Egyptian wars; the first enemy to make an attack upon the frontier of\r one or other of these tribes was sure of victory, and, if he persevered\r in his efforts, could make himself master of as much territory as he\r might choose.", "The Pharaohs had succeeded in welding together their\r African possessions, and their part in the drama of conquest had\r been played long ago; but the cities of the Tigris and the Lower\r Euphrates--Nineveh and Babylon-were ready to enter the lists as soon as\r they felt themselves strong enough to revive their ancient traditions of\r foreign conquest.", "The successors of Agumkakrimê were not more fortunate than he had been\r in attempting to raise Babylon once more to the foremost rank; their\r want of power, their discord, the insubordination and sedition that\r existed among their Cossæan troops, and the almost periodic returns of\r the Theban generals to the banks of the Euphrates, sometimes even to\r those of the Balikh and the Khabur, all seemed to conspire to aggravate\r the helpless state into which Babylon had sunk since the close of the\r dynasty of Uruazagga.", "Elam was pressing upon her eastern, and Assyria\r on her northern frontier, and their kings not only harassed her with\r persistent malignity, but, by virtue of their alliances by marriage with\r her sovereigns, took advantage of every occasion to interfere both\r in domestic and state affairs; they would espouse the cause of some\r pretender during a revolt, they would assume the guardianship of such\r of their relatives as were left widows or minors, and, when the occasion\r presented itself, they took possession of the throne of Bel, or bestowed\r it on one of their creatures.", "Assyria particularly seemed to regard\r Babylon with a deadly hatred.", "The capitals of the two countries were not\r more than some one hundred and eighty-five miles apart, the intervening\r district being a flat and monotonous alluvial plain, unbroken by any\r feature which could serve as a natural frontier.", "The line of demarcation\r usually followed one of the many canals in the narrow strip of land\r between the Euphrates and the Tigris; it then crossed the latter, and\r was formed by one of the rivers draining the Iranian table-land,--either\r the Upper Zab, the Radanu, the Turnat, or some of their ramifications in\r the spurs of the mountain ranges.", "Each of the two states strove by every\r means in its power to stretch its boundary to the farthest limits,\r and to keep it there at all hazards.", "This narrow area was the scene of\r continual war, either between the armies of the two states or those of\r partisans, suspended from time to time by an elaborate treaty which was\r supposed to settle all difficulties, but, as a matter of fact, satisfied\r no one, and left both parties discontented with their lot and jealous of\r each other.", "The concessions made were never of sufficient importance\r to enable the conqueror to crush his rival and regain for himself the\r ancient domain of Khammurabi; his losses, on the other hand, were\r often considerable enough to paralyse his forces, and prevent him from\r extending his border in any other direction.", "When the Egyptians seized\r on Naharaim, Assyria and Babylon each adopted at the outset a different\r attitude towards the conquerors.", "Assyria, which never laid any permanent\r claims to the seaboard provinces of the Mediterranean, was not disposed\r to resent their occupation by Egypt, and desired only to make sure of\r their support or their neutrality.", "The sovereign then ruling Assyria,\r but of whose name we have no record, hastened to congratulate Thûtmosis\r III.", "on his victory at Megiddo, and sent him presents of precious vases,\r slaves, lapis-lazuli, chariots and horses, all of which the Egyptian\r conqueror regarded as so much tribute.", "Babylon, on the other hand, did\r not take action so promptly as Assyria; it was only towards the latter\r years of Thûtmosis that its king, Karaîndash, being hard pressed by the\r Assyrian Assurbelnishishu, at length decided to make a treaty with the\r intruder.*\r \r      * We have no direct testimony in support of this hypothesis,\r      but several important considerations give it probability.", "As\r      no tribute from Babylon is mentioned in the _Annals of\r      Thûtmosis III_., we must place the beginning of the\r      relations between Egypt and Chaldæa at a later date.", "On the\r      other hand, Burnaburiash II., in a letter written to\r      Amenôthes III., cites Karaîndash as the first of _his\r      fathers,_ who had established friendly relations with _the\r      fathers_ of the Pharaoh, a fact which obliges us to place\r      the interchange of presents before the time of Amenôthes\r      III.: as the reigns of Amenôthes II.", "and of Thûtmosis IV.", "were both short, it is probable that these relations began\r      in the latter years of Thûtmosis III.", "The remoteness of Egypt from the Babylonian frontier no doubt relieved\r Karaîndash from any apprehension of an actual invasion by the Pharaohs;\r but there was the possibility of their subsidising some nearer enemy,\r and also of forbidding Babylonish caravans to enter Egyptian provinces,\r and thus crippling Chaldæan commerce.", "Friendly relations, when once\r established, soon necessitated a constant interchange of embassies and\r letters between the Nile and the Euphrates.", "As a matter of fact, the\r Babylonian king could never reconcile himself to the idea that Syria had\r passed out of his hands.", "While pretending to warn the Pharaoh of Syrian\r plots against him,* the Babylonians were employing at the same time\r secret agents, to go from city to city and stir up discontent at\r Egyptian rule, praising the while the great Cosssean king and his\r armies, and inciting to revolt by promises of help never meant to be\r fulfilled.", "Assyria, whose very existence would have been endangered by\r the re-establishment of a Babylonian empire, never missed an opportunity\r of denouncing these intrigues at head-quarters: they warned the royal\r messengers and governors of them, and were constantly contrasting the\r frankness and honesty of their own dealings with the duplicity of their\r rival.", "* This was done by Kurigalzu I., according to a letter\r      addressed by his son Burnaburiash to Amenôthes IV.", "This state of affairs lasted for more than half a century, during which\r time both courts strove to ingratiate themselves in the favour of the\r Pharaoh, each intriguing for the exclusion of the other, by exchanging\r presents with him, by congratulations on his accession, by imploring\r gifts of wrought or unwrought gold, and by offering him the most\r beautiful women of their family for his harem.", "The son of Karaîndash,\r whose name still remains to be discovered, bestowed one of his daughters\r on the young Amenôthes III.: Kallimasin, the sovereign who succeeded\r him, also sent successively two princesses to the same Pharaoh.", "But\r the underlying bitterness and hatred would break through the veneer of\r polite formula and protestations when the petitioner received, as the\r result of his advances, objects of inconsiderable value such as a lord\r might distribute to his vassals, or when he was refused a princess of\r solar blood, or even an Egyptian bride of some feudal house; at such\r times, however, an ironical or haughty epistle from Thebes would recall\r him to a sense of his own inferiority.", "As a fact, the lot of the Cossæan sovereigns does not appear to have\r been a happy one, in spite of the variety and pomposity of the titles\r which they continued to assume.", "They enjoyed but short lives, and we\r know that at least three or four of them--Kallimasin, Burnaburiash I.,\r and Kurigalzu I.", "ascended the throne in succession during the forty\r years that Amenôthes III.", "ruled over Egypt and Syria.*\r \r      * The copy we possess of the Royal Canon of Babylon is\r      mutilated at this point, and the original documents are not\r      sufficiently complete to fill the gap.", "About two or three\r      names are missing after that of Agumkakrimê, and the reigns\r      must have been very short, if indeed, as I think, Agumka-\r      krimî and Karaîndash were both contemporaries of the earlier\r      Pharaohs bearing the name of Thûtmosis.", "The order of the\r      names which have come down to us is not indisputably\r      established.", "The following order appears to me to be the\r      most probable at present:--\r \r      Karaîndash.", "Kallimasin.", "Burnaburiash I.", "Kurigalzu I.", "Burnaburiash II.", "Karakhardash.", "Kadashmankiiarbê I.", "Nazibugas II..", "Kurigalzu II.", "Nazimaruttasii.", "Kadashmanturgu.", "This is, with a slight exception, the classification adopted\r      by Winckler, and that of Hilprecht differs from it only in\r      the intercalation of Kudurturgu and Shagaraktiburiash\r      between Burnaburiash II.", "and Karakhardash.", "Perhaps the rapidity of this succession may have arisen from some\r internal revolution or from family disturbances.", "The Chaldæans of the\r old stock reluctantly rendered obedience to these Cosssean kings,\r and, if we may judge from the name, one at least of these ephemeral\r sovereigns, Kallimasin, appears to have been a Semite, who owed his\r position among the Cossoan princes to some fortunate chance.", "A few\r rare inscriptions stamped on bricks, one or two letters or documents of\r private interest, and some minor objects from widely distant spots, have\r enabled us to ascertain the sites upon which these sovereigns erected\r buildings; Karaîndash restored the temple of Nana at Uruk, Burnaburiash\r and Kurigalzu added to that of Shamash at Larsam, and Kurigalzu took in\r hand that of Sin at Uru.", "We also possess a record of some of their acts\r in the fragments of a document, which a Mnevite scribe of the time of\r Assurbanipal had compiled, or rather jumbled together,* from certain\r Babylonian chronicles dealing with the wars against Assyria and Elam,\r with public treaties, marriages, and family quarrels.", "We learn from\r this, for example, that Burnaburiash I.", "renewed with Buzurassur the\r conventions drawn up between Karaîndash and Assurbelnishishu.", "These\r friendly relations were maintained, apparently, under Kurigalzu I.", "and Assur-nadin-akhi, the son of Buzurassur;** if Kurigalzu built or\r restored the fortress, long called after him Dur-Kurigalzu,*** at one\r of the fords of the Narmalka, it was probably as a precautionary measure\r rather than because of any immediate danger.", "The relations between\r the two powers became somewhat strained when Burnaburiash II.", "and Assuruballît had respectively succeeded to Kurigalzu and\r Assur-nadin-akhi; **** this did not, however, lead to hostilities, and\r the subsequent betrothal of Karakhardash, son of Burnaburiash II., to\r Mubauîtatseruâ, daughter of Assuruballît, tended to restore matters to\r their former condition.", "* This

which Winckler has discovered several\r      blunders.", "** Assur-nadin-akhi I.", "is mentioned in a Tel el-Amarna\r      tablet as being the father of Assuruballît.", "*** This is the present Akerkuf, as is proved by the\r      discovery of bricks bearing the name of Kurigalzu; but\r      perhaps what I have attributed to Kurigalzu I.", "must be\r      referred to the second king of that name.", "**** We infer this from the way in which Burnaburiash speaks\r      of the Assyrians in the correspondence with Amenôthes IV.", "The good will between the two countries became still more pronounced\r when Kadashmankharbê succeeded his father Karakhardash.", "The Cossæan\r soldiery had taken umbrage at his successor and had revolted,\r assassinated Kadashmankharbê, and proclaimed king in his stead a man\r of obscure origin named Nazibùgash.", "Assuruballît, without a moments\r hesitation, took the side of his new relatives; he crossed the frontier,\r killed Nazibugash, and restored the throne to his sisters child,\r Kurigalzu II., the younger.", "The young king, who was still a minor at\r his accession, appears to have met with no serious difficulties; at any\r rate, none were raised by his Assyrian cousins, Belnirârî I.", "and his\r successor Budîlu.*\r \r      * The _Synchronous History_ erroneously places the events of\r      the reign of Rammân-nirâri in that of Belnirârî.", "The order\r      of succession of Buzurassur, Assuruballît, Belnirârî, and\r      Budîlu, has been established by the bricks of Kalah-Shergât.", "Towards the close of his reign, however, revolts broke out, and it was\r only by sustained efforts that he was able to restore order in Babylon,\r Sippara, and the Country of the Sea.", "While the king was in the midst of\r these difficulties, the Elamites took advantage of his troubles to\r steal from him a portion of his territory, and their king, Khurbatila,\r challenged him to meet his army near Dur-Dungi.", "Kurigalzu accepted the\r challenge, gained a decisive victory, took his adversary prisoner, and\r released him only on receiving as ransom a province beyond the Tigris;\r he even entered Susa, and, from among other trophies of past wars,\r resumed possession of an agate tablet belonging to Dungi, which the\r veteran Kudurnakhunta had stolen from the temple of Nipur nearly\r a thousand years previously.", "This victory was followed by the\r congratulations of most of his neighbours, with the exception of\r Bammân-nirâri II., who had succeeded Budîlu in Assyria, and probably\r felt some jealousy or uneasiness at the news.", "He attacked the Cossæans,\r and overthrew them at Sugagi, on the banks of the Salsallât; their\r losses were considerable, and Kurigalzu could only obtain peace by the\r cession to Assyria of a strip of territory the entire length of the\r north-west frontier, from the confines of the Shubari country, near\r the sources of the Khabur, to the suburbs of Babylon itself.", "Nearly the\r whole of Mesopotamia thus changed hands at one stroke, but Babylon had\r still more serious losses to suffer.", "Nazimaruttash, who attempted to\r wipe out the disaster sustained by his father Kurigalzu, experienced two\r crushing defeats, one at Kar-Ishtar and the other near Akarsallu, and\r the treaty which he subsequently signed was even more humiliating for\r his country than the preceding one.", "All that part of the Babylonian\r domain which lay nearest to Nineveh was ceded to the Assyrians, from\r Pilaski on the right bank of the Tigris to the province of Lulumê in\r the Zagros mountains.", "It would appear that the Cossæan tribes who had\r remained in their native country, took advantage of these troublous\r times to sever all connection with their fellow-countrymen established\r in the cities of the plain; for we find them henceforward carrying on a\r petty warfare for their own profit, and leading an entirely independent\r life.", "The descendants of Gandish, deprived of territories in the north,\r repulsed in the east, and threatened in the south by the nations of\r the Persian Gulf, never recovered their former ascendency, and their\r authority slowly declined during the century which followed these\r events.", "Their downfall brought about the decadence of the cities over\r which they had held sway; and the supremacy which Babylon had exercised\r for a thousand years over the countries of the Euphrates passed into the\r hands of the Assyrian kings.", "Assyria itself was but a poor and insignificant country when compared\r with her rival.", "It occupied, on each side of the middle course of the\r Tigris, the territory lying between the 35th and 37th parallels of\r latitude.*\r \r      * These are approximately the limits of the first Assyrian\r      empire, as given by the monuments; from the Persian epoch\r      onwards, the name was applied to the whole course of the\r      Tigris as far as the mountain district.", "The ancient\r      orthography of the name is Aushâr.", "It was bounded on the east by the hills and mountain ranges running\r parallel to the Zagros Chain--Gebel Guar, Gebel Gara, Zerguizavân-dagh,\r and Baravân-dagh, with their rounded monotonous limestone ridges, scored\r by watercourses and destitute of any kind of trees.", "On the north it\r was hemmed in by the spurs of the Masios, and bounded on the east by an\r undefined line running from Mount Masios to the slopes of Singar,\r and from these again to the Chaldæan plain; to the south the frontier\r followed the configuration of the table-land and the curve of the low\r cliffs, which in prehistoric times had marked the limits of the Persian\r Gulf; from here the boundary was formed on the left side of the Tigris\r by one of its tributaries, either the Lower Zab or the Badanu.", "The\r territory thus enclosed formed a compact and healthy district: it was\r free from extremes of temperature arising from height or latitude, and\r the relative character and fertility of its soil depended on the absence\r or presence of rivers.", "The eastern part of Assyria was well watered by\r the streams and torrents which drained the Iranian plateau and the lower\r mountain chains which ran parallel to it.", "The beds of these rivers are\r channelled so deeply in the alluvial soil, that it is necessary to stand\r on the very edge of their banks to catch a sight of their silent and\r rapid waters; and it is only in the spring or early summer, when they\r are swollen by the rains and melting snow, that they spread over the\r adjacent country.", "As soon as the inundation is over, a vegetation of the\r intensest green springs up, and in a few days the fields and meadows are\r covered with a luxuriant and fragrant carpet of verdure.", "This brilliant\r growth is, however, short-lived, for the heat of the sun dries it up as\r quickly as it appears, and even the corn itself is in danger of being\r burnt up before reaching maturity.", "To obviate such a disaster, the\r Assyrians had constructed a network of canals and ditches, traces of\r which are in many places still visible, while a host of _shadufs_\r placed along their banks facilitated irrigation in the dry seasons.", "The\r provinces supplied with water in this manner enjoyed a fertility which\r passed into a proverb, and was well known among the ancients; they\r yielded crops of cereals which rivalled those of Babylonia, and included\r among their produce wheat, barley, millet, and sesame.", "But few olive\r trees were cultivated, and the dates were of inferior quality; indeed,\r in the Greek period, these fruits were only used for fattening pigs and\r domestic animals.", "The orchards contained the pistachio, the apple, the\r pomegranate, the apricot, the vine, the almond, and the fig, and, in\r addition to the essences common to both Syria and Egypt, the country\r produced cédrats of a delicious scent which were supposed to be an\r antidote to all kinds of poisons.", "Assyria was not well wooded, except in\r the higher valleys, where willows and poplars bordered the rivers, and\r sycamores, beeches, limes, and plane trees abounded, besides several\r varieties of pines and oaks, including a dwarf species of the latter,\r from whose branches manna was obtained.", "[Illustration: 143.jpg THE 1ST ASSYRIAN EMPIRE--MAP]\r \r This is a saccharine substance, which is deposited in small lumps, and\r is found in greater abundance during wet years and especially on foggy\r days.", "When fresh, it has an agreeable taste and is pleasant to eat;\r but as it will not keep in its natural state, the women prepare it for\r exportation by dissolving it in boiling water, and evaporating it to a\r sweetish paste, which has more or less purgative, qualities.", "The aspect\r of the country changes after crossing the Tigris westward.", "The slopes of\r Mount Masios are everywhere furrowed with streams, which feed the Khabur\r and its principal affluent, the Kharmis;* woods become more frequent,\r and the valleys green and shady.", "* The Kharmis is the Mygdonios of Greek geographers, the\r      Hirmâs of the Arabs; the latter name may be derived from\r      Kharmis, or it may be that it merely presents a fortuitous\r      resemblance to it.", "The plains extending southwards, however, contain, like those of the\r Euphrates, beds of gypsum in the sub-soil, which render the water\r running through them brackish, and prevent the growth of vegetation.", "The effects of volcanic action are evident on the surface of these\r great steppes; blocks of basalt pierce through the soil, and near the\r embouchure of the Kharmis, a cone, composed of a mass of lava, cinders,\r and scorial, known as the Tell-Kôkab, rises abruptly to a height of\r 325 feet.", "The mountain chain of Singar, which here reaches its western\r termination, is composed of a long ridge of soft white limestone, and\r seems to have been suddenly thrown up in one of the last geological\r upheavals which affected this part of the country: in some places it\r resembles a perpendicular wall, while in others it recedes in natural\r terraces which present the appearance of a gigantic flight of steps.", "The\r summit is often wooded, and the spurs covered with vineyards and fields,\r which flourish vigorously in the vicinity of streams; when these fail,\r however, the table-land resumes its desolate aspect, and stretches\r in bare and sandy undulations to the horizon, broken only where it\r is crossed by the Thartar, the sole river in this region which is not\r liable to be dried up, and whose banks may be traced by the scanty line\r of vegetation which it nourishes.", "[Illustration: 145.jpg THE VOLCANIC CONE OF KÔKAB]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the cut in Layard.", "In a country thus unequally favoured by nature, the towns are\r necessarily distributed in a seemingly arbitrary fashion.", "Most of them\r are situated on the left bank of the Tigris, where the fertile nature\r of the soil enables it to support a dense population.", "They were all\r flourishing centres of population, and were in close proximity to each\r other, at all events during the centuries of Assyrian hegemony.*\r \r      * We find, for example, in the inscription of Bavian, a long\r      enumeration of towns and villages situated almost within the\r      suburbs of Nineveh, on the banks of the Khôser.", "Three of them soon eclipsed their rivals in political and religious\r importance; these were Kalakh and Nina on the Tigris, and Arbaîlu,\r lying beyond the Upper Zab, in the broken plain which is a continuation\r eastwards of the first spurs of the Zagros.* On the right bank, however,\r we find merely some dozen cities and towns, scattered about in places\r where there was a supply of water sufficient to enable the inhabitants\r to cultivate the soil; as, for example, Assur on the banks of the Tigris\r itself, Singara near the sources of the Thartar, and Nazibina near those\r of the Kharmis, at the foot of the Masios.", "These cities were not all\r under the rule of one sovereign when Thûtmosis III.", "appeared in Syria,\r for the Egyptian monuments mention, besides the kingdom of Assyria, that\r of Singara** and Araphka in the upper basin of the Zab.***\r \r

III.", "Schrader was doubtful as to its\r      existence, but one of its kings is mentioned in a letter\r      from the King of Alasia to Amenôthes IV.; according to\r      Niebuhr, the state of which Singara was the capital must\r      have been identical, at all events at one period, with the\r      Mitanni of the Egyptian texts.", "*** The Arapakha of the Egyptian monuments has been\r      identified with the Arrapakhitis of the Greeks.", "Assyria, however, had already asserted her supremacy over this corner of\r Asia, and the remaining princes, even if they were not mere vicegerents\r depending on her king, were not strong enough in wealth and extent\r of territory to hold their own against her, since she was undisputed\r mistress of Assur, Arbeles, Kalakh, and Nineveh, the most important\r cities of the plain.", "Assur covered a considerable area, and the\r rectangular outline formed by the remains of its walls is still\r discernible on the surface of the soil.", "Within the circuit of the\r city rose a mound, which the ancient builders had transformed, by\r the addition of masses of brickwork, into a nearly square platform,\r surmounted by the usual palace, temple, and ziggurat; it was enclosed\r within a wall of squared stone, the battlements of which remain to the\r present day.* The whole pile was known as the Ekharsagkurkurra, or the\r House of the terrestrial mountain, the sanctuary in whose decoration\r all the ancient sovereigns had vied with one another, including\r Samsirammân I.", "and Irishum, who were merely vicegerents dependent upon\r Babylon.", "It was dedicated to Anshar, that duplicate of Anu who had\r led the armies of heaven in the struggle with Tiâmat; the name Anshar,\r softened into Aushar, and subsequently into Ashshur, was first applied\r to the town and then to the whole country.**\r \r      * Ainsworth states the circumference of the principal mound\r      of Kalah-Shergât to be 4685 yards, which would make it one\r      of the most extensive ruins in the whole country.", "** Another name of the town in later times was Palbêki, the\r      town of the old empire, the ancient capital, or Shauru.", "Many Assyriologists believe that the name Ashur, anciently\r      written Aushâr, signified the plain at the edge of the\r      water; and that it must have been applied to the town\r      before being applied to the country and the god.", "Others, on\r      the contrary, think, with more reason, that it was the god\r      who gave his name to the town and the country; they make a\r      point of the very ancient play of words, which in Assyria\r      itself attributed the meaning good god to the word Ashur.", "Jensen was the first to state that Ashur was the god Anshâr\r      of the account of the creation.", "The god himself was a deity of light, usually represented under the form\r of an armed man, wearing the tiara and having the lower half of his body\r concealed by a feathered disk.", "He was supposed to hover continually\r over the world, hurling fiery darts at the enemies of his people, and\r protecting his kingly worshippers under the shadow of his wings.", "Their\r wars were his wars, and he was with them in the thick of the attack,\r placing himself in the front rank with the soldiery,* so that when he\r gained the victory, the bulk of the spoil--precious metals, gleanings\r of the battle-field, slaves and productive lands--fell to his share.", "The\r gods of the vanquished enemy, moreover, were, like their princes, forced\r to render him homage.", "In the person of the king he took their statues\r prisoners, and shut them up in his sanctuary; sometimes he would engrave\r his name upon their figures and send them back to their respective\r temples, where the sight of them would remind their worshippers of his\r own omnipotence.** The goddess associated with him as his wife had given\r her name, Nina, to Nineveh,*** and was, as the companion of

of the pictures, for instance, representing the\r      assault of a town, we see a small figure of the god, hurling\r      darts against the enemy.", "The inscriptions also state that\r      the

when the Chaldæans revolted, and named Rammânshumusur king.", "Now, the Babylonian Canon gives us the following reigns for\r      this epoch: Bibeiashu _8 years_, Belnadînshumu _1 year 6\r      months_, Kadashmankharbe _1 year 6 months_, Rammânnadînshumu\r      _6 years_, Rammânshumusur _30 years,_ or _9 years_ between\r      the end of the reign of Bibeiashu and the beginning of that\r      of Rammânshumusur, instead of the _7 years_ given us by the\r      _Pinches Chronicle_ for the length of the reign of Tukulti-\r      ninip at Babylon.", "If we reckon, as the only documents known\r      require us to do, seven years from the beginning of the\r      reign of Rammânshumusur to the date of the taking of\r      Babylon, we are forced to admit that this took place in the\r      reign of Kadashmankharbe IL, and, consequently, that the\r      passage in the _Synchronous History_, in which mention is\r      made of Bibeiashu, must be interpreted as I have done in the\r      text, by the hypothesis of a war prior to that in which\r      Babylon fell, which was followed by a treaty between this\r      prince and the King of Assyria.", "The peace thus concluded might have lasted

palace and the temples, dragged the statue of\r Merodach from its sanctuary and carried it off into Assyria, together\r with the badges of supreme power; then, after appointing governors of\r his own in the various towns, he returned to Kalakh, laden with booty;\r he led captive with him several members of the royal family--among\r others, Bammânshumusur, the lawful successor of Bibeiashu.", "This first conquest of Chaldæa did not, however, produce any lasting\r results.", "The fall of Babylon did not necessarily involve the subjection\r of the whole country, and the cities of the south showed a bold front to\r the foreign intruder, and remained faithful to Kadashmankharbe; on the\r death of the latter, some months after his defeat, they hailed as king a\r certain Bammânshumnadîn, who by some means or other had made his escape\r from captivity.", "Bammânshumnadîn proved himself a better man than his\r predecessors; when Kidinkhutrutash, never dreaming, apparently, that he\r would meet with any serious resistance, came to claim his share of\r the spoil, he defeated him near Ishin, drove him out of the districts\r recently occupied by the Elamites, and so effectually retrieved his\r fortunes in this direction, that he was able to concentrate his whole\r attention on what was going on in the north.", "The effects of his victory\r soon became apparent: the nobles of Akkad and Karduniash declined to pay\r homage to their Assyrian governors, and, ousting them from the offices\r to which they had been appointed, restored Babylon to the independence\r which it had lost seven years previously.", "Tukulti-ninip paid dearly\r for his incapacity to retain his conquests: his son Assurnazirpal I.", "conspired with the principal officers, deposed him from the throne, and\r confined him in the fortified palace of Kar-Tukulti-ninip, which he\r had built not far from Kalakh, where he soon after contrived his\r assassination.", "About this time Rammânshumnadîn disappears, and we can\r only suppose that the disasters of these last years had practically\r annihilated the Cossæan dynasty, for Rammânshu-musur, who was a prisoner\r in Assyria, was chosen as his successor.", "The monuments tell us nothing\r definite of the troubles which next befell the two kingdoms: we seem to\r gather, however, that Assyria became the scene of civil wars, and\r that the sons of Tukulti-ninip fought for the crown among themselves.", "Tukultiassurbel, who gained the upper hand at the end of six years, set\r Raminân-shumusur at liberty, probably with the view of purchasing\r the support of the Chaldæans, but he did not succeed in restoring his\r country to the position it had held under Shalmaneser and Tukulti-ninip\r I.", "The history of Assyria presents a greater number of violent contrasts\r and extreme vicissitudes than that of any other Eastern people in the\r earliest times.", "No sooner had the Assyrians arrived, thanks to the\r ceaseless efforts of five or six generations, at the very summit of\r their ambition, than some incompetent, or perhaps merely unfortunate,\r king appeared on the scene, and lost in a few years all the ground\r which had been gained at the cost of such tremendous exertions: then\r the subject races would rebel, the neighbouring peoples would pluck up\r courage and reconquer the provinces which they had surrendered, till the\r dismembered empire gradually shrank back to its original dimensions.", "As\r the fortunes of Babylon rose, those of Nineveh suffered a corresponding\r depression: Babylon soon became so powerful that Eammânshumusur was able\r to adopt a patronising tone in his relations with Assur-nirâri I.", "and\r Nabodaînâni, the descendants of Tukultiassurbel, who at one time shared\r the throne together.*\r \r      * All that we know of these two kings is contained in the\r      copy, executed in the time of Assurbanipal, of a letter\r      addressed to them by Eammânshumusur.", "They have been placed,\r      at one time or another, either at the beginning of Assyrian\r      history before Assurbelnishishu, or after Tigiath-pileser\r      I., about the XIth or Xth, or even the VIIIth century before\r

though he fell in the decisive engagement,\r yet Bammân-shumusur perished with him, and the two states were thus\r simultaneously left rulerless.", "Milishikhu succeeded Bammânshumusur,\r and Ninipahalesharra filled the place of Belkudurusur; the disastrous\r invasion of Assyria by the Chaldæans, and their subsequent retreat, at\r length led to an armistice, which, while it afforded evidence of the\r indisputable superiority of Milishikhu, proved no less plainly the\r independence of his rival.", "Mero-dachabaliddina I.", "replaced Milishikhu,\r Zamâniashu-middin followed Merodachabaliddina: Assurdân I., son of\r Ninipahalesharra, broke the treaty, captured the towns of Zabân, Irrîa,\r and Akarsallu, and succeeded in retaining them.", "The advantage thus\r gained was but a slight one, for these provinces lying between the two\r Zabs had long been subject to Assyria, and had been wrested from her\r since the days of Tukulti-ninip: however, it broke the run of ill luck\r which seemed to have pursued her so relentlessly, and opened the way for\r more important victories.", "This was the last Cossæan war; at any rate,\r the last of which we find any mention in

centuries to subjugate her immediate neighbours should\r afterwards overcome all the states on the Mediterranean seaboard with\r such magnificent ease.", "In much the same way the ceaseless struggles of\r Assyria with the Chaldaeans, and with the mountain tribes of the\r Zagros Chain, were unconsciously preparing her for those lightning-like\r campaigns in which she afterwards overthrew all the civilized nations\r of the Bast one after another.", "It was only at the cost of unparalleled\r exertions that she succeeded in solidly welding together the various\r provinces within her borders, and in kneading (so to speak) the many\r and diverse elements of her vast population into one compact mass,\r containing in itself all that was needful for its support, and able to\r bear the strain of war for several years at time without giving way, and\r rich enough in men and horses to provide the material for an effective\r army without excessive impoverishment of her trade or agriculture.",

slopes of Singar, or in the valleys to the east of Mossul.", "The figures on the monuments are tall and straight, broad-shouldered and\r wide in the hips, the arms well developed, the legs robust, with good\r substantial feet.", "The swell of the muscles on the naked limbs is perhaps\r exaggerated, but this very exaggeration of the modelling suggests\r the vigour of the model; it is a heavier, more rustic type than the\r Egyptian, promising greater strength and power of resistance, and in so\r far an indisputable superiority in the great game of war.", "The head is\r somewhat small, the forehead low and flat, the eyebrows heavy, the eye\r of a bold almond shape, with heavy lids, the nose aquiline, and full at\r the tip, with wide nostrils terminating in a hard, well-defined curve;\r the lips are thick and full, the chin bony, while the face is framed by\r the coarse dark wavy hair and beard, which fell in curly masses over the\r nape of the neck and the breast.", "The expression of the face is rarely\r of an amiable and smiling type, such as we find in the statues of the\r Theban period or in those of the Memphite empire, nor, as a matter of\r fact, did the Assyrian pride himself on the gentleness of his manners:\r he did not overflow with love for his fellow-man, as the Egyptian made\r a pretence of doing; on the contrary, he was stiff-necked and proud,\r without pity for others or for himself, hot-tempered and quarrelsome\r like his cousins of Chaldæa, but less turbulent and more capable of\r strict discipline.", "It mattered not whether he had come into the world in\r one of the wretched cabins of a fellah village, or in the palace of\r one of the great nobles; he was a born soldier, and his whole education\r tended to develop in him the first qualities of the soldier--temperance,\r patience, energy, and unquestioning obedience: he was enrolled in an\r army which was always on a war footing, commanded by the god Assur, and\r under Assur, by the king, the vicegerent and representative of the god.", "His life was shut in by the same network of legal restrictions which\r confined that of the Babylonians, and all its more important events\r had to be recorded on tablets of clay; the wording of contracts, the\r formalities of marriage or adoption, the status of bond and free, the\r rites of the dead and funeral ceremonies, had either remained identical\r with those in use during the earliest years of the cities of the Lower\r Euphrates, or differed from them only in their less important details.", "The royal and municipal governments levied the same taxes, used the\r same procedure, employed the same magistrates, and the grades of their\r hierarchy were the same, with one exception.", "After the king, the highest\r office was filled by a soldier, the _tartan_ who saw to the recruiting\r of the troops, and led them in time of war, or took command of the\r staff-corps whenever the sovereign himself deigned to appear on the\r scene of action.*\r \r      * We can determine the rank occupied, by the _tartanu_ at\r      court by the positions they occupy in the lists of eponymous\r      _limmu_: they invariably come next after the king--a fact\r      which was noticed many years ago.", "The more influential of these functionaries bore, in addition to their\r other titles, one of a special nature, which, for the space of one year,\r made its holder the most conspicuous man in the country; they became\r _limmu_, and throughout their term of office their names appeared on\r all official documents.", "The Chaldæans distinguished the various years of\r each reign by a reference to some event which had taken place in\r each; the Assyrians named them after the _limmu_.* The king was the\r _ex-officio limmu_ for the year following that of his accession, then\r after him the _tartan_, then the ministers and governors of provinces\r and cities in an order which varied little from reign to reign.", "The\r names of the _limmu_, entered in registers and tabulated--just as,\r later on, were those of the Greek archons and Roman consuls--furnished\r the annalists with a rigid chronological system, under which the facts\r of history might be arranged with certainty.**\r \r      * According to Delitzsch, the term _limu,_ or _limmu_, meant\r      at first any given period, then later more especially the\r      year during which a magistrate filled his office; in the\r      opinion of most other Assyriologists it referred to the\r      magistrate himself as eponymous archon.", "** The first list of _limmu_ was discovered by H.", "Rawlinson.", "The portions which have been preserved extend from the year\r      893 to the year 666 B.C.", "without a break.", "In the periods\r      previous and subsequent to this we have only names scattered\r      here and there which it has not been possible to classify:\r      the earliest _limmu_ known at present flourished under\r      Rammân-nirâri I., and was named Mukhurilâni.", "Three different\r      versions of the canon have como down to us.", "In the most\r      important one the names of the eponymous officials are\r      written one after another without titles or any mention of\r      important events; in the other two, the titles of each\r      personage, and any important occurrences which took place\r      during his year of office, are entered after the name.", "The king still retained the sacerdotal attributes with which Cossæan\r monarchs had been invested from the earliest times, but contact with the\r Egyptians had modified the popular conception of his personality.", "His\r subjects were no longer satisfied to regard him merely as a man superior\r to his fellow-men; they had come to discover something of the divine\r nature in him, and sometimes identified him--not with Assur, the master\r of all things, who occupied a position too high above the pale of\r ordinary humanity--but with one of the demi-gods of the second rank,\r Shamash, the Sun, the deity whom the Pharaohs pretended to represent in\r flesh and blood here below.", "His courtiers, therefore, went as far as to\r call him Sun when they addressed him, and he himself adopted this title\r in his inscriptions.*\r \r      * Nebuchadrezzar I.", "of Babylon assumes the title of _Shamash\r      mati-shu_, the Sun of his country, and Hilprecht rightly\r      sees in this expression a trace of Egyptian influences;\r      later on, Assurnazirpal, King of Assyria similarly describes\r      himself as _Shamshu kishshat nishi_, the Sun of all\r      mankind. Tiele is of opinion that these expressions do not\r      necessarily point to any theory of the actual incarnation of\r      the god, as was the case in Egypt, but that they may be mere\r      rhetorical figures.", "Formerly he had only attained this apotheosis after death, later on he\r was permitted to aspire to it during his lifetime.", "The Chaldæans adopted\r the same attitude, and in both countries the royal authority shone with\r the borrowed lustre of divine omnipotence.", "With these exceptions life\r at court remained very much the same as it had been; at Nineveh, as at\r Babylon, we find harems filled with foreign princesses, who had either\r been carried off as hostages from the country of a defeated enemy, or\r amicably obtained from their parents.", "In time of war, the command of the\r troops and the dangers of the battle-field; in time of peace, a host\r of religious ceremonies and judicial or administrative duties, left but\r little leisure to the sovereign who desired to perform conscientiously\r all that was required of him.", "His chief amusement lay in the hunting of\r wild beasts: the majority of the princes who reigned over Assyria had a\r better right than even Amenôthes III.", "himself to boast of the hundreds\r of lions which they had slain.", "They set out on these hunting expeditions\r with quite a small army of charioteers and infantry, and were often away\r several days at a time, provided urgent business did not require their\r presence in the palace.", "They started their quarry with the help of large\r dogs, and followed it over hill and dale till they got within bowshot:\r if it was but slightly wounded and turned on them, they gave it the\r finishing stroke with their lances without dismounting.", "[Illustration: 178.jpg A LION-HUNT]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a bas-relief in the British Museum.", "Occasionally, however, they were obliged to follow their prey into\r places where horses could not easily penetrate; then a hand-to-hand\r conflict was inevitable.", "The lion would rise on its hind quarters and\r endeavour to lay its pursuer low with a stroke of its mighty paw, but\r only to fall pierced to the heart by his lance or sword.", "[Illustration: 179.jpg LION TRANSFIXED BY AN ARROW]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a bas-relief in the British Museum.", "This kind of encounter demanded great presence of mind and steadiness of\r hand; the Assyrians were, therefore, trained to it from their youth\r up, and no hunter was permitted to engage in these terrible encounters\r without long preliminary practice.", "Seeing the lion as they did so\r frequently, and at such close quarters, they came to know it quite as\r well as the Egyptians, and their sculptors reproduce it with a realism\r and technical skill which have been rarely equalled in modern times.", "But while the Theban artist generally represents it in an attitude of\r repose, the Assyrians prefer to show it in violent action in all the\r various attitudes which it assumes during a struggle, either crouching\r as it prepares to spring, or fully extended in the act of leaping;\r sometimes it rears into an upright position, with arched back, gaping\r jaws, and claws protruded, ready to bite or strike its foe; at others\r it writhes under a spear-thrust, or rolls over and over in its dying\r agonies.", "In one instance, an arrow has pierced the skull of a male lion,\r crashing through the frontal bone a little above the left eyebrow, and\r protrudes obliquely to the right between his teeth: under the shock of\r the blow he has risen on his hind legs, with contorted spine, and beats\r the air with his fore paws, his head thrown back as though to free\r himself of the fatal shaft.", "Not far from him the lioness lies stretched\r out upon its back in the rigidity of death.", "[Illustration: 180.jpg PAINTINGS OF CHAIRS]\r \r The rimu, or urus, was, perhaps, even a more formidable animal to\r encounter than any of the _felido_, owing to the irresistible fury of\r his attack.", "No one would dare, except in a case of dire necessity, to\r meet him on foot.", "The loose flowing robes which the king and the nobles\r never put aside--not even in such perilous pastimes as these--were ill\r fitted for the quick movements required to avoid the attack of such an\r animal, and those who were unlucky enough to quit their chariot ran a\r terrible risk of being gored or trodden underfoot in the encounter.", "It\r was the custom, therefore, to attack the beast by arrows, and to keep it\r at a distance.", "If the animal were able to come up with its pursuer, the\r latter endeavoured to seize it by the horn at the moment when it lowered\r its head, and to drive his dagger into its neck.", "If the blow were\r adroitly given it severed the spinal cord, and the beast fell in a heap\r as if struck by lightning.", "A victory over such animals was an occasion\r for rejoicing, and solemn thanks were offered to Assur and Ishtar, the\r patrons of the chase, at the usual evening sacrifice.", "[Illustration: 181.jpg A UBUS HUNT]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a

alongside them, holding his bow in his left\r hand.", "While the singers intoned the hymn of thanksgiving to the\r accompaniment of the harp, the monarch took the bowl of sacred wine,\r touched his lips with it, and then poured a portion of the contents on\r the heads of the victims.", "A detailed account of each hunting exploit was\r preserved for posterity either in inscriptions or on bas-reliefs.*\r \r      * In the _Annals of Tiglath-pileser I._ the king counts the\r      number of his victims: 4 urus, 10 male elephants, 120 lions\r      slain in single combat on foot, 800 lions killed by arrows\r      let fly from his chariot.", "In the _Annals of Assurnazirpal,_\r      the king boasts of having slain 30 elephants, 250 urus, and\r      370 lions.", "The chase was in those days of great service to the rural population;\r the kings also considered it to be one of the duties attached to their\r office, and on a level with their obligation to make war on neighbouring\r

people destroyed, when the Assyrian army had remained merely a week or\r a fortnight within its territory, had burnt some half-dozen fortified\r towns, and taken two or three thousand prisoners.*\r \r      * For example, Tiglath-pileser I.", "conquers the Kummukli in\r      the first year of his reign, burning, destroying, and\r      depopulating the towns, and massacring the remainder of the\r      Kummukh who had taken refuge in the mountains, after which,\r      in his second campaign, he again pillages, burns, destroys,\r      and depopulates the towns, and again massacres the remainder\r      of the inhabitants hiding in the mountains.", "He makes the\r      same statements with regard to most of the other countries\r      and peoples conquered by him, but we find them reappearing\r      with renewed vigour on the scene, soon after their supposed\r      destruction.", "If we were to accept implicitly all that is recorded of the Assyrian\r exploits in Naîri or the Taurus, we should be led to believe that for\r at least half a century the valleys of the Upper Tigris and Middle\r Euphrates were transformed into a desert; each time, however, that they\r are subsequently mentioned on the occasion of some fresh expedition,\r they appear once more covered with thriving cities and a vigorous\r population, whose generals offer an obstinate resistance to the\r invaders.", "We are, therefore, forced to admit that the majority of these\r expeditions must be regarded as mere raids.", "The population, disconcerted\r by a sudden attack, would take refuge in the woods or on the mountains,\r carrying with them their gods, whom they thus preserved from captivity,\r together with a portion of their treasures and cattle; but no sooner had\r the invader retired, than they descended once more into the plain and\r returned to their usual occupations.", "The Assyrian victories thus rarely\r produced the decisive results which are claimed for them; they almost\r always left the conquered people with sufficient energy and resources\r to enable them to resume the conflict after a brief interval, and the\r supremacy which the suzerain claimed as a result of his conquests was of\r the most ephemeral nature.", "A revolt would suffice to shake it, while a\r victory would be almost certain to destroy it, and once more reduce the\r empire to the limits of Assyria proper.", "Tukultiabalesharra, familiar to us under the name of Tiglath-pileser,*\r is the first of the great warrior-kings of Assyria to stand out before\r us with any definite individuality.", "* Tiglath-pileser is one of the transcriptions given in the\r      LXX.", "for the Hebrew version of the name: it signifies, The\r      child of Esharra is my strength. By the child of Esharra\r       the Assyrians, like the Chaldæans, understood the child of\r      Ninib.", "We find him, in the interval between two skirmishes, engaged in hunting\r lions or in the pursuit of other wild beasts, and we see him lavishing\r offerings on the gods and enriching their temples with the spoils of\r his victories; these, however, were not the normal occupations of this\r sovereign, for peace with him was merely an interlude in a reign of\r conflict.", "He led all his expeditions in person, undeterred by any\r consideration of fatigue or danger, and scarcely had he returned from\r one arduous campaign, than he proceeded to sketch the plan of that for\r the following year; in short, he reigned only to wage war.", "His father,\r Assurîshishi, had bequeathed him not only a prosperous kingdom, but a\r well-organised army, which he placed in the field without delay.", "During\r the fifty years since the Mushku, descending through the gorges of the\r Taurus, had invaded the Alzi and the Puru-kuzzi, Assyria had not only\r lost possession of all the countries bordering the left bank of the\r Euphrates, but the whole of Kummukh had withdrawn its allegiance from\r her, and had ceased to pay tribute.", "Tiglath-pileser had ascended the\r throne only a few weeks ere he quitted Assur, marched rapidly across\r Eastern Mesopotamia by the usual route, through Singar and Nisib, and\r climbing the chain of the Kashiara, near Mardîn, bore down into the very\r heart of Kummukh, where twenty thousand Mushku, under the command of\r five kings, resolutely awaited him.", "He repulsed them in the very first\r engagement, and pursued them hotly over hill and vale, pillaging the\r fields, and encircling the towns with trophies of human heads taken\r from the prisoners who had fallen into his hands; the survivors, to the\r number of six thousand, laid down their arms, and were despatched to\r Assyria.*\r \r      * The king, starting from Assur, must have followed the\r      route through Sindjar, Nisib, Mardîn, and Diarbekîr--a road\r      used later by the Romans, and still in existence at the\r      present day.", "As he did not penetrate that year as far as the\r      provinces of Alzi and Purukuzzi, he must have halted at the\r      commencement of the mountain district, and have beaten the\r      allies in the plain of Kuru-tchaî, before Diarbekîr, in the\r      neighbourhood of the Tigris.", "The Kummukh contingents, however, had been separated in the rout from\r the Mushku, and had taken refuge beyond the Euphrates, near to the\r fortress of Shirisha, where they imagined themselves in safety behind a\r rampart of mountains and forests.", "Tiglath-pileser managed, by cutting\r a road for his foot-soldiers and chariots, to reach their retreat: he\r stormed the place without apparent difficulty, massacred the defenders,\r and then turning upon the inhabitants of Kurkhi,* who were on their way\r to reinforce the besieged, drove their soldiers into the Nâmi, whose\r waters carried the corpses down to the Tigris.", "One of their princes,\r Kilite-shub, son of Kaliteshub-Sarupi, had been made prisoner during\r the action.", "Tiglath-pileser sent him, together with his wives, children,\r treasures, and gods,** to share the captivity of the Mushku; then\r retracing his steps, he crossed over to the right bank of the Tigris,\r and attacked the stronghold of Urrakhinas which crowned the summit of\r Panâri.", "* The country of the Kurkhi appears to have included at this\r      period the provinces lying between the Sebbeneh-Su and the\r      mountains of Djudî, probably a portion of the Sophene, the\r      Anzanone and the Gordyenc of classical authors.", "** The vanquished must have crossed the Tigris below\r      Diarbekîr and have taken refuge beyond Mayafarrikîn, so that\r      Shirisha must be sought for between the Silvan-dagh and the\r      Ak-dagh, in the basin of the Batman-tchai, the present Nâmi.", "The people, terror-stricken by the fate of their neighbours, seized\r their idols and hid themselves within the thickets like a flock of\r birds.", "Their chief, Shaditeshub, son of Khâtusaru,* ventured from out of\r his hiding-place to meet the Assyrian conqueror, and prostrated himself\r at his feet.", "He delivered over his sons and the males of his family\r as hostages, and yielded up all his possessions in gold and copper,\r together with a hundred and twenty slaves and cattle of all kinds;\r Tiglath-pileser thereupon permitted him to keep his principality under\r the suzerainty of Assyria, and such of his allies as followed his\r example obtained a similar concession.", "The king consecrated the tenth\r of the spoil thus received to the use of his god Assur and also to\r Rammân;** but before returning to his capital, he suddenly resolved to\r make an expedition into the almost impenetrable regions which separated\r him from Lake Van.", "* The name of this chiefs father has always been read\r      Khâtukhi: it is a form of the name Khâtusaru borne by the\r      Hittite king in the time of Ramses II.", "** The site of Urrakhinas--read by Winckler Urartinas--is\r      very uncertain: the town was situated in a territory which\r      could belong equally well to the Kummukh or to the Kurkhi,\r      and the mention of the crossing of the Tigris seems to\r      indicate that it was on the right bank of the river,\r      probably in the mountain group of Tur-Abdîn.", "This district was, even more than at the present day, a confused\r labyrinth of wooded mountain ranges, through which the Eastern Tigris\r and its affluents poured their rapid waters in tortuous curves.", "As\r hitherto no army had succeeded in making its way through this territory\r with sufficient speed to surprise the fortified villages and scattered\r clans inhabiting the valleys and mountain slopes, Tiglath-pileser\r selected from his force a small troop of light infantry and thirty\r chariots, with which he struck into the forests; but, on reaching the\r Aruma, he was forced to abandon his chariotry and proceed with the\r foot-soldiers only.", "The Mildîsh, terrified by his sudden appearance,\r fell an easy prey to the invader; the king scattered the troops hastily\r collected to oppose him, set fire to a few fortresses, seized the\r peasantry and their flocks, and demanded hostages and the usual tribute\r as a condition of peace.*\r \r      * The Mildîsh of our inscription is to be identified with\r      the country of Mount Umildîsh, mentioned by Sargon of\r      Assyria.", "In his first campaign he thus reduced the upper and eastern half of\r Kummukh, namely, the part extending to the north of the Tigris, while in\r the following campaign he turned his attention to the regions bounded by\r the Euphrates and by the western spurs of the Kashiari.", "The Alzi and the\r Purukuzzi had been disconcerted by his victories, and had yielded him\r their allegiance almost without a struggle.", "To the southward, the Kashku\r and the Urumi, who had, to the number of four thousand, migrated from\r among the Khâti and compelled the towns of the Shubarti to break their\r alliance with the Ninevite kings, now made no attempt at resistance;\r they laid down their arms and yielded at discretion, giving up\r their goods and their hundred and twenty war-chariots, and resigning\r themselves to the task of colonising a distant corner of Assyria.", "Other\r provinces, however, were not so easily dealt with; the inhabitants\r entrenched themselves within their wild valleys, from whence they had\r to be ousted by sheer force; in the end they always had to yield, and to\r undertake to pay an annual tribute.", "The Assyrian empire thus regained\r on this side the countries which Shalmaneser I.", "had lost, owing to the\r absorption of his energies and interests in the events which were taking\r place in Chaldæa.", "In his third campaign Tiglath-pileser succeeded in bringing about the\r pacification of the border provinces which shut in the basin of the\r Tigris to the north and east.", "The Kurkhi did not consider themselves\r conquered by the check they had received at the Nâmi; several of their\r tribes were stirring in Kharia, on the highlands above the Arzania, and\r their restlessness threatened to infect such of their neighbours as\r had already submitted themselves to the Assyrian yoke.", "My master Assur\r commanded me to attack their proud summits, which no king has ever\r visited.", "I assembled my chariots and my foot-soldiers, and I\r passed between the Idni and the Ala, by a difficult country, across\r cloud-capped mountains whose peaks were as the point of a dagger,\r and unfavourable to the progress of my chariots; I therefore left my\r chariots in reserve, and I climbed these steep mountains.", "The community\r of the Kurkhi assembled its numerous troops, and in order to give me\r battle they entrenched themselves upon the Azubtagish; on the slopes of\r the mountain, an incommodious position, I came into conflict with\r them, and I vanquished them. This lesson cost them twenty-five towns,\r situated at the feet of the Aîa, the Shuîra, the Idni, the Shizu, the\r Silgu, and the Arzanabiu*--all twenty-five being burnt to the ground.", "* The site of Kharia must be sought for probably between the\r      sources of the Tigris and the Batman-tchaî.", "The dread of a similar fate impelled the neighbouring inhabitants of\r Adaush to beg for a truce, which was granted to them;* but the people of\r Saraush and of Ammaush, who from all time had never known what it was\r to obey, were cut to pieces, and their survivors incorporated into the\r empire--a like fate overtaking the Isua and the Daria, who inhabited\r Khoatras.**\r \r      * According to the context, the Adaush ought to be between\r      the Kharia and the Saraush; possibly between the Batman-\r      tchaî and the Bohtân-tchaî, in the neighbourhood of Mildîsh.", "** As Tiglath-pileser was forced to cross Mount Aruma in\r      order to reach the Ammaush and the Saraush, these two\r      countries, together with Isua and Daria, cannot be far from\r      Mildîsh; Isua is, indeed, mentioned as near to Anzitene in\r      an inscription of Shalmaneser II., which obliges us to place\r      it somewhere near the sources of the Batman-tchaî.", "The\r      position of Muraddash and Saradaush is indirectly pointed\r      out by the mention of the Lower Zab and the Lulumê; the name\r      of Saradaush is perhaps preserved in that of Surtash, borne\r      by the valley through which runs one of the tributaries of\r      the Lower Zab.", "Beyond this, again, on the banks of the Lesser Zab and the confines of\r Lulumô, the principalities of Muraddash and of Saradaush refused to come\r to terms.", "Tiglath-pileser broke their lines within sight of Muraddash,\r and entered the town with the fugitives in the confusion which ensued;\r this took place about the fourth hour of the day.", "The success was so\r prompt and complete, that the king was inclined to attribute it to the\r help of Rammân, and he made an offering to the temple of this god at\r Assur of all the copper, whether wrought or in ore, which was found\r among the spoil of the vanquished.", "He was recalled almost immediately\r after this victory by a sedition among the Kurkhi near the sources of\r the Tigris.", "One of their tribes, known as the Sugi, who had not as\r yet suffered from the invaders, had concentrated round their standards\r contingents from some half-dozen cities, and the united force was, to\r the number of six thousand, drawn up on Mount Khirikhâ.", "Tiglath-pileser\r was again victorious, and took from them twenty-five statues of their\r gods, which he despatched to Assyria to be distributed among the\r sanctuaries of Belît at Assur, of Anu, Bammân, and of Ishtar.", "Winter\r obliged him to suspend operations.", "When he again resumed them at the\r beginning of his third year, both the Kummukh and the Kurkhi were so\r peaceably settled that he was able to carry his expeditions without fear\r of danger further north, into the regions of the Upper Euphrates between\r the Halys and Lake Van, a district then known as Naîri.", "He marched\r diagonally across the plain of Diarbekîr, penetrated through dense\r forests, climbed sixteen mountain ridges one after the other by paths\r hitherto considered impracticable, and finally crossed the Euphrates by\r improvised bridges, this being, as far as we know, the first time that\r an Assyrian monarch had ventured into the very heart of those countries\r which had formerly constituted the Hittite empire.", "He found them occupied by rude and warlike tribes, who derived\r considerable wealth from working the mines, and possessed each their\r own special sanctuary, the ruins of which still appear above ground,\r and invite the attention of the explorer.", "Their fortresses must have all\r more or less resembled that city of the Pterians which flourished for so\r many ages just at the bend of the Halys;* its site is still marked by\r a mound rising to some thirty feet above the plain, resembling the\r platforms on which the Chaldæan temples were always built--a few walls\r of burnt brick, and within an enclosure, among the débris of rudely\r built houses, the ruins of some temples and palaces consisting of large\r irregular blocks of stone.", "* The remains of the palace of the city of the Pterians, the\r      present Euyuk, are probably later than the reign of Tiglath-\r      pileser, and may be attributed to the Xth or IXth century\r      before our era; they, however, probably give a very fair\r      idea of what the towns of the Cappadocian region were like\r      at the time of the first Assyrian invasions.", "[Illustration: 216.jpg GENERAL VIEW OF THE RUINS OF EUYUK]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph.", "[Illustration: 217.jpg THE SPHINX ON THE RIGHT OF EUYUK]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.", "Two colossal sphinxes guard the gateway of the principal edifice,\r and their presence proves with certainty how predominant was Egyptian\r influence even at this considerable distance from the banks of the Nile.", "They are not the ordinary sphinxes, with a human head surmounting the\r body of a lion couchant on its stone pedestal; but, like the Assyrian\r bulls, they are standing, and, to judge from the Hathorian locks which\r fall on each side of their countenances, they must have been intended\r to represent a protecting goddess rather than a male deity.", "A remarkable\r emblem is carved on the side of the upright to which their bodies are\r attached; it is none other than the double-headed eagle, the prototype\r of which is not infrequently found at Telloh in Lower Chaldæa, among\r remains dating from the time of the kings and vicegerents of Lagash.", "[Illustration: 218.jpg TWO BLOCKS COVERED WITH BAS-RELIEFS IN THE EUYUK\r PALACE]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.", "The court or hall to which this gate gave access was decorated with\r bas-reliefs, which exhibit a glaring imitation of Babylonian art; we can\r still see on these the king, vested in his long flowing robes, praying\r before an altar, while further on is a procession of dignitaries\r following a troop of rams led by a priest to be sacrificed; another\r scene represents two individuals in the attitude of worship, wearing\r short loin-cloths, and climbing a ladder whose upper end has an\r uncertain termination, while a third person applies his hands to his\r mouth in the performance of some mysterious ceremony; beyond these are\r priests and priestesses moving in solemn file as if in the measured\r tread of some sacred dance, while in one corner we find the figure of a\r woman, probably a goddess, seated, holding in one hand a flower, perhaps\r the full-blown lotus, and in the other a cup from which she is about to\r drink.", "The costume of all these figures is that which Chaldæan fashion\r had imposed upon the whole of Western Asia, and consisted of the long\r heavy robe, falling from the shoulders to the feet, drawn in at the\r waist by a girdle; but it is to be noted that both sexes are shod with\r the turned-up shoes of the Hittites, and that the women wear high peaked\r caps.", "[Illustration: 219.jpg MYSTIC SCENE AT EUYUK]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.", "The composition of the scenes is rude, the drawing incorrect, and the\r general technique reminds us rather of the low reliefs of the Memphite\r or Theban sculptors than of the high projection characteristic of the\r artists of the Lower Euphrates.", "These slabs of sculptured stone formed\r a facing at the base of the now crumbling brick walls, the upper\r surface of which was covered with rough plastering.", "Here and there a\r few inscriptions reveal the name, titles, and parentage of some once\r celebrated personage, and mention the god in whose honour he had\r achieved the work.", "[Illustration: 220.jpg AN ASIATIC GODDESS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.", "The characters in which these inscriptions are written are not, as a\r rule, incised in the stone, but are cut in relief upon its surface,\r and if some few of them may remind us of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, the\r majority are totally unlike them, both in form and execution.", "A careful\r examination of them reveals a medley of human and animal outlines,\r geometrical figures, and objects of daily use, which all doubtless\r corresponded to some letter or syllable, but to which we have as yet\r no trustworthy key.", "This system of writing is one of a whole group of\r Asiatic scripts, specimens of which are common in this part of the world\r from Crete to the banks of the Euphrates and Orontes.", "It is thought that\r the Khâti must have already adopted it before their advent to power, and\r that it was they who propagated it in Northern Syria.", "It did not take\r the place of the cuneiform syllabary for ordinary purposes of daily life\r owing to its clumsiness and complex character, but its use was reserved\r for monumental inscriptions of a royal or religious kind, where it could\r be suitably employed as a framework to scenes or single figures.", "[Illustration: 221.jpg THE ASIATIC INSCRIPTION OF KOLITOLU-YAÎLA]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Hogarth.", "It, however, never presented the same graceful appearance and\r arrangement as was exhibited in the Egyptian hieroglyphs, the signs\r placed side by side being out of proportion with each other so as to\r destroy the general harmony of the lines, and it must be regarded as a\r script still in process of formation and not yet emerged from infancy.", "Every square yard of soil turned up among the ruins of the houses of\r Euyuk yields vestiges of tools, coarse pottery, terra-cotta and bronze\r statuettes of men and animals, and other objects of a not very high\r civilization.", "The few articles of luxury discovered, whether in\r furniture or utensils, were not indigenous products, but were imported\r for the most part from Chaldæa, Syria, Phoenicia, and perhaps from\r Egypt; some objects, indeed, came from the coast-towns of the Ægean,\r thus showing that Western influence was already in contact with the\r traditions of the East.", "[Illustration: 222.jpg DOUBLE SCEND OF OFFERINGS]\r \r      Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Hogarth.", "It\r      will be remarked that both altars are in the form of a\r      female without a head, but draped in the Assyrian robe.", "All the various races settled between the Halys and the Orontes were\r more or less imbued with this foreign civilization, and their monuments,\r though not nearly so numerous as those of the Pharaohs and Ninevite\r kings, bear, nevertheless, an equally striking evidence of its power.", "Examples of it have been pointed out in a score of different places in\r the valleys of the Taurus and on the plains of Cappadocia, in\r bas-reliefs, steke, seals, and intaglios, several of which must be\r nearly contemporaneous with the first Assyrian conquest.", "[Illustration: 223.jpg THE BAS-RELIEF OF IBRIZ]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Hogarth.", "One instance of it appears on the rocks at Ibriz, where a king stands in\r a devout attitude before a jovial giant whose hands are full of grapes\r and wheat-ears, while in another bas-relief near Frakhtîn we have a\r double scene of sacrifice.", "The rock-carving at Ibriz is, perhaps, of all\r the relics of a forgotten world, that which impresses the spectator most\r favourably.", "The concept of the scene is peculiarly naïve; indeed, the\r two figures are clumsily brought together, though each of them, when\r examined separately, is remarkable for its style and execution.", "The king\r has a dignified bearing in spite of his large head, round eyes, and the\r unskilful way in which his arms are set on his body.", "The figure of the\r god is not standing firmly on both feet, but the sculptor has managed\r to invest him with an air of grandeur and an expression of vigour and\r _bonhomie,_ which reminds us of certain types of the Greek Hercules.", "Tiglath-pileser was probably attracted to Asia Minor as much by\r considerations of mercantile interest as by the love of conquest or\r desire for spoil.", "It would, indeed, have been an incomparable gain for\r him had he been able, if not to seize the mines themselves, at least\r to come into such close proximity to them that he would be able to\r monopolise their entire output, and at the same time to lay hands on the\r great commercial highway to the trade centres of the west.", "The eastern\r terminus of this route lay already within his domains, namely, that\r which led to Assur by way of Amid, Nisibe, Singar, and the valley of the\r Upper Tigris; he was now desirous of acquiring that portion of it\r which wound its way from the fords of the Euphrates at Malatîyeh to the\r crossing of the Halys.", "The changes which had just taken place in\r Kummukh and Nairi had fully aroused the numerous petty sovereigns of\r the neighbourhood.", "The bonds which kept them together had not been\r completely severed at the downfall of the Hittite empire, and a certain\r sense of unity still lingered among them in spite of their continual\r feuds; they constituted, in fact, a sort of loose confederation, whose\r members never failed to help one another when they were threatened by a\r common enemy.", "As soon as the news of an Assyrian invasion reached them,\r they at once put aside their-mutual quarrels and combined to oppose\r the invader with their united forces.", "Tiglath-pileser had, therefore,\r scarcely crossed the Euphrates before he was attacked on his right flank\r by twenty-three petty kings of Naîri,* while sixty other chiefs from the\r same neighbourhood bore down upon him in front.", "He overcame the first\r detachment of the confederates, though not without a sharp struggle; he\r carried carnage into their ranks, as it were the whirlwind of Eammân,\r  and seized a hundred and twenty of the enemys chariots.", "The sixty\r chiefs, whose domains extended as far as the Upper Sea, ** were\r disconcerted by the news of the disaster, and of their own accord laid\r down their arms, or offered but a feeble resistance.", "* The text of the Annals of the Xth year give thirty instead\r      of twenty-three; in the course of five or six years the\r      numbers have already become exaggerated.", "** The site of the Upper Sea has furnished material for\r      much discussion.", "Some believe it to be the Caspian Sea or\r      the Black Sea, others take it to be Lake Van, while some\r      think it to be the Mediterranean, and more particularly the\r      Gulf of Issus between Syria and Cilicia.", "At the present day\r      several scholars have returned to the theory which makes it\r      the Black Sea.", "Tiglath-pileser presented some of them in chains to the god Shamash; he\r extorted an oath of vassalage from them, forced them to give up their\r children as hostages, and laid a tax upon them _en masse_ of 1200\r stallions and 2000 bulls, after which he permitted them to return to\r their respective towns.", "He had, however, singled out from among them to\r grace his own triumph, Sini of Dayana, the only chief among them who had\r offered him an obstinate resistance; but even he was granted his liberty\r after he had been carried captive to Assur, and made to kneel before the\r gods of Assyria.*\r \r      * Dayani, which is mentioned in the Annals of Shalmaneser\r      II., has been placed on the banks of the Murad-su by\r      Schrader, and more particularly in the neighbourhood of\r      Melasgerd by Sayce; Delattre has shown that it was the last\r      and most westerly of twenty-three kingdoms conquered by\r      Tiglath-pileser I., and that it was consequently enclosed\r      between the Murad-su and the Euphrates proper.", "Before returning to the capital, Tiglath-pileser attacked Khanigalbat,\r and appeared before Milidia: as the town attempted no defence, he spared\r it, and contented himself with levying a small contribution upon\r its inhabitants.", "This expedition was rather of the nature of a\r reconnaissance than a conquest, but it helped to convince the king\r of the difficulty of establishing any permanent suzerainty over the\r country.", "The Asiatic peoples were quick to bow before a sudden attack;\r but no sooner had the conqueror departed, than those who had sworn him\r eternal fealty sought only how best to break their oaths.", "The tribes in\r immediate proximity to those provinces which had been long subject to\r the Assyrian rule, were intimidated into showing some respect for a\r power which existed so close to their own borders.", "But those further\r removed from the seat of government felt a certain security in\r their distance from it, and were tempted to revert to the state of\r independence they had enjoyed before the conquest; so that unless the\r sovereign, by a fresh campaign, promptly made them realise that their\r disaffection would not remain unpunished, they soon forgot their\r feudatory condition and the duties which it entailed.", "Three years of merciless conflict with obstinate and warlike mountain\r tribes had severely tried the Assyrian army, if it had not worn out\r the sovereign; the survivors of so many battles were in sore need of a\r well-merited repose, the gaps left by death had to be filled, and both\r infantry and chariotry needed the re-modelling of their corps.", "The\r fourth year of the kings reign, therefore, was employed almost entirely\r in this work of reorganisation; we find only the record of a raid of\r a few weeks against the Akhlamî and other nomadic Aramæans situated\r beyond the Mesopotamian steppes.", "The Assyrians spread over the district\r between the frontiers of Sukhi and the fords of Carchemish for a whole\r day, killing all who resisted, sacking the villages and laying hands\r on slaves and cattle.", "The fugitives escaped over the Euphrates, vainly\r hoping that they would be secure in the very heart of the Khâti.", "Tiglath-pileser, however, crossed the river on rafts supported on skins,\r and gave the provinces of Mount Bishri over to fire and sword:* six\r walled towns opened their gates to him without having ventured to strike\r a blow, and he quitted the country laden with spoil before the kings of\r the surrounding cities had had time to recover from their alarm.", "* The country of Bishri was situated, as the _Annals_ point\r      out, in the immediate neighbourhood of Carchemish.", "The name\r      is preserved in that of Tell Basher still borne by the\r      ruins, and a modern village on the banks of the Sajur.", "The\r      Gebel Bishri to which Hommel alludes is too far to the south\r      to correspond to the description given in the inscription of\r      Tiglath-pileser.", "This expedition was for Tiglath-pileser merely an interlude between\r two more serious campaigns; and with the beginning of his fifth year\r he reappeared in the provinces of the Upper Euphrates to complete his\r conquest of them.", "He began by attacking and devastating Musri, which lay\r close to the territory of Milid.", "While thus occupied he was harassed by\r bands of Kumani; he turned upon them, overcame them, and imprisoned the\r remainder of them in the fortress of Arini, at the foot of Mount Aisa,\r where he forced them to kiss his feet.", "His victory over them, however,\r did not disconcert their neighbours.", "The bulk of the Kumani, whose\r troops had scarcely suffered in the engagement, fortified themselves\r on Mount Tala, to the number of twenty thousand; the king carried the\r heights by assault, and hotly pursued the fugitives as far as the range\r of Kharusa before Musri, where the fortress of Khunusa afforded them\r a retreat behind its triple walls of brick.", "The king, nothing daunted,\r broke his way through them one after another, demolished the ramparts,\r razed the houses, and strewed the ruins with salt; he then constructed\r a chapel of brick as a sort of trophy, and dedicated within it what\r was known as a copper thunderbolt, being an image of the missile which\r Eammân, the god of thunder, brandished in the face of his enemies.", "An\r inscription engraved on the object recorded the destruction of Khunusa,\r and threatened with every divine malediction the individual, whether\r an Assyrian or a stranger, who should dare to rebuild the city.", "This\r victory terrified the Kumani, and their capital, Kibshuna, opened\r its gates to the royal troops at the first summons.", "Tiglath-pileser\r completely destroyed the town, but granted the inhabitants their lives\r on condition of their paying tribute; he chose from among them, however,\r three hundred families who had shown him the most inveterate hostility,\r and sent them as exiles into Assyria.*\r \r      * The country of the Kumani or Kammanu is really the\r      district of Comana in Cataonia, and not the Comana Pontica\r      or the Khammanene on the banks of the Halys.", "Delattre thinks\r      that Tiglath-pileser penetrated into this region by the\r      Jihun, and consequently seeks to identify the names of towns\r      and mountains, e.g.", "Mount Ilamuni with Jaur-dagh, the\r      Kharusa with Shorsh-dagh, and the Tala with the Kermes-dagh;\r      but it is difficult to believe that, if the king took this\r      route, he would not mention the town of Marqasi-Marash,\r      which lay at the very foot of the Jaur-dagh, and would have\r      stopped his passage.", "It is more probable that the Assyrians,\r      starting from Melitene, which they had just subdued, would\r      have followed the route which skirts the northern slope of\r      the Taurus by Albistan; the scene of the conflict in this\r      case would probably have been the mountainous district of\r      Zeitûn.", "With this victory the first half of his reign drew to its close; in five\r years Tiglath-pileser had subjugated forty-two peoples and their princes\r within an area extending from the banks of the Lower Zab to the plains\r of the Khâti, and as far as the shores of the Western Seas.", "He revisited\r more than once these western and northern regions in which he had\r gained his early triumphs.", "The reconnaissance which he had made\r around Carchemish had revealed to him the great wealth of the Syrian\r table-land, and that a second raid in that direction could be made more\r profitable than ten successful campaigns in Naîri or upon the banks\r of the Zab.", "He therefore marched his battalions thither, this time\r to remain for more than a few days.", "He made his way through the whole\r breadth of the country, pushed forward up the valley of the Orontes,\r crossed the Lebanon, and emerged above the coast of the Mediterranean in\r the vicinity of Arvad.", "[Illustration: 230.jpg SACRIFICE OFFERED BEFORE THE ROYAL STELE]\r \r      Drawn by

thought, as far as the Nahr el-Kelb, and the sight of the hieroglyphic\r inscriptions which Ramses had caused to be cut there three centuries\r previously aroused his emulation.", "Assyrian conquerors rarely quitted\r the scene of their exploits without leaving behind them some permanent\r memorial of their presence.", "A sculptor having hastily smoothed the\r surface of a rock, cut out on it a

TABLE OF KINGS]\r \r What were the causes of this depression, from which Babylon suffered at\r almost regular intervals, as though stricken with some periodic malady?", "The main reason soon becomes

ambition of her princes.", "Since nearly every man capable\r of bearing arms was enrolled in the army, the Chaktean kings had no\r difficulty in raising, at a moments notice, a force which could be\r employed to repel an invasion, or make a sudden attack on some distant\r territory; it was in schemes which required prolonged and sustained\r effort that they felt the drawbacks of their position.", "In that age of\r hand-to-hand combats, the mortality in battle was very high, forced\r marches through forests and across mountains entailed a heavy loss of\r men, and three or four consecutive campaigns against a stubborn foe soon\r reduced an army to a condition of dangerous weakness.", "Recruits might be\r obtained to fill the earlier vacancies in the ranks, but they soon grew\r fewer and fewer if time was not given for recovery after the opening\r victories in the struggle, and the supply eventually ceased if\r operations were carried on beyond a certain period.", "The total duration of the dynasty was, according to the Royal Canon, 72\r years 6 months.", "Peiser has shown that this is a mistake, and he proposes\r to correct it to 132 years 6 months, and this is accepted by most\r Assyri-ologists.", "A reign which began brilliantly often came to an impotent conclusion,\r owing to the king having failed to economise his reserves; and the\r generations which followed, compelled to adopt a strictly defensive\r attitude, vegetated in a sort of anaemic condition, until the birth-rate\r had brought the proportion of males up to a figure sufficiently high to\r provide the material for a fresh army.", "When Nebuchadrezzar made war upon\r Assurîshishî, he was still weak from the losses he had incurred during\r the campaign against Elam, and could not conduct his attack with the\r same vigour as had gained him victory on the banks of the Ulaî; in\r the first year he only secured a few indecisive advantages, and in the\r second he succumbed.", "Merodach-nadin-akhi was suffering from the reverses\r sustained by his predecessors when Tiglath-pileser provoked him to war,\r and though he succeeded in giving a good account of an adversary who was\r himself exhausted by dearly bought successes, he left to his descendants\r a kingdom which had been drained of its last drop of blood.", "The same\r reason which explains the decadence of Babylon shows us the cause of\r the periodic eclipses undergone by Assyria after each outburst of her\r warlike spirit.", "She, too, had to pay the penalty of an ambition\r which was out of all proportion to her resources.", "The mighty deeds of\r Shalmaneser and Tukulti-ninip were, as a natural consequence,\r followed by a state of complete prostration under Tukultiassurbel\r and Assurnîrarî: the country was now forced to pay for the glories of\r Assurîshishî and of Tiglath-pileser by falling into an inglorious state\r of languor and depression.", "Its kings, conscious that their rule must be\r necessarily precarious as long as they did not possess a larger stock of\r recruits to fall back on, set their wits to work to provide by various\r methods a more adequate reserve.", "While on one hand they installed native\r Assyrians in the more suitable towns of conquered countries, on the\r other they imported whole hordes of alien prisoners chosen for their\r strength and courage, and settled them down in districts by the banks of\r the Tigris and the Zab.", "We do not know what Eammânirâni and Shalmaneser\r may have done in this way, but Tiglath-pileser undoubtedly introduced\r thousands of the Mushku, the Urumseans, the people of Kummukh and\r Naîri, and his example was followed by all those of his successors\r whose history has come down to us.", "One might have expected that such an\r invasion of foreigners, still smarting under the sense of defeat, might\r have brought with it an element of discontent or rebellion; far from\r it, they accepted their exile as a judgment of the gods, which the\r gods alone had a right to reverse, and did their best to mitigate the\r hardness of their lot by rendering unhesitating obedience to their\r masters.", "Their grandchildren, born in the midst of Assyrians, became\r Assyrians themselves, and if they did not entirely divest themselves of\r every trace of their origin, at any rate became so closely identified\r with the country of their adoption, that it was difficult to distinguish\r them from the native race.", "The Assyrians who were sent out to colonise\r recently acquired provinces were at times exposed to serious risks.", "Now\r and then, instead of absorbing the natives among whom they lived, they\r were absorbed by them, which meant a loss of so much fighting strength\r to the mother country; even under the most favourable conditions\r a considerable time must have passed before they could succeed in\r assimilating to themselves the races amongst whom they lived.", "At\r last, however, a day would dawn when the process of incorporation was\r accomplished, and Assyria, having increased her area and resources\r twofold, found herself ready to endure to the end the strain of\r conquest.", "In the interval, she suffered from a scarcity of fighting men,\r due to the losses incurred in her victories, and must have congratulated\r herself that her traditional foe was not in a position to take advantage\r of this fact.", "The first wave of the Assyrian invasion had barely touched Syria; it\r had swept hurriedly over the regions in the north, and then flowed\r southwards to return no more, so that the northern races were able to\r resume the wonted tenor of their lives.", "For centuries after this\r their condition underwent no change; there was the same repetition of\r dissension and intrigue, the same endless succession of alliances and\r battles without any signal advantage on either side.", "The Hittites still\r held Northern Syria: Carchemish was their capital, and more than one\r town in its vicinity preserved the tradition of their dress, their\r language, their arts, and their culture in full vigour.", "The Greek\r legends tell us vaguely of some sort of Cilician empire which is said\r to have brought the eastern and central provinces of Asia Minor into\r subjection about ten centuries before our era.*\r \r      * Solinus, relying on the indirect evidence of Hecatseus of\r      Miletus, tells us that Cilicia extended not only to the\r      countries afterwards known as Cataonia, Commagene, and\r      Syria, but also included Lydia, Media, Armenia, Pamphylia,\r      and Cappadocia; the conquests of the Assyrian kings must\r      have greatly reduced its area.", "I am of opinion that the\r      tradition preserved by  Hecatous referred both to the\r      kingdom of Sapalulu and to that of the monarchs of this\r      second epoch.", "Is there any serious foundation for such a belief, and must we assume\r that there existed at this time and in this part of the world a kingdom\r similar to that of Sapalulu?", "Assyria was recruiting its forces, Chaldæa\r was kept inactive by its helplessness, Egypt slumbered by the banks of\r its river, there was no actor of the first rank to fill the stage; now\r was the opportunity for a second-rate performer to come on the scene and\r play such a part as his abilities permitted.", "The Cilician conquest, if\r this be indeed the date at which it took place, had the boards to itself\r for a hundred years after the defeat of Assurirba.", "The time was too\r short to admit of its striking deep root in the country.", "Its leaders and\r men were, moreover, closely related to the Syrian Hittites; the language\r they spoke was, if not precisely the Hittite, at any rate a dialect of\r it; their customs were similar, if, perhaps, somewhat less refined, as\r is often the case with mountain races, when compared with the peoples of\r the plain.", "We are tempted to conclude that some of the monuments found\r south of

considerable nation.", "Its component\r elements were not, however, firmly welded together; they consisted of\r an indefinite number of clans, which were again subdivided into several\r families.", "Each of these families had its chief or ruler, to whom it\r rendered absolute obedience, while the united chiefs formed an assembly\r of elders who administered justice when required, and settled

have been fostered by daily\r intercourse on a common soil, but the ties which bound them together at\r this period were of the most slender character.", "It needed some special\r event, such as a projected migration in search of fresh pasturage, or\r an expedition against a turbulent neighbour, or a threatened invasion\r by some stranger, to rouse the whole tribe to corporate action; at\r such times they would elect a nasi, or ruler, the duration of whose\r functions ceased with the emergency which had called him into office.**\r \r      * The tribe was designated by two words signifying

captivity, the title of the chiefs of\r      Israel, who could not be called _kings_ owing to the foreign\r      suzerainty (_Esdras_ i.", "8).", "Both clans and tribes were designated by the name of some ancestor from\r whom they claimed to be descended, and who appears in some cases to\r have been a god for whom they had a special devotion; some writers have\r believed that this was also the origin of the names given to several of\r the tribes, such as Gad, Good Fortune, or of the totems of the hyena\r and the dog, in Arabic and Hebrew, Simeon and Caleb. * Gad, Simeon,\r and Caleb were severally the ancestors of the families who ranged\r themselves under their respective names, and the eponymous heroes of\r all the tribes were held to have been brethren, sons of one father,

in the storm;** His voice\r was as the thunder which shaketh the wilderness, His breath was as a\r consuming fire, and He was decked with light as with a garment. When\r His anger was aroused, He withheld the dew and rain from watering the\r earth; but when His wrath was appeased, the heavens again poured their\r fruitful showers upon the fields.***\r \r      * Simeon is derived by some from a word which at times\r      denotes a hyena, at others a cross between a dog and a\r      hyena, according to Arab lexicography.", "With regard to Caleb,\r      Renan prefers a different interpretation; it is supposed to\r      be a shortened form of Kalbel, and Dog of El is a strong\r      expression to denote the devotion of a tribe to its patron\r      god.", "** Cf.", "the

visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third\r and fourth generation. We hear of His having been adored under the\r figure of a calf, * and of His Spirit inspiring His prophets, as well\r as of the anointed stones which were dedicated in His honour.", "The common\r ancestor of the nation was acknowledged to have been Jacob, who, by his\r wrestling with God, had obtained the name of Israel; the people were\r divided theoretically into as many tribes as he had sons, but the number\r twelve to which they were limited does not entirely correspond with all\r that we know up to the present time of these children of Israel. Some\r of the tribes appear never to have had any political existence, as for\r example that of Levi,** or they were merged at an early date into some\r fellow-tribe, as in the case of Reuben with Gad;*** others, such as\r Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, and Judah, apparently did not attain their\r normal development until a much later

Reubenites, and speaks of the Gadites only as inhabiting the\r      territory formerly occupied by them.", "Tradition attributed\r      the misfortunes of the tribe to the crime of its chief in\r      his seduction of Bilhah, his fathers concubine (Gen.", "xlix.", "3, 4; cf.", "xxxv.", "22)\r \r The Jewish chroniclers attempted by various combinations to prove that\r the sacred number of tribes

substituted his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh.** In addition to this,\r the tribes were very unequal in size: Ephraim, Gad, and Manasseh\r comprised many powerful and wealthy families; Dan, on the

right of priority over the rest.*\r \r      * This conclusion is drawn from the position of eldest son\r      given to him in all the genealogies enumerating the children\r      of Jacob.", "Stade, on the contrary, is inclined to believe\r      that this place of honour was granted to him on account of\r      the smallness of his family, to prevent any jealousy arising\r      between the more powerful tribes, such as Ephraim and Judah\r      (_Ges.", "des Vollces Isr._, vol.", "i.", "pp.", "151, 152).", "The territory which they occupied soon became insufficient to support\r their numbers, and they sought to exchange it for a wider area, such as\r was offered by the neighbouring provinces of Southern Syria.", "Pharaoh\r at this time exercised no authority over this region, and they were,\r therefore, no longer in fear of opposition from his troops; the latter\r had been recalled to Egypt, and it is doubtful even whether he retained\r possession of the Shephelah by means of his

of the Aramæans,\r had abandoned the positions they had formerly occupied on the banks\r of the Orontes and the Litany, and had moved southwards, driving the\r Canaanites before them; their advance was accelerated as the resistance\r opposed to their hordes became lessened under the successors of Ramses\r III., until at length all opposition was withdrawn.", "They had possessed\r themselves of the regions about the Lake of Genesareth, the mountain\r district to the south of Tabor, the middle valley of the Jordan, and,\r pressing towards the territory east of that river, had attacked the\r

necklaces, bracelets,\r rings, and ear-rings, and their camels also were not behind their\r masters in the brilliance of their caparison.", "The booty which Gideon\r secured was, therefore,

greater abundance of the necessaries of life than they had been\r accustomed to, had begotten aspirations which threw into relief the\r inadequacy of the social organisation, and of the form of government\r with which they had previously been content.", "In the case of a horde\r of nomads, defeat or exile would be of little moment.", "Should they be\r obliged by a turn in their affairs to

requirements.", "His agents went down at regular intervals to the\r banks of the Nile to lay in stock; the horses and chariots, by the\r time they reached Jerusalem, cost him at the rate of six hundred silver\r shekels for each chariot, and one hundred and fifty shekels for each\r horse, but he sold them again at a profit to the Aramæan and Hittite\r princes.", "In return he purchased from them Cilician stallions, probably\r to sell again to the Egyptians, whose relaxing climate necessitated a\r frequent introduction of new blood into their stables.** By these and\r other methods of which we know nothing the yearly revenue of the kingdom\r was largely increased: and though it only reached a total which may seem\r insignificant in comparison with the enormous quantities of the

geographical positions, into\r two masses of unequal numbers and extent--Judah in the south, together\r with the few clans who remained loyal to the kingly house, and Israel in\r the north and the regions beyond Jordan, occupying three-fourths of the\r territory which had belonged to David and Solomon.", "Israel, in spite of its extent and population, did not enjoy the\r predominant position which we might have expected at the beginning of\r its independent existence.", "It had no political unity, no capital\r in which to concentrate its resources, no temple, and no army; it\r represented the material out of which a state could be formed rather\r than one already constituted.", "It was subdivided into three groups,\r formerly independent of, and almost strangers to each other, and between\r whom neither David nor Solomon had been able to establish any bond which\r would enable them to forget their former isolation.", "The centre group was\r composed of the House of Joseph--Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh--and\r comprised the old fortresses of Perea, Mahanaim, Penuel, Succoth,\r and Eamoth, ranged in a line running parallel with the Jordan.", "In the\r eastern group were the semi-nomad tribes of Reuben and Gad, who still\r persisted in the pastoral habits of their ancestors, and remained\r indifferent to the various revolutions which had agitated their race\r for several generations.", "Finally, in the northern group lay the smaller\r tribes of Asher, Naphtali, Issachar, Zebulon, and Dan, hemmed in between\r the Phoenicians and the Aramaeans of Zoba and Damascus.", "Each group had\r its own traditions, its own interests often opposed to those of its\r neighbours, and its own peculiar mode of life, which it had no intention\r of renouncing for any one elses benefit.", "The difficulty of keeping\r these groups together became at once apparent.", "Shechem had been the\r first to revolt against Rehoboam; it was a large and populous town,\r situated almost in the centre of the newly formed state, and the seat of\r an ancient oracle, both of which advantages seemed to single it out as\r the future capital.", "But its very importance, and the memories of its\r former greatness under Jeruhhaal and Abimelech, were against it.", "Built\r in the western territory belonging to Manasseh, the eastern and northern\r clans would at once object to its being chosen, on the ground that it\r would humiliate them before the House of Joseph, in the same manner as\r the selection of Jerusalem had tended to make them subservient to Judah.", "Jeroboam would have endangered his cause by fixing on it as his capital,\r and he therefore soon quitted it to establish himself at Tirzah.", "It is\r true that the latter town was also situated in the mountains of Ephraim,\r but it was so obscure and insignificant a place that it disarmed all\r jealousy; the new king therefore took up his residence in it, since he\r was forced to fix on some royal abode, but it never became for him what\r Jerusalem was to his rival, a capital at once religious and military.", "He\r had his own sanctuary and priests at Tirzah, as was but natural, but\r had he attempted to found a temple which would have attracted the whole\r population to a common worship, he would have excited jealousies which\r would have been fatal to his authority.", "On the other hand, Solomons\r temple had in its short period of existence not yet acquired such a\r prestige as to prevent Jeroboams drawing his people away from it:\r which he determined to do from a fear that contact with Jerusalem would\r endanger the allegiance of his subjects to his person and family.", "Such\r concourses of worshippers, assembling at periodic intervals from all\r parts of the country, soon degenerated into a kind of fair, in which\r commercial as well as religious motives had their part.", "[Illustration: 391.jpg THE MOUND AND PLAIN OF BETHEL.]\r \r      Drawn by Boudier, from the photograph published by the Duc\r      de Luynes.", "These gatherings formed a source of revenue to the prince in\r whose capital they were held, and financial as well as political\r considerations required that periodical assemblies should be established\r in Israel similar to those which attracted Judah to Jerusalem.", "Jeroboam\r adopted a plan which while safeguarding the interests of his treasury,\r prevented his becoming unpopular with his own subjects; as he was\r unable to have a temple for himself alone, he chose two out of the most\r venerated ancient sanctuaries, that of Dan for the northern tribes, and\r that of Bethel, on the Judæan frontier, for the tribes of the east and\r centre.", "He made two calves of gold, one for each place, and said to the\r people, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold thy gods,\r O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. He granted\r the sanctuaries certain appanages, and established a priesthood\r answering to that which officiated in the rival kingdom: whosoever\r would he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high\r places. * While Jeroboam thus endeavoured to strengthen himself on the\r throne by adapting the monarchy to the temperament of the tribes over\r which he ruled, Rehoboam took measures to regain his lost ground and\r restore the unity which he himself had destroyed.", "He recruited the army\r which had been somewhat neglected in the latter years of his father,\r restored the walls of the cities which had remained faithful to him, and\r fortified the places which constituted his frontier defences against the\r Israelites.** His ambition was not as foolish as we might be tempted to\r imagine.", "He had soldiers, charioteers, generals, skilled in the art of\r war, well-filled storehouses, the remnant of the wealth of Solomon, and,\r as a last resource, the gold of the temple at Jerusalem.", "He ruled over\r the same extent of territory as that possessed by David after the death\r of Saul, but the means at his disposal were incontestably greater than\r those of his grandfather, and it is possible that he might in the\r end have overcome Jeroboam, as David overcame Ishbosheth, had not the\r intervention of Egypt disconcerted his plans, and, by exhausting his\r material forces, struck a death-blow to all his hopes.", "* 1 Kings xii.", "25-32; chaps, xii.", "33, xiii., xiv.", "1-18\r      contain, side by side with the narrative of facts, such as\r      the death of Jeroboams son, comments on the religious\r      conduct of the sovereign, which some regard as being of\r      later date.", "** 1 Kings xii.", "21-24; cf.", "2 Ghron.", "xi.", "1-17, where the list\r      of strongholds, wanting in the Boole of Kings, is given from\r      an ancient source.", "The writer affirms, in harmony with the\r      ideas of his time, that the Lévites left their suburbs and\r      their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for\r      Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not\r      execute the Priests office unto the Lord.\r \r The century and a half which had elapsed since the death of the last of\r the Ramessides had, as far as we can ascertain, been troubled by civil\r wars and revolutions.*\r \r * I have mentioned above the uncertainty which still shrouds the XXth\r dynasty.", "The following is the order in which I propose that its kings\r should be placed:--\r \r [Illustration: 393.jpg TABLE OF KINGS]\r \r The imperious Egypt of the Theban dynasties had passed away, but a new\r Egypt had arisen, not without storm and struggle, in its place.", "As long\r as the campaigns of the Pharaohs had been confined to the Nile valley\r and the Oases, Thebes had been the natural centre of the kingdom; placed\r almost exactly between the Mediterranean and the southern frontier, it\r had been both the national arsenal and the treasure-house to which all\r foreign wealth had found its way from the Persian Gulf to the Sahara,\r and from the coasts of Asia Minor to the equatorial swamps.", "The cities\r of the Delta, lying on the frontier of those peoples with whom Egypt\r now held but little intercourse, possessed neither the authority nor the\r resources of Thebes; even Memphis, to which the prestige of her ancient\r dynasties still clung, occupied but a secondary place beside her rival.", "The invasion of the shepherds, by making the Thebaid the refuge and\r last bulwark of the Egyptian nation, increased its importance: in the\r critical times of the struggle, Thebes was not merely the foremost city\r in the country, it represented the country itself, and the heart of\r Egypt may be said to have throbbed within its walls.", "The victories of\r Ahmosis, the expeditions of Thûtmosis I.", "and Thûtmosis III., enlarged\r her horizon; her Pharaohs crossed the isthmus of Suez, they conquered\r Syria, subdued the valleys of the Euphrates and the Balîkh, and by so\r doing increased her wealth and her splendour.", "Her streets witnessed\r during two centuries processions of barbarian prisoners laden with the\r spoils of conquest.", "But with the advent of the XIXth and XXth dynasties\r came anxious times; the peoples of Syria and Libya, long kept in\r servitude, at length rebelled, and the long distance between Karnak and\r Gaza soon began to be irksome to princes who had to be constantly on\r the alert on the Canaanite frontier, and who found it impossible to have\r their head-quarters six hundred miles from the scene of hostilities.", "Hence it came about that Ramses II., Mînephtah, and Ramses III.", "all\r took up their abode in the Delta during the greater part of their active\r life; they restored its ancient towns and founded new ones, which\r soon acquired considerable wealth by foreign commerce.", "The centre\r of government of the empire, which, after the dissolution of the old\r Memphite state, had been removed southwards to Thebes on account of the\r conquest of Ethiopia and the encroachment of Theban civilization upon\r Nubia and the Sudan, now gradually returned northwards, and passing over\r Heracleo-polis, which had exercised a transitory supremacy, at length\r established itself in the Delta.", "Tanis, Bubastis, Sais, Mondes, and\r Sebennytos all disputed the honour of forming the royal residence, and\r all in turn during the course of ages enjoyed the privilege without ever\r rising to the rank of Thebes, or producing any sovereigns to be compared\r with those of her triumphant dynasties.", "Tanis was, as we have seen, the\r first of these to rule the whole of the Nile valley.", "Its prosperity had\r continued to increase from the time that Ramses II.", "began to rebuild it;\r the remaining inhabitants of Avaris, mingled with the natives of pure\r race and the prisoners of war settled there, had furnished it with an\r active and industrious population, which had considerably increased\r during the peaceful reigns of the XXth dynasty.", "The surrounding country,\r drained and cultivated by unremitting efforts, became one of the most\r fruitful parts of the Delta; there was a large exportation of fish\r and corn, to which were soon added the various products of its\r manufactories, such as linen and woollen stuffs, ornaments, and objects\r in glass and in precious metals.*\r \r      * The immense number of designs taken from aquatic plants,\r      as, for instance, the papyrus and the lotus, single or in\r      groups, as well as from fish and aquatic birds, which we\r      observe on objects of Phoenician goldsmiths work, leads me\r      to believe that the Tyrian and Sidonian artists borrowed\r      most of their models from the Delta, and doubtless from\r      Tanis, the most flourishing town of the Delta during the\r      centuries following the downfall of Thebes.", "These were embarked on Egyptian or Phoenician galleys, and were\r exchanged in the ports of the Mediterranean for Syrian, Asiatic, or\r Ægean commodities, which were then transmitted by the Egyptian merchants\r to the countries of the East and to Northern Africa.* The port of Tanis\r was one of the most secure and convenient which existed at that period.", "It was at sufficient distance from the coast to be safe from the sudden\r attacks of pirates,** and yet near enough to permit of its being reached\r from the open by merchantmen in a few hours of easy navigation; the arms\r of the Nile, and the canals which here flowed into the sea, were broad\r and deep, and, so long as they were kept well dredged, would allow the\r heaviest-laden vessel of large draught to make its way up them with\r ease.", "* It was from Tanis that the Egyptian vessel set out\r      carrying the messengers of Hrihor to Byblos.", "** We may judge of the security afforded by such a position\r      by the account in Homer which Ulysses gives to Eumaios of\r      his pretended voyage to Egypt; the Greeks having\r      disembarked, and being scattered over the country, were\r      attacked by the Egyptians before they could capture a town\r      or carry their booty to the ships.", "The site of the town was not less advantageous for overland traffic.", "Tanis was the first important station encountered by caravans after\r crossing the frontier at Zalû, and it offered them a safe and convenient\r emporium for the disposal of their goods in exchange for the riches of\r Egypt and the Delta.", "The combination of so many advantageous features\r on one site tended to the rapid development of both civic and individual\r wealth; in less than three centuries after its rebuilding by Ramses II.,\r Tanis had risen to a position which enabled its sovereigns to claim even\r the obedience of Thebes itself.", "We know very little of the history of this Tanite dynasty; the monuments\r have not revealed the names of all its kings, and much difficulty is\r experienced in establishing the sequence of those already brought to\r light.*\r \r \r * The classification of the Tanite line has been complicated in the\r minds of most Egyptologists by the tendency to ignore the existence\r of the sacerdotal dynasty of high priests, to confuse with the Tanite\r Pharaohs those of the high priests who bore the crown, and to identify\r in the lists of Manetho (more or less corrected) the names they are\r in search of.", "A fresh examination of the subject has led me to adopt\r provisionally the following order for the series of Tanite kings:--\r \r [Illustration: 397.jpg TABLE OF KINGS]\r \r Their actual domain barely extended as far as Siut, but their suzerainty\r was acknowledged by the Said as well as by all or part of Ethiopia, and\r the Tanite Pharaohs maintained their authority with such vigour, that\r they had it in their power on several occasions to expel the high\r priests of Amon, and to restore, at least for a time, the unity of the\r empire.", "To accomplish this, it would have been sufficient for them to\r have assumed the priestly dignity at Thebes, and this was what no doubt\r took place at times when a vacancy in the high priesthood occurred;\r but it was merely in an interim, and the Tanite sovereigns always\r relinquished the office, after a brief lapse of time, in favour of some\r member of the family of Hrihor whose right of primogeniture entitled him\r to succeed to it.* It indeed seemed as if custom and religious etiquette\r had made the two offices of the pontificate and the royal dignity\r incompatible for one individual to hold simultaneously.", "The priestly\r duties had become marvellously complicated during the Theban hegemony,\r and the minute observances which they entailed absorbed the whole life\r of those who dedicated themselves to their performance.**\r \r      * This is only true if the personage who entitles himself\r      once within a cartouche, the Master of the two lands, First\r      Prophet of Amon, Psiûkhân-nît, is really the Tanite king,\r      and not the high priest Psiûkhânnît.", "** The first book of Diodorus contains a picture of the life\r      of the kings of Egypt, which, in common with much\r      information contained in the work, is taken from a lost book\r      of Hecataeus.", "The historical romance written by the latter\r      appears to have been composed from information taken from\r      Theban sources.", "The comparison of it with the inscribed\r      monuments and the ritual of the cultus of Amon proves that\r      the ideal description given in this work of the life of the\r      kings, merely reproduces the chief characteristics of the\r      lives of the Theban and Ethiopian high priests; hence the\r      greater part of the minute observances which we remark\r      therein apply to the latter only, and not to the Pharaohs\r      properly so called.", "They had daily to fulfil a multitude of rites, distributed over the\r various hours in such a manner that it seemed impossible to find leisure\r for any fresh occupation without encroaching on the time allotted to\r absolute bodily needs.", "The high priest rose each morning at an appointed\r hour; he had certain times for taking food, for recreation, for giving\r audience, for dispensing justice, for attending to worldly affairs, and\r for relaxation with his wives and children; at night he kept watch, or\r rose at intervals to prepare for the various ceremonies which could only\r be celebrated at sunrise.", "He was responsible for the superintendence of\r the priests of Amon in the numberless festivals held in honour of the\r gods, from which he could not absent himself except for some legitimate\r reason.", "From all this it will be seen how impossible it was for a lay\r king, like the sovereign ruling at Tanis, to submit to such restraints\r beyond a certain point; his patience would soon have become exhausted,\r want of practice would have led him to make slips or omissions,\r rendering the rites null and void; and the temporal affairs of his\r kingdom--internal administration, justice, finance, commerce, and\r war--made such demands upon his time, that he was obliged as soon as\r possible to find a substitute to fulfil his religious duties.", "The force\r of circumstances therefore maintained the line of Theban high priests\r side by side with their sovereigns, the Tanite kings.", "They were, it is\r true, dangerous rivals, both on account of the wealth of their fief and\r of the immense prestige which they enjoyed in Egypt, Ethiopia, and in\r all the nomes devoted to the worship of Amon.", "They were allied to the\r elder branch of the ramessides, and had thus inherited such near rights\r to the crown that Smendes had not hesitated to concede to Hrihor the\r cartouches, the preamble, and insignia of the Pharaoh, including the\r pschent and the iron helmet inlaid with gold.", "This concession, however,\r had been made as a personal favour, and extended only to the lifetime of\r Hrihor, without holding good, as a matter of course, for his successors;\r his son Piônkhi had to confine himself to the priestly titles,* and his\r grandson Paînotmû enjoyed the kingly privileges only during part of his\r life, doubtless in consequence of his marriage with a certain Mâkerî,\r probably daughter of Psiûkhânnît L, the Tanite king.", "Mâkerî apparently\r died soon after, and the discovery of her coffin in the hiding-place at\r Deîr el-Baharî reveals the fact of her death in giving birth to a little\r daughter who did not survive her, and who rests in the same\r coffin beside the mummy of her mother.", "None of the successors\r of Paînotmû--Masahirti, Manakhpirrî, Paînotmû II., Psiûkhânnît,\r Nsbindîdi--enjoyed a similar distinction, and if one of them happened to\r surround his name with a cartouche, it was done surreptitiously, without\r the authority of the sovereign.**\r \r      * The only monument of this prince as yet known gives him\r      merely the usual titles of the high priest, and the\r      inscriptions of his son Paînotmû I.", "style him First Prophet\r      of Amon. His name should probably be read Paîônûkhi or\r      Piônûkhi, rather than Pionkhi or Piânkhi.", "It is not unlikely\r      that some of the papyri published by Spiegelberg date from\r      his pontificate.", "** Manakhpirrî often places his name in a square cartouche\r      which tends at times to become an oval, but this is the case\r      only on some pieces of stuff rolled round a mummy and on\r      some bricks concealed in the walls of el-Hibeh, Thebes, and\r      Gebeleîn.", "If the Psiûkhânnît, High Priest of Amon, who\r      once (to our knowledge) enclosed his name in a cartouche, is\r      really a high priest, and not a king, his case would be\r      analogous to that of Manakhpirrî.", "Paînotmû II.", "contented himself with drawing attention to his\r connection with the reigning house, and styled himself Royal Son of\r Psiûkhânnît-Mîamon, on account of his ancestress Mâkerî having been the\r daughter of the Pharaoh Psiûkhânnît.*\r \r      * The example of the royal sons of Ramses explains the\r      variant which makes Paînotmû, son of Manakhpirrî, into\r      Paînotmû, royal son of Psiûkhânnît-Mîamon.\r \r The relationship of which he boasted was a distant one, but many of his\r contemporaries who claimed to be of the line of Sesostris, and called\r themselves royal sons of Ramses, traced their descent from a far more\r remote ancestor.", "[Illustration: 401.jpg THE MUMMIES OF QUEEN MÂKERÎ AND HER CHILD]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-\r      Bey.", "The death of one high priest, or the appointment of his successor, was\r often the occasion of disturbances; the jealousies between his children\r by the same or by different wives were as bitter as those which existed\r in the palace of the Pharaohs, and the suzerain himself was obliged\r at times to interfere in order to restore peace.", "It was owing to an\r intervention of this kind that Manakhpirrî was called on to replace his\r brother Masahirti.", "A section of the Theban population had revolted,\r but the rising had been put down by the Tanite Siamon, and its leaders\r banished to the Oasis; Manakhpirrî had thereupon been summoned to court\r and officially invested with the pontificate in the XXVth year of the\r kings reign.", "But on his return to Karnak, the new high priest desired\r to heal old feuds, and at once recalled the exiles.* Troubles and\r disorders appeared to beset the Thebans, and, like the last of the\r Ramessides, they were engaged in a perpetual struggle against robbers.**\r \r      * This appears in the _Maunier Stele_ preserved for some\r      time in the Maison Française at Luxor, and now removed to\r      the Louvre.", "** The series of high priests side by side with the\r      sovereigns of the XXIst dynasty may be provisionally\r      arranged as follows:--\r \r [Illustration: 402.jpg TABLE]\r \r \r The town, deprived of its former influx of foreign spoil, became more\r and more impoverished, and its population gradually dwindled.", "The\r necropolis suffered increasingly from pillagers, and the burying-places\r of the kings were felt to be in such danger, that the authorities,\r despairing of being able to protect them, withdrew the mummies from\r their resting-places.", "The bodies of Seti I., Ramses II., and Ramses III.", "were once more carried down the valley, and, after various removals,\r were at length huddled together for safety in the tomb of Amenôthes I.", "at Drah-abul-Neggah.", "The Tanite Pharaohs seemed to have lacked neither courage nor good will.", "The few monuments which they have left show that to some extent they\r carried on the works begun by their predecessors.", "An unusually high\r inundation had injured the temple at Karnak, the foundations had been\r denuded by the water, and serious damage would have been done, had not\r the work of reparation been immediately undertaken.", "Nsbindîdi reopened\r the sandstone quarries between Erment and Grebeleîn, from which Seti I.", "had obtained the building materials for the temple, and drew from thence\r what was required for the repair of the edifice.", "Two of the descendants\r of Nsbindîdi, Psiûkhânnît I.", "and Amenemôpît, remodelled the little\r temple built by Kheops in honour of his daughter Honît-sonû, at the\r south-east angle of his pyramid.", "Both Siamonmîamon and Psiûkhânnît I.", "have left traces of their work at Memphis, and the latter inserted his\r cartouches on two of the obelisks raised by Ramses at Heliopolis.", "But\r these were only minor undertakings, and it is at Tanis that we must seek\r the most characteristic examples of their activity.", "Here it was that\r Psiûkhânnît rebuilt the brick ramparts which defended the city, and\r decorated several of the halls of the great temple.", "The pylons of this\r sanctuary had been merely begun by Sesostris: Siamon completed them,\r and added the sphinxes; and the metal plaques and small objects which he\r concealed under the base of one of the latter have been brought to light\r in the course of excavations.", "The appropriation of the monuments of\r other kings, which we have remarked under former dynasties, was also\r practised by the Tanites.", "Siamon placed his inscriptions over those of\r the Kamessides, and Psiûkhânnît engraved his name on the sphinxes and\r statues of Ame-nemhâît III.", "as unscrupulously as Apôphis and the Hyksôs\r had done before him.", "The Tanite sovereigns, however, were not at a loss\r for artists, and they had revived, after the lapse of centuries, the\r traditions of the local school which had flourished during the XIIth\r dynasty.", "[Illustration: 404.jpg THE TWO NILES OF TANIS]\r \r      Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-\r      Bey.", "One of the groups, executed by order of Psiûkhânnît, has escaped\r destruction, and is now in the Gîzeh Museum.", "It represents two figures\r of the Nile, marching gravely shoulder to shoulder, and carrying in\r front of them tables of offerings, ornamented with fish and\r garnished with flowers.", "The stone in which they are executed is of an\r extraordinary hardness, but the sculptor has, notwithstanding, succeeded\r in carving and polishing it with a skill which does credit to his\r proficiency in his craft.", "The general effect of the figures is a\r little heavy, but the detail is excellent, and the correctness of pose,\r precision in modelling, and harmony of proportion are beyond criticism.", "The heads present a certain element of strangeness.", "The artist evidently\r took as his model, as far as type and style of head-dress are concerned,\r the monuments of Amenemhâît III.", "which he saw around him; indeed, he\r probably copied one of them feature for feature.", "He has reproduced the\r severity of expression, the firm mouth, the projecting cheek-bones, the\r long hair and fan-shaped beard of his model, but he has not been able\r to imitate the broad and powerful treatment of the older artists; his\r method of execution has a certain hardness and conventionality which we\r never see to the same extent in the statues of the XIIth dynasty.", "The\r work is, however, an extremely interesting one, and we are tempted to\r wish that many more such monuments had been saved from the ruins of the\r city.*\r \r \r      * Mariette attributes this group to the Hyksôs; I have\r      already expressed the opinion that it dates from the XXIst\r      dynasty.", "The Pharaoh who dedicated it was a great builder, and, like most of\r his predecessors with similar tastes, somewhat of a conqueror.", "The\r sovereigns of the XXIst dynasty, though they never undertook any distant\r campaigns, did not neglect to keep up a kind of suzerainty over the\r Philistine Shephelah to which they still laid claim.", "The expedition\r which one of them, probably Psiûkhânnît II., led against Gezer, the\r alliance with the Hebrews and the marriage of a royal princess with\r Solomon, must all have been regarded at the court of Tanis as a partial\r revival of the former Egyptian rule in Syria.", "The kings were, however,\r obliged to rest content with small results, for though their battalions\r were sufficiently numerous and well disciplined to overcome the\r Canaanite chiefs, or even the Israelite kingdom, it is to be doubted\r whether they were strong enough to attack the troops of the Aramæan or\r Hittite princes, who had a highly organised military system, modelled\r on that of Assyria.", "Egyptian arms and tactics had not made much progress\r since the great campaigns of the Theban conquerors; the military\r authorities still complacently trusted to their chariots and their light\r troops of archers at a period when the whole success of a campaign was\r decided by heavily armed infantry, and when cavalry had already begun\r to change the issue of battles.", "The decadence of the military spirit\r in Egypt had been particularly marked in all classes under the later\r Ramessides, and the native militia, without exception, was reduced to a\r mere rabble--courageous, it is true, and able to sell their lives dearly\r when occasion demanded, rather than give way before the enemy, but\r entirely lacking that enthusiasm and resolution which sweep all\r obstacles before them.", "The chariotry had not degenerated in the same\r way, thanks to the care with which the Pharaoh and his vassals kept up\r the breeding of suitable horses in the training stables of the principal\r towns.", "Egypt provided Solomon with draught-horses, and with strong yet\r light chariots, which he sold with advantage to the sovereigns of the\r Orontes and the Euphrates.", "But it was the mercenaries who constituted\r the most active and effective section of the Pharaonic armies.", "These\r troops formed the backbone on which all the other elements--chariots,\r spearmen, and native archers--were dependent.", "Their spirited attack\r carried the other troops with them, and by a tremendous onslaught on the\r enemy at a decisive moment gave the commanding general some chance of\r success against the better-equipped and better-organised battalions that\r he would be sure to meet with on the plains of Asia.", "The Tanite kings\r enrolled these mercenaries in large numbers: they entrusted them with\r the garrisoning of the principal towns, and confirmed the privileges\r which their chiefs had received from the Ramessides, but the results of\r such a policy were not long in manifesting themselves, and this state\r of affairs had been barely a century in existence before Egypt became a\r prey to the barbarians.", "It would perhaps be more correct to say that it had fallen a prey to the\r Libyans only.", "The Asiatics and Europeans whom the Theban Pharaohs had\r called in to fight for them had become merged in the bulk of the nation,\r or had died out for lack of renewal.", "Semites abounded, it is true, in\r the eastern nomes of the Delta, but their presence had no effect on\r the military strength of the country.", "Some had settled in the towns\r and villages, and were engaged in commerce or industry; these included\r Phoenician, Canaanite, Edomite, and even Hebrew merchants and artisans,\r who had been forced to flee from their own countries owing to political\r disturbances.*\r \r      * Jeroboam (1 Kings xi.", "40, xii.", "2, 3) and Hadad (1

Lord,\r Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to\r destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people\r for his people.", "And the King of Israel went to his house heavy and\r displeased, and came to Samaria. This story was in accordance with the\r popular feeling, and Ahab certainly ought not to have paused till he had\r exterminated his enemy, could he have done so; but was this actually in\r his power?", "We have no reason to contest the leading facts in this account, or to\r doubt that Benhadad suffered some reverses before Samaria; but we may\r perhaps ask whether the check was as serious as we are led to believe,\r and whether imagination and national vanity did not exaggerate its\r extent and results.", "The fortresses of Persea which, according to the\r treaty, ought to have been restored to Israel, remained in the hands of\r the people of Damascus, and the loss of Ramoth-gilead continued to be a\r source of vexation to such of the tribes of Gad and Reuben as followed\r the fortunes of the house of Omri:* yet these places formed the most\r important part of Benhadads ransom.", "* And the King of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye\r      that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not\r      out of the hand of the King of Syria?\r \r The sole effect of Ahabs success was to procure for him more lenient\r treatment; he lost no territory, and perhaps gained a few towns, but he\r had to sign conditions of peace which made him an acknowledged vassal to\r the King of Syria.*\r \r      * No document as yet proves directly that Ahab was vassal to\r      Benhadad II.", "The fact seems to follow clearly enough from\r      the account of the battle of Karkar against Shalmaneser II.,\r      where the contingent of Ahab of Israel figures among those\r      of the kings who fought for Benhadad II.", "against the\r      Assyrians.", "Damascus still remained the foremost state of Syria, and, if we rightly\r interpret the scanty information we possess, seemed in a fair way to\r bring about that unification of the country which neither Hittites,\r Philistines, nor Hebrews had been able to effect.", "Situated nearly\r equidistant from Raphia and Carchemish, on the outskirts of the\r cultivated region, the city was protected in the rear by the desert,\r which secured it from invasion on the east and north-east; the dusty\r plains of the Haurân protected it on the south, and the wooded cliffs of\r Anti-Lebanon on the west and north-west.", "It was entrenched within these\r natural barriers as in a fortress, whence the garrison was able to\r sally forth at will to attack in force one or other of the surrounding\r nations: if the city were victorious, its central position made it easy\r for its rulers to keep watch over and preserve what they had won; if it\r suffered defeat, the surrounding mountains and deserts formed natural\r lines of fortification easy to defend against the pursuing foe, but\r very difficult for the latter to force, and the delay presented by this\r obstacle gave the inhabitants time to organise their reserves and bring\r fresh troops into the field.", "The kings of Damascus at the outset brought\r under their suzerainty the Aramaean principalities--Argob, Maacah, and\r Geshur, by which they controlled the Haurân, and Zobah, which secured\r to them Coele-Syria from Lake Huleh to the Bahr el-Kades.", "They had taken\r Upper Galilee from the Hebrews, and subsequently Perasa, as far as the\r Jabbok, and held in check Israel and the smaller states, Amnion and\r Moab, which followed in its wake.", "They exacted tribute from Hamath, the\r Phoenician Arvad, the lower valley of the Orontes, and from a portion\r of the Hittites, and demanded contingents from their princes in time\r of war.", "Their power was still in its infancy, and its elements were not\r firmly welded together, but the surrounding peoples were in such a\r state of weakness and disunion that they might be left out of account as\r formidable enemies.", "The only danger that menaced the rising kingdom was\r the possibility that the two ancient warlike nations, Egypt and Assyria,\r might shake off their torpor, and reappearing on the scene of their\r former prowess might attack her before she had consolidated her power by\r the annexation of Naharaim.", "END
