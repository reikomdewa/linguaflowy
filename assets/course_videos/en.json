addiction: BBC News Review", "language": "en", "content": "Chocolate bars and ice cream can be as addictive as drugs. Now some scientists think they should come with a warning. This is News Review from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil And I'm Beth. Make sure you watch to the end to learn vocabulary to talk about this story. Don't forget to subscribe to our channel, like this video and try the quiz on our website. Now, the story. The junk food. you love might soon have 'addictive' written on it. A major review has found that adding warning labels to ultra-processed food could stop people buying it. Researchers say these foods can have the same addiction symptoms as drugs. They estimate 1 in 7 adults and 1 in 8 children are already addicted to ultra-processed foods. You've been looking at the headlines, Beth. What's the vocabulary? We have: labelled, tackle and slapping. This is News Review from BBC Learning English. Let's have a look at our first headline. This is from Sky News. Some ultra-processed foods should be labelled 'addictive', scientists say. So, this headline is saying that some scientists think certain types of food, ultra-processed foods, should be labelled 'addictive'. Addictive, meaning something you cannot stop doing. But we're looking at 'labelled' and it contains the word 'label'. 'A label' – something you find, for example, on your clothes or on a packet, which has some information. It does, yeah. A label gives you information about the object that it's attached to, like your shirt. But here the headline is saying that ultra-processed food should literally come with a label that says 'addictive' on it. Right, so is that it? It's very literal. It's very clear, but I bet there's a metaphorical use as well. There is. So a person, an object, an activity can be labelled and this means described in a certain way, often unfairly. For example, maybe you tell one lie and now you're labelled a liar. Were you labelled anything at school, Neil? Maybe a troublemaker? No. I wasn't labelled a troublemaker, but maybe I was labelled a clown because I used to like to make funny jokes in the class. [laughs] Yeah. OK, let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. This is from The Times. Label ultra-processed foods 'addictive' to tackle obesity, say scientists. So, there's that word 'label' again that we've just been learning about. Scientists say we should label ultra-processed foods as 'addictive' so that we can help to tackle obesity and 'tackle' is the word we are looking at. 'Tackle' is a word familiar to every football fan. It's when you try to take the ball from the opposition. Is there any connection? Kind of. So, in football, the other team are the opposition and you want to beat them. Now, in the story, tackle is used metaphorically. Obesity is what we want to beat or deal with and that's why the headline says we want to tackle obesity. We need to deal with it. OK. So how else can we use 'tackle' in this metaphorical way? Well, police might tackle crime in a city. Lots of people are doing what they can to tackle climate change. That's right. I've started riding my bike to work to help tackle climate change. Let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. This is from the Daily Mail. Slapping junk food with 'addictive' warning labels could help end obesity, major review finds. So, addictive warning labels could be added to junk food. The word we're looking at is 'slapping'. Beth, what is 'slap'? It's this. Don't worry, that wasn't real, and slap in the headline is also not literal. It's metaphorical. So, 'slap' here means to put a label on to the junk food quickly and urgently. Yes, that's right. So, it's emphasising that the new labels should be added soon. It's an urgent situation and the use of slap, there's a kind of aggression about it as well. Now, Beth, can you give me 10 more examples please? 10? We don't have time for 10 more! That's ridiculous. Well Beth just slapped down my idea. And there's another use of 'slap' as a phrasal verb with 'down' and it means to criticise someone's suggestion. Let's look at that again. We've had: tackle – deal with, labelled – described in a specific way and slapping – attaching urgently.

This is News Review from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil. And I'm Beth. Make sure you watch to the end to learn vocabulary to talk about this story. Don't forget to subscribe to our channel, like this video and try the quiz on our website. Now, the story. Eight healthy habits in middle age may increase your life by more than twenty years. According to research, you can lengthen your life by doing regular exercise, having a healthy diet, positive social relationships and a regular sleep routine, and avoiding stress, smoking, opioid drugs and too much alcohol. The study was carried out over eight years and more than 700,000 Americans took part in it. You've been looking at the headlines, Beth. What's the vocabulary? We have: kicking habits, longevity and adopting. This is News Review from BBC Learning English. Let's have a look at our first headline. This is from The Independent. Kicking these eight habits could help you live 20 years longer, scientists say. So, kicking these habits can help you live longer. A habit is something that you do regularly. Sometimes a good thing, like exercise. Sometimes a bad thing, like smoking. But 'kick'? You kick a football. You can kick something away, but kick a habit? Well, think of the literal action of kick. If you kick a football, then you move it out of your way, possibly quite quickly and violently. So, if you kick a bad habit, like smoking or drinking too much alcohol, then your metaphorically forcing it away from you. You're stopping the habit. Yeah. And we use 'kick' and 'habit' together very regularly, especially to talk about something that you really want to stop doing. Beth, have you kicked a habit or is there one you really want to kick? Well, I'm trying to stop eating as much chocolate, but I haven't quite kicked the habit yet. What about you? I really want to kick the habit of checking my phone all the time. I do it so often. And it's a really bad thing. I want to kick that habit. Let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. This is from WorldHealth.net. These habits may help to extend your longevity by decades. So, this headline says that these habits will extend your longevity. 'Longevity' is the word that we're looking at. I can see it's got 'long' in it. Is there a connection? There is. 'longevity' is a noun and it means living for a long time. So, this headline is saying that having these habits will make you live longer. But there is another meaning to longevity, isn't there? Yes, if something is popular or useful for a long time we can say that it has longevity. Now, for example, flexible working could be important for longevity in a job, meaning that people will want to stay in their job longer if it's flexible. And take note – this word is quite formal, so it is usually seen more in writing than speaking. I wouldn't say 'Did you know that doing exercise helps your longevity?' I would say 'it helps you live longer'. Yes. Now take note about the pronunciation of this word – it's a little bit strange. It's longevity, so we have the /ŋ/ at the end of 'long' as normal, but then there's this /dʒ/ sound as well – longevity. Let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. This is from Perth Now. Adopting eight simple healthy habits could help increase your lifespan by decades, a survey finds. So, this headline is saying you can achieve 'longevity', that's the word that we just looked at, by adopting these habits. 'Adopting' is the word we're looking at now. Now, Beth, there was a kitten living in our street and it didn't have a home, so we brought it into our home to live. We adopted it. Well, that's very cute. 'adopt' can be when you take responsibility for something, like your kitten. If it's a child, then that is a legal process – you adopt a child. Now, Neil, when you adopted your kitten it became yours. And that idea is the same as in the headline with 'adopt'. It means taken and now belongs to you. Yes. So the headline is saying that you can take these healthy habits and apply them to yourself. Now, it's not just these habits that you can adopt, or kittens, or children. You can also adopt a new approach, for example. Or a person might adopt a new attitude. That's right. I watched a documentary about being vegetarian. Could I say that I have adopted a new diet? You could – it does sound a little bit formal. I understand what you mean, but probably you'd just say I've changed my diet, or I've changed the way I eat. Let's look at that again. We've had: kicking habits – stopping bad habits. longevity – living or lasting a long time, and adopting – taking as your own.

BBC News Review", "language": "en", "content": "Could a short sleep during the day. protect your brain? This is News Review from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth. And I'm Phil. Make sure you watch to the end to learn all the vocabulary that you need to talk about this story. And don't forget to subscribe to our channel, like this video and try the quiz on our website. Now, today's story. Our brains get smaller as we get older, but this doesn't happen as fast in people who take regular short sleeps during the day. That's according to a new study. Researchers suggest that these naps might reduce the risk of developing conditions like Alzheimer's in later life. You've been looking at the headlines. What's the vocabulary? We have 'power nap', 'sharp', and 'hinder'. This is News Review from BBC Learning English. Let's have a look at our first headline. This is from iNews. Power naps linked to greater brain capacity, scientists say. So brain capacity is about brain size and this headline says that it's linked to something called 'power naps'. Now we're going to look at this phrase 'power naps', but Phil, the word 'nap'. Isn't that a short sleep that babies have? Well, anyone can have a nap, but we're looking at 'power naps'. Now, these are short sleeps, usually during the working day in order to be able to do your job better. And in fact, maybe I should have a power nap after recording this. Well, that might be good for your brain. That's what this headline is saying, but there are other types of nap, aren't there? Yes, you might have heard of a 'cat nap' which is kind of similar, but it's not associated with work and we have other words to talk about sleep like 'snooze' or 'to nod off'  and many others. OK, well before our audience nods off. Let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. Yeah. This one is from the Times. Taking more naps could help you to stay sharp in later life. Now, again, we're talking about naps and this article refers to another study which suggested that having naps can help our brains perform better. The word. We're looking at is 'sharp' . Now, Phil. I know a sharp knife. But what is a sharp brain? Well, you've probably guessed that. It's a metaphor. If you describe someone as 'sharp'. It means they're alert and they can think quickly. Think about when you've had a good rest, and you're feeling good. Everything just seems to be a bit easier. Yep, and we use it to talk about people that always have a quick answer for something. We can say that they are sharp or that they have a sharp mind. Yes, and it's being used here to say that regular naps will keep your brain performing well. Yes, just like how practising your English every day will keep your language skills sharp. OK, let's look at that again. OK, next headline please. This one is from the Daily Express. Naps could help or hinder your health, depending on their length, study suggests. Now, this is actually referring to a different study and it says that long naps can be associated with obesity while shorter naps can reduce the risk of high blood pressure. We are looking at the word 'hinder'. And this is often used with the word 'help' isn't it. It is, but it means the opposite. To 'hinder' means 'to make things harder' or worse. Now, here we are looking at health. So, the headline is saying that some naps - shorter ones - are helpful. While others - longer ones - are unhelpful. That's right and 'hinder' is not that common in spoken English, but it is often used with the word 'help'. And that's because of those two 'h's. Hinder and help. So, for example, if something turns out to be less useful than you expected it to be. It might actually hinder rather than help you. I could also say that having to work hinders me being able to take naps regularly. That's right. OK, let's look at that again. We've had 'power nap'. A short sleep during the day. 'Sharp' - alert and quick thinking. 'Hinder' - to make something difficult or worse. Now, there's more about sleep in this video, where we ask 'are late nights bad for your health?'
