"en", "content": "Can music improve maths results? Scientists think so. This is News Review from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil. And I'm Beth. Make sure you watch to the end to learn vocabulary to talk about this story. Don't forget to subscribe to our channel, like this video and try the quiz on our website. Now, the story. Music makes you better at maths. That's according to a new study which found that maths test scores increased after musical activity. This includes singing, playing musical instruments, composing and just listening. Researchers say music makes maths more enjoyable and reduces fear and anxiety. You've been looking at the headlines, Beth, what's the vocabulary? We have taking up, the equation and do better. This is News Review from BBC Learning English. Let's have a look at our first headline. This is from Free Malaysia today. Want to be better at mathematics? Try taking up music. So, this headline is suggesting that if you want to improve your mathematics, you should take up music. Take up is the phrasal verb that we're looking at. Can you tell us about it? Yes. So, like all phrasal verbs, 'take up' has a lot of different meanings. Here it means to start something new like a hobby or an activity. So, the headline is saying take up music, meaning start doing a music-related activity, which will help you with your maths. Yes, but we can use 'take up' to talk about any activity that you start doing. Now, I was feeling a bit unfit recently, Beth. I wanted to improve my health. I decided to take up running. I started running as a hobby. Have you taken anything up recently? Yeah. Well, I started playing the piano. So, I could say that I have taken up the piano. Yeah. And it might help you with your maths as well. True. Let's look at that again. Let's look at our next headline. This is from Study Finds. Adding music to the equation leads to better math scores for kids. Yes. So, the headline explains the story. Music is good for improving children's ability at mathematics. We are looking at the words 'the equation' and we hear this connected to maths, Beth. I'm going to read one out. It's quite complicated. 3X + 1 = 19 if X = 6. That's an equation. Yeah. You're hurting my brain! That is a literal equation and it's very difficult. Now, it is a problem that needs solving and that is really key to understanding the metaphor 'the equation'. Yes. And so in this headline, the equation doesn't mean that kind of complex mathematical thing. It just means a complex situation. And the equation in this situation is maths, which is complicated for a lot of people and by adding music to the equation, it means that we're adding an extra element to an already complex situation. OK. So this is also definitely a bit of a clever headline. We can think of some other examples that aren't related to maths. So, dealing with climate change is a complex equation for governments because they want businesses to be happy, but they also have to follow green policies. And if you're starting a business, in general, you want to make as much money as you can. You also want to really please your customers so you need the right amount of staff. That is a difficult equation to work out. Let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. This is from The Good News Network. Children do much better in math when music is added to the lesson: new study. So, we are looking at the short phrase 'do better'. This is something, Beth, I used to hear all the time when I was at school. 'Neil, you can do better if you stop talking and pay attention.' OK, well, 'do better' means improve your performance. So your teachers thought you'd improve if you stopped chatting. This headline is saying that children will do better – improve at maths – if they do some kind of music-related activity. Can you give us another example? Yes. So, I support a football team, which is really bad – in the lowest division of English football. They could 'do better'. They could improve. We also can use this to talk about someone's health. So my auntie wasn't very well, but now she's doing better – she's improving. OK. And that's a good thing. We should mention that in the headline it's 'do much better'. You can also say 'do a lot better' or 'do significantly better'. Yeah. Now, Beth, you're presenting today has been OK. Thank you. I think you could do better, though. What?! Try to improve. Let's look at that again. We've had: taking up – starting a new activity, the equation – a complex situation and do better – improve performance. Now in six-minute English we talked about having a fear of numbers.

This is News Review from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil. And I'm Beth. Make sure you watch to the end to learn vocabulary to talk about this story. Don't forget to subscribe to our channel, like this video and try the quiz on our website. Now, the story. Eight healthy habits in middle age may increase your life by more than twenty years. According to research, you can lengthen your life by doing regular exercise, having a healthy diet, positive social relationships and a regular sleep routine, and avoiding stress, smoking, opioid drugs and too much alcohol. The study was carried out over eight years and more than 700,000 Americans took part in it. You've been looking at the headlines, Beth. What's the vocabulary? We have: kicking habits, longevity and adopting. This is News Review from BBC Learning English. Let's have a look at our first headline. This is from The Independent. Kicking these eight habits could help you live 20 years longer, scientists say. So, kicking these habits can help you live longer. A habit is something that you do regularly. Sometimes a good thing, like exercise. Sometimes a bad thing, like smoking. But 'kick'? You kick a football. You can kick something away, but kick a habit? Well, think of the literal action of kick. If you kick a football, then you move it out of your way, possibly quite quickly and violently. So, if you kick a bad habit, like smoking or drinking too much alcohol, then your metaphorically forcing it away from you. You're stopping the habit. Yeah. And we use 'kick' and 'habit' together very regularly, especially to talk about something that you really want to stop doing. Beth, have you kicked a habit or is there one you really want to kick? Well, I'm trying to stop eating as much chocolate, but I haven't quite kicked the habit yet. What about you? I really want to kick the habit of checking my phone all the time. I do it so often. And it's a really bad thing. I want to kick that habit. Let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. This is from WorldHealth.net. These habits may help to extend your longevity by decades. So, this headline says that these habits will extend your longevity. 'Longevity' is the word that we're looking at. I can see it's got 'long' in it. Is there a connection? There is. 'longevity' is a noun and it means living for a long time. So, this headline is saying that having these habits will make you live longer. But there is another meaning to longevity, isn't there? Yes, if something is popular or useful for a long time we can say that it has longevity. Now, for example, flexible working could be important for longevity in a job, meaning that people will want to stay in their job longer if it's flexible. And take note – this word is quite formal, so it is usually seen more in writing than speaking. I wouldn't say 'Did you know that doing exercise helps your longevity?' I would say 'it helps you live longer'. Yes. Now take note about the pronunciation of this word – it's a little bit strange. It's longevity, so we have the /ŋ/ at the end of 'long' as normal, but then there's this /dʒ/ sound as well – longevity. Let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. This is from Perth Now. Adopting eight simple healthy habits could help increase your lifespan by decades, a survey finds. So, this headline is saying you can achieve 'longevity', that's the word that we just looked at, by adopting these habits. 'Adopting' is the word we're looking at now. Now, Beth, there was a kitten living in our street and it didn't have a home, so we brought it into our home to live. We adopted it. Well, that's very cute. 'adopt' can be when you take responsibility for something, like your kitten. If it's a child, then that is a legal process – you adopt a child. Now, Neil, when you adopted your kitten it became yours. And that idea is the same as in the headline with 'adopt'. It means taken and now belongs to you. Yes. So the headline is saying that you can take these healthy habits and apply them to yourself. Now, it's not just these habits that you can adopt, or kittens, or children. You can also adopt a new approach, for example. Or a person might adopt a new attitude. That's right. I watched a documentary about being vegetarian. Could I say that I have adopted a new diet? You could – it does sound a little bit formal. I understand what you mean, but probably you'd just say I've changed my diet, or I've changed the way I eat. Let's look at that again. We've had: kicking habits – stopping bad habits. longevity – living or lasting a long time, and adopting – taking as your own.

BBC News Review", "language": "en", "content": "Could a short sleep during the day. protect your brain? This is News Review from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth. And I'm Phil. Make sure you watch to the end to learn all the vocabulary that you need to talk about this story. And don't forget to subscribe to our channel, like this video and try the quiz on our website. Now, today's story. Our brains get smaller as we get older, but this doesn't happen as fast in people who take regular short sleeps during the day. That's according to a new study. Researchers suggest that these naps might reduce the risk of developing conditions like Alzheimer's in later life. You've been looking at the headlines. What's the vocabulary? We have 'power nap', 'sharp', and 'hinder'. This is News Review from BBC Learning English. Let's have a look at our first headline. This is from iNews. Power naps linked to greater brain capacity, scientists say. So brain capacity is about brain size and this headline says that it's linked to something called 'power naps'. Now we're going to look at this phrase 'power naps', but Phil, the word 'nap'. Isn't that a short sleep that babies have? Well, anyone can have a nap, but we're looking at 'power naps'. Now, these are short sleeps, usually during the working day in order to be able to do your job better. And in fact, maybe I should have a power nap after recording this. Well, that might be good for your brain. That's what this headline is saying, but there are other types of nap, aren't there? Yes, you might have heard of a 'cat nap' which is kind of similar, but it's not associated with work and we have other words to talk about sleep like 'snooze' or 'to nod off'  and many others. OK, well before our audience nods off. Let's look at that again. Let's have our next headline. Yeah. This one is from the Times. Taking more naps could help you to stay sharp in later life. Now, again, we're talking about naps and this article refers to another study which suggested that having naps can help our brains perform better. The word. We're looking at is 'sharp' . Now, Phil. I know a sharp knife. But what is a sharp brain? Well, you've probably guessed that. It's a metaphor. If you describe someone as 'sharp'. It means they're alert and they can think quickly. Think about when you've had a good rest, and you're feeling good. Everything just seems to be a bit easier. Yep, and we use it to talk about people that always have a quick answer for something. We can say that they are sharp or that they have a sharp mind. Yes, and it's being used here to say that regular naps will keep your brain performing well. Yes, just like how practising your English every day will keep your language skills sharp. OK, let's look at that again. OK, next headline please. This one is from the Daily Express. Naps could help or hinder your health, depending on their length, study suggests. Now, this is actually referring to a different study and it says that long naps can be associated with obesity while shorter naps can reduce the risk of high blood pressure. We are looking at the word 'hinder'. And this is often used with the word 'help' isn't it. It is, but it means the opposite. To 'hinder' means 'to make things harder' or worse. Now, here we are looking at health. So, the headline is saying that some naps - shorter ones - are helpful. While others - longer ones - are unhelpful. That's right and 'hinder' is not that common in spoken English, but it is often used with the word 'help'. And that's because of those two 'h's. Hinder and help. So, for example, if something turns out to be less useful than you expected it to be. It might actually hinder rather than help you. I could also say that having to work hinders me being able to take naps regularly. That's right. OK, let's look at that again. We've had 'power nap'. A short sleep during the day. 'Sharp' - alert and quick thinking. 'Hinder' - to make something difficult or worse. Now, there's more about sleep in this video, where we ask 'are late nights bad for your health?'

Finn was small for  his age, and although he was quick on his feet, he was often scared of big, scary things. He  liked to stay in the safety of his cozy den, surrounded by his family. But he always dreamed of  being as brave as the other animals in the forest. One bright morning, the animals of the forest  gathered near the river for a special meeting. The wise old owl, Olivia, had some important  news. \"A great storm is coming,\" she said, \"and we must all help prepare for it.  The winds will be strong, and the rain will fall heavily. The river may flood, and we  need to make sure all the animals are safe.\" All the animals nodded, except for Finn.  He was worried. \"What if I’m not strong enough to help?\" he thought. \"I’m just  a little fox. What if I get scared?\" His mom, who was standing next to him, gave him  a gentle nudge. \"Remember, Finn,\" she whispered, \"bravery isn’t about being the biggest or  the strongest. It’s about doing what needs to be done, even when you’re scared.\" Finn nodded, trying to feel brave. As the animals began to work together, some went  to reinforce their homes, while others helped gather food. Finn, feeling nervous, decided he  would help by gathering sticks to build barriers along the riverbank to stop the flood. As Finn trotted toward the river, he noticed something that made his heart  race—a family of ducks was stuck on the other side of the rushing river, unable to cross.  The water was too fast, and they were in danger. Finn’s first thought was to run away. \"I  can’t help! The river is too dangerous!\" he thought. But then he remembered his mom’s words:  \"Bravery is about doing what needs to be done, even when you're scared.\" Taking a deep breath, Finn knew he had to do something. He ran back to  the other animals and told them about the ducks. “I think I can help!” he said, his voice shaking. The animals all looked at Finn, surprised. “You’re small,” said a bear, “the river is too big.” But Finn didn’t give up. “I’m small, but I can still try!” So, with the help of a few strong beavers who were great builders, Finn helped build  a small, sturdy bridge across the river. The water was high, but Finn bravely led the ducks to the  bridge, guiding them safely across, one by one. When the last duck made it to the  other side, the animals cheered. \"Finn, you did it!\" they shouted. \"You were so brave!\" Finn smiled, his heart filled with pride. He realized that bravery didn’t mean not  being scared; it meant facing your fears and doing what you could to help others. He  had helped save the ducks and kept them safe, even though he had been nervous. From that day on, Finn no longer let fear hold him back. He knew that  no matter how small you are, bravery lives inside everyone. And sometimes, it only  takes one brave step to make a big difference.
