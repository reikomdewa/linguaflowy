Rojo. El libro rojo. Aquí tenemos una ciudad, por ejemplo Madrid, Madrid es una ciudad, Barcelona es una ciudad,  Londres, Nueva York, Seúl, todos son ciudades. Así que aquí tenemos una ciudad. Y tiene muchos edificios: esto es  un edificio, esto es un edificio, y hay edificios grandes, grandes,  grandes, grandes, muy grandes. Y también hay edificios  pequeños, pequeños, pequeños. Aquí hay un edificio grande, edificio  grande y esto es un edificio pequeño. Y los edificios tienen muchas ventanas. A través de una ventana puedes ver  fuera o puedes ver dentro del edificio. Aquí, en esta página, hay un niño en una ciudad. La ciudad tiene muchos edificios, y también tiene un camión y un autobús. Y aquí hay una basura o una papelera, esto de aquí es una señal, aquí  hay otra señal, otra señal- y los edificios tienen muchas ventanas. El niño va caminando por  la calle y va muy abrigado porque hace mucho frío. Parece que estamos en invierno:  invierno, verano, primavera y otoño. Aquí estamos en invierno porque hay nieve. Entonces el niño va caminando por la  calle y de repente ve algo en la nieve. Algo de color rojo, lo coge y se lo lleva  sigue caminando con el libro en los brazos. Estos son mis brazos. En la siguiente página el niño está en clase. Los alumnos están sentados en sus pupitres, y hay muchos pupitres y sillas. Aquí están las ventanas y el profesor está  escribiendo, está escribiendo en la pizarra. Y aquí tenemos al niño y en su bolso en su mochila  tiene el libro rojo que ha encontrado en la nieve. Y dentro hay un mapa con muchas islas. Esto son islas rodeadas del mar. Y hay una isla en el centro, la isla más grande. Y entonces se va acercando más y más a esa  isla y ve a otro niño caminando en la arena, y ese niño también se encuentra un libro  rojo, ve un libro rojo en la arena. Lo coge y lo abre. Y dentro, dentro,  dentro del libro ve la foto de una ciudad. Tiene muchos edificios, y se acerca, se  acerca, se acerca y ve a un niño en clase, a través de una ventana. Se  están viendo el uno al otro. En esta página la clase se ha terminado: fin. Los niños están saliendo de la clase,  fuera. Y el niño se queda pensando. Aquí tenemos otra vez la clase y otro mapa:  este es el mapa del mundo, el mapamundi Y podemos ver que el niño se ha puesto su  abrigo, su bufanda, su gorro, y sus guantes, porque hace frío, para salir a la calle. En la siguiente página está el niño  y aquí hay dos basuras, dos papeleras, un edificio con ventanas, un camión y dos coches. Hay también varias señales: una,  dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, señales, y cruzando la calle hay un  señor vendiendo con globos. Está vendiendo los globos por dinero. Y en la siguiente página el niño tiene el  libro rojo debajo del brazo y está comprando. Está comprando con dinero los  globos, los está comprando al señor. Como hace mucho frío, el señor también  lleva una bufanda azul y guantes. Y en la siguiente página vemos como el niño,  con todos, todos los globos empieza a volar. A volar. A volar. Y se va lejos, lejos, lejos,  lejos de la ciudad. Muy lejos. Pero ¡Oh no! ¡Se le ha caído-! ¡Oy! Se me ha caído... El libro rojo, y se está  cayendo al suelo en la ciudad. El libro se ha caído al suelo de la ciudad. Y el niño, en la playa, lo  ve y se pone muy triste. Pero de repente ve que viene algo: viene algo. Viene su amigo con los globos y entonces  va a saludarle y a darle un abrazo. Mientras tanto el libro rojo en  el suelo de la ciudad se cierra. Se cierra- Y alguien se lo encuentra,  lo ve, otra vez. Otra vez. Aquí hay alguien con un zapato con cordones y  una rueda, esto es una rueda de una bicicleta. Y aquí vemos la bicicleta y el  niño montado en la bicicleta, que se ha puesto debajo del brazo,  debajo del brazo, el libro rojo. Y está mirando atrás. Con sus gafas mira hacia atrás mientras se  va lejos con el libro rojo en la bicicleta. Fin. Espero que a vosotros os haya gustado  y nos vemos la semana que viene. ¡Chao!", "sentences": ["Esto es un libro de color rojo.", "Rojo.", "El libro rojo.", "Aquí tenemos una ciudad, por ejemplo

Ballena (An original tale by TheFableCottage.com) Una vez hubo un pájaro que amaba a una ballena. Y una ballena que amaba a un pájaro. Al pájaro le encantaba la hermosa sonrisa de la ballena. Le encantaba cómo nadaba elegantemente por el agua. A la ballena le encantaban las bonitas plumas blancas del pájaro. Le gustaba mirar cómo se elevaba hacia el cielo. Durante el verano, el pájaro y la ballena se encontraron en la bahía. Hablaron y hablaron. Hablaron de la luna, de las olas, y de los barcos en el océano. El pájaro contó chistes que hicieron reír a la ballena. La ballena cantó hermosas canciones que hicieron llorar al pájaro. “Un día podrías conocer a mi familia en el océano”, dijo la ballena. “Y tú podrías conocer a mis amigos en la tierra”, dijo el pájaro. Todo era perfecto. Pero el mundo no para de girar solo porque un pájaro y una ballena se enamoran. El verano se transformó en otoño, y el otoño se transformó en invierno. El océano se volvió frío, y todas las ballenas partieron hacia aguas más cálidas. “Ven conmigo donde hay aguas cálidas”, dijo la ballena. “Es un lugar maravilloso. Siempre es cálido, y hay muchísimos peces para comer”. “Me encanta comer pescado”, dijo el pájaro. “Y me encanta estar contigo. Te seguiré a cualquier lugar. Pero primero, enséñame a ser una ballena”. “¡Así!”, dijo la ballena. “¡Sígueme!” y se sumergió en el agua. “¡De acuerdo!” dijo el pájaro, y él también se sumergió en el agua. Se sumergió más y más profundo. “¡Estoy nadando!” rió. “¡Soy una ballena!” Pero pronto no pudo respirar y regresó jadeando a la superficie. El pájaro intentó e intentó e intentó nadar, pero se quedó sin aliento cada vez. No creo que un pájaro pueda ser una ballena”, dijo el pájaro. “Mejor ven conmigo. Vivo arriba en los acantilados. Es un lugar maravilloso. Es cálido y acogedor, y cada mañana puedes ver el amanecer”. “Me encanta ver el amanecer”, dijo la ballena. “Y me encanta estar contigo. Te seguiré a cualquier lugar. Pero primero, enséñame a ser un pájaro”. “¡Así!”, dijo el pájaro. “¡Sígueme!” y batió sus alas y se elevó en el cielo. “¡De acuerdo!” dijo la ballena. Cerró los ojos con fuerza y batió sus aletas como el pájaro. Aleteó y aleteó, arriba y abajo. El agua salpicó en todos lados. “¡Estoy volando!” rió. “¡Soy un pájaro!” Pero cuando la ballena abrió los ojos, no estaba elevándose en el cielo. Todavía estaba en el agua. Ella intentó e intentó e intentó volar, pero no pudo. “No creo que una ballena pueda ser un pájaro”, dijo la ballena. “Tú no puedes volar y yo no puedo nadar. ¿Dónde podremos vivir juntos?” dijo el pájaro. “Nos quedaremos aquí — ¡en las olas!” dijo la ballena. Pero el pájaro sacudió la cabeza tristemente. “A ti te encanta nadar profundo en el océano”, dijo. “Eso es lo que más te gusta hacer. Nunca serás feliz aquí”. “Y a ti te encanta volar y planear en el cielo”, dijo la ballena. “Eso es lo que más te gusta hacer. Tú tampoco serás feliz aquí”. Y entonces, como el pájaro y la ballena se querían tanto, se dijeron adiós. Pero nunca se olvidaron el uno del otro. Cada vez que la ballena miraba un pájaro volando alto en el cielo, pensaba en su pájaro. Ella esperaba que él estuviera disfrutando de los cielos de esa manera. Y cada vez que el pájaro veía una ballena sumergiéndose profundo en el océano, pensaba en su ballena.

"language": "es", "content": "Cuando termines de ver este video,  en todo el mundo se habrán bebido 8 millones de tazas de café. El café se consume desde hace más de mil quinientos años y algunos dicen que su impacto  es tan grande que ayudó a impulsar la Ilustración, que dio lugar a algunas de las grandes ideas  que sustentan el mundo tal como lo conocemos. El principal ingrediente activo del café es  la cafeína, considerada la drogra psicoactiva más consumida en el planeta. Pero, ¿de dónde viene el café y cuál es su efecto cuando lo bebemos? Primero te cuento que proviene del fruto de la planta Coffea arábica, originaria de Etiopía. Según una leyenda, un pastor del siglo IX llamado Kaldi notó que sus cabras tenían más  energía después de comer bayas de café, así que también decidió probarlas Pero los registros históricos sugieren que fueron los sufíes de Yemen quienes  tostaron la semilla de la baya del café para crear la bebida que conocemos hoy. En el siglo XV, las primeras cafeterías comenzaron a aparecer en todo el Imperio Otomano. Y en los siglos siguientes se extendieron por toda Europa. Estos cafés europeos se convirtieron en un espacio para discutir  negocios, política y nuevas ideas. Y el filósofo Jurgen Habermas llegó a decir que  sin café no habríamos tenido la Ilustración. Y fueron justamente las ideas de ese movimiento  cultural e intelectual europeo, las que cambiaron radicalmente el mundo: llevaron al derrocamiento  de monarcas, al crecimiento de la democracia y a grandes descubrimientos científicos. ¿ Y qué tuvo que ver el café con todo eso? Aunque también el café tuvo un  papel en la trata de esclavos. Los franceses utilizaron esclavos de África  en las plantaciones de Haití y a principios del siglo XIX, Brasil producía un tercio del  café del mundo con mano de obra esclava. Algunos incluso dicen que ayudó  a impulsar el capitalismo. Pero avancemos hasta el presente:  actualmente se consumen 2 mil millones de tazas de café cada día. Es una industria que genera 90 mil millones de dólares al año. Y forma parte de la vida diaria de miles de millones de personas. Pero, ¿cómo afecta el café a nuestro organismo? Cuando la cafeína ingresa al sistema  digestivo, se absorbe a través del intestino e ingresa al torrente sanguíneo. Aunque sus efectos sólo comienzan a sentirse cuando llega al sistema nervioso. La cafeína tiene una estructura química muy similar a una sustancia producida por  nuestro propio cuerpo: la adenosina. La cafeína se une a los receptores de  adenosina del cuerpo, que se pueden encontrar en la superficie de las células nerviosas. Es como una llave que abre una cerradura. La adenosina es conocida por ralentizar el  sistema nervioso simpático y, por tanto, reduce el ritmo cardíaco y genera un  estado de somnolencia y relajación. Al bloquear estos receptores, la  cafeína genera el efecto contrario. La presión arterial, por ejemplo, puede  aumentar ligeramente, especialmente si no estás acostumbrado a tomar café con frecuencia. Lo mismo ocurre con la actividad cerebral: la cafeína estimula el cerebro, reduce  el hambre y ayuda a mantenerte alerta, para que puedas concentrarte por más tiempo. La cafeína puede tener un impacto positivo en el estado de ánimo, inhibir la sensación de fatiga  e incluso mejorar el rendimiento físico. Por eso muchos deportistas la  utilizan como complemento. Todos estos efectos pueden durar  entre 15 minutos y 2 horas. El cuerpo elimina la cafeína entre 5  y 10 horas después de su consumo. Aunque sus efectos residuales pueden durar más. Vale la pena recordar que la cafeína no solo se encuentra en el café, también  está en la yerba mate, el té verde, el guaraná y el cacao, entre otras plantas. También se añade a bebidas energéticas, refrescos y medicamentos. Lo que cambia es la concentración en cada producto. Por ejemplo, un expreso tiene cerca de 64 miligramos de cafeína mientras que  un té verde tiene 28 miligramos. Ahora, el café requiere cierto  cuidado al consumirlo. Para adultos sanos, el límite recomendado es 400  miligramos de cafeína por día, lo que equivale a unas cuatro o cinco tazas de café. Superar este límite puede provocar algunos efectos secundarios como insomnio, irritación,  ansiedad, taquicardia, malestar estomacal, náuseas y dolor de cabeza. Por supuesto, estos límites varían, especialmente porque algunas personas son  genéticamente más sensibles a la cafeína. Pero cuando se disfruta con moderación,  el café puede ser bueno para la salud. Y disminuir el riesgo de diabetes, de  algunas enfermedades cardiovasculares y hasta de Parkinson. Y estos beneficios para la salud no sólo están relacionados con la cafeína. El café tiene otras sustancias beneficiosas, como el ácido clorogénico, un poderoso antioxidante que  puede reducir el riesgo de muchas enfermedades.", "sentences": ["Cuando termines de ver este

Descubierto por casualidad por un pescador local… ...que se dio cuenta de que estaba ante  algo único cuando encontró este árbol caído. Entre las raíces, prácticamente camufladas,  había dos enormes vasijas de cerámica, enterradas durante siglos o quizá milenios. Estas vasijas son una pieza clave que está cambiando por completo lo que sabemos  sobre el pasado de la Amazonía y quienes la habitan desde hace miles de años. En este video te cuento cómo encontraron y qué se sabe de estas vasijas y cómo, gracias a  ellas, la Amazonía se ha convertido en la nueva frontera de la arqueología. Bueno, primero empecemos por el descubrimiento de las urnas en sí. Una historia que comenzó casi de casualidad, gracias a este hombre: Walfredo Cerqueira. Walfredo se dio cuenta de que era algo importante. Así que decidió comentar lo que  había visto con un sacerdote. Quien, a su vez, habló con los  arqueólogos del Instituto Mamirauá, en la ciudad de Tefé, también en el Amazonas. En enero, los investigadores iniciaron un largo trayecto hasta el lugar  donde se encontraron las urnas. Alrededor de 24 horas en barco, luego en canoa  a través de canales y arroyos en el Amazonas y una larga caminata por la selva cerrada. Pasaron cerca de un mes allí, trabajando con la comunidad local, para retirar las cerámicas  del enredo de tierra y raíces de manera segura En total se encontraron siete  vasijas, dos de ellas enormes: una de unos 350 kilos y otra de 180 kilos. Esto ayuda a entender el enorme esfuerzo que requirió moverlas: la misión necesitó la fuerza de  unas seis personas que tardaron casi un día entero en transportarlas por la senda —una senda que,  sin ese peso, normalmente recorren en una hora. Un análisis inicial halló huesos humanos  dentro de las vasijas, lo que indica que en realidad no eran vasijas, sino urnas funerarias. Pero ¿por qué este hallazgo es tan importante? Primero, encontrar vestigios arqueológicos  en un lugar húmedo y cálido como la Amazonía es muy difícil, ya que la mayoría de los  materiales biológicos se degradan con el tiempo. Segundo, la excavación ocurrió en una región  que pasó por un proceso ancestral conocido hoy como “aterrados y cavados”. Esto significa que, en el pasado, la población local desarrolló  una tecnología para crear islas artificiales en las llanuras inundables de los  ríos, para enfrentar las épocas de crecidas. Sacaban tierra de un lugar  y la acumulaban en otro. Eso les permitía mantenerse  en una posición estratégica. Otros estudios arqueológicos indican que  los habitantes tenían hábitos funerarios diferentes a los nuestros. Pero todavía hay muchas preguntas sin respuesta sobre estas urnas. El primer misterio tiene que ver con la propia cerámica, que parece diferente a otras tradiciones  ancestrales de producción que se habían descrito hasta ahora en la región amazónica. Los arqueólogos creen que datan de antes de la llegada de los europeos, en 1500, pero aún no  pueden precisar si tienen 500, mil o 3 mil años. Con la datación por carbono-14 y otras  pruebas sobre las evidencias arqueológicas, sería posible evaluar cosas como la edad,  el sexo y los hábitos alimentarios de las personas a las que pertenecían los restos. Pero los arqueólogos no pueden hacerlo por un motivo muy concreto: a pesar de la  importancia del hallazgo, falta financiación. En los últimos 20 años, la llegada de nuevas  tecnologías ha permitido comprender mucho mejor el pasado de los pueblos que vivían allí. Tecnologías como el secuenciamiento genético y aviones capaces de analizar el terreno en  busca de construcciones antiguas incluso en áreas de selva densa. Según los investigadores, también ha habido una transformación en la  forma de pensar y hacer investigaciones en la mayor selva tropical del planeta. Hoy se sabe que la Amazonía estuvo densamente poblada y que, en su apogeo,  antes de la llegada de los europeos, llegó a tener hasta 10 millones de habitantes. Hay evidencias de que esta selva tropical está habitada por pueblos indígenas  desde hace al menos 12.000 años. Y, a lo largo de ese tiempo, estas personas  —antepasados de los indígenas que viven allí hoy— construyeron ciudades, carreteras  y desarrollaron diversas técnicas para manejar la tierra, producir alimentos y  enfrentar las crecidas, como los mismos “aterrados y cavados” de los que hablamos antes. Y toda esta transformación en el conocimiento hace que muchos especialistas vean la Amazonía  como un monumento comparable a las grandes construcciones humanas de la Historia, como las  pirámides de Egipto o la Gran Muralla China. Al fin y al cabo, como muestran las evidencias,  la mayor selva tropical del mundo solo existe gracias al trabajo de las personas que  han vivido allí durante miles de años.", "sentences": ["Un tesoro
