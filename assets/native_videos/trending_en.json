(siren blaring) People scramble for cover (people screaming) as artillery shells (artillery shells blasting) are being fired in the distance. (artillery shells blasting) The people's Republic of China is bombarding the nearby Kinmen Islands in an attempt to take over control from the anti-communist Chinese. (tank rattling) (boots thudding) But troops on the islands fire back. (artillery shells blasting) Soon, artillery shells are raining down on both sides. (explosion thudding) (siren blaring) (tense music continuing) Back in Xiamen, (siren blaring) Inside one of these shelters is 21-year-old Chen Jingrun. As others are fidgeting impatiently, waiting for the explosions to stop, Chen is reading pages (explosion blasting) from a math book, (pages rustling) because he's on a mission to solve one of the oldest problems in math. (dramatic tense music) - A child can understand the statement, but the greatest geniuses in mathematical history have not been able to solve it. - In the year 2000, a publishing house even offered a $1 million prize to anyone who could solve the problem. But for nearly 300 years, everyone who has tried (dramatic music building) has failed. So the problem is this, can every even number greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes? - So that's the problem. So we can do some examples. (pen cap clicking) We can say, for example, 6. You know that's an even integer. So can we write it as the sum of two primes? So those are numbers that only divide by themselves and by 1. So for 6, it's just 3 plus 3, and we can do more and more numbers. So 10, for example, would be, you know, 5 plus 5, but also 7 plus 3. There's one I want to do, one extra, which is your favorite number. - 42. - 42. What makes it up? - 37 and 5. - 37. Yeah. But there's also a, sort of, nicer, more methodical, way of writing this out, and it will help us (paper rustling) build some intuition. - [Casper] We'll start by drawing two diagonal lines. (soft inquisitive music) - I'm building like a pyramid. A pyramid of prime numbers. (pen cap clicking) - [Derek] All right. - [Casper] So, we're gonna start at the top. We're gonna write down 2. Then we'll write down 3. 5. And this is gonna be a good test of how well I know my primes. Then we'll do the same on the other sides. Okay, and now, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna draw a line from each prime. Can you see where this is going? - [Derek] And where they cross is every sum? - [Casper] Yeah. Now I can start adding them. So we get 2 plus 2. - 4. - [Casper] 4. 3 plus 3. - 6. - 6. You can see, we're starting to get all these numbers. The main point here is just, as you go down, not only do you see all the even numbers appear, but they also seem to appear more frequently. And it seems like it should always happen. And, of course, the conjecture is that it does always happen, and that's known as the gold Goldbach's conjecture. - [Derek] Chen's obsession (mysterious gentle music) with the conjecture goes back to his high school years, when his teacher stood in front of the class telling the students all about the sciences, and said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences. Number theory is the queen's crown. And the Goldbach's conjecture is the pearl on the crown.\" (soft music continuing) - Shortly after, the teacher said, \"Well, perhaps, one day, one of you kids will solve it.\" And then the whole class burst out laughing. (people laughing) Everyone except for Chen Jingrun. (inspiring classical music) He later said, \"I did not laugh. I did not dare to laugh. I was worried my classmates would know my vision, but I never forgot this lesson to always remember the pearl on the crown, and to never forget my aspirations or ideals.\" - [Derek] And now, (alarm blaring) as air raid alarms are ringing, he's maintained his vision. (alarm blaring) He's working on his math, trying to solve Goldbach's conjecture. - And then it's like, well, who the hell is Goldbach? (playful classical music) Do you know a Goldbach? - I know nothing about Goldbach. - Christian Goldbach is a little known Prussian mathematician who grew up in the early 1700s. At first, (paper rustling) he mostly studied medicine and law, only occasionally dabbling in mathematics. But then in 1710, at the age of 20, he set off on a 14 year, and over 4,000 kilometer long, journey to meet some of the greatest mathematicians alive. (playful classical music playing) In Leipzig, he met with Gottfried Leibniz, the co-inventor of calculus. And, in London, he met with both Nicolaus Bernoulli, and, perhaps the greatest mathematician of all time, Sir Isaac Newton. (classical music continuing) He then finished this trip around Europe before ultimately settling down in Russia at the newly formed St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. (waves crashing) (seagulls cawing) Where, in 1727, he met his most important connection, a 20-year-old math prodigy. Can you guess who? - Leonard Euler? - Leonard Euler. (both laughing) - The two quickly became friends, bonding over a shared obsession with number theory. Then, in 1729, Goldbach moved to Moscow, but the two stayed in touch, writing letters to each other for the next 35 years, literally until Goldbach died. (tense fast music playing) (wind whooshing) It was in one of these letters, (paper rustling) on the 7th of June, 1742, where Goldbach scribbled a line in the margin. It was not the exact form of the conjecture which now bears his name, but something related. (wind whooshing) \"It seems that every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" (slow classical music) Euler was intrigued by the proposition, but he thought the idea could be refined further. It made sense to him that odd numbers might need three numbers to add together to make them, but then he turned his attention to even numbers, and he thought, \"Well, with even numbers, perhaps just two prime numbers would be enough to sum to give you every even number.\" In fact, as Euler wrote in his letter, this is how Goldbach originally framed the problem in person. So, Euler reformulated Goldbach's idea (wind whooshing) into two separate conjectures. (wind whooshing) The first dealt with odd numbers, and said, \"Every odd number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" This became known as the weak Goldbach conjecture. And the second (wind whooshing) dealt with even numbers. It said, \"Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.\" This became known as the strong Goldbach conjecture. (wind whooshing) (playful gentle music) They get their names strong and weak conjecture, because (wind whooshing) if you have the strong conjecture, then you've shown that every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of just two primes. And then you can add three (wind whooshing) to each of those sums to get all of the odd numbers. So if you can prove the strong conjecture, you get the weak one for free. But the reverse is not true. If you can prove the weak conjecture, you still don't get the strong one. Now, after Euler reformulated these conjectures, he was so confident they were true, that he wrote, \"I regard this as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.\" - And he couldn't, you know? And for the next 150 years, almost no progress is made. (cymbals crashing) - [Derek] That is until, in 1900, German mathematician David Hilbert addressed the International Congress of Mathematicians, in Paris. (paper rustling) And there, he listed 23 of the most important problems for the 20th century. (pages rustling) Number eight on that list was all about prime numbers, including Goldbach's conjecture. (pen scratching) - Goldbach's conjecture was back on the radar. Only now, mathematicians started to look at the problem differently. (gentle inquisitive music) - [Derek] Let's take a look at our pyramid again. One thing to notice is that this pyramid is symmetrical. When two primes add to make an even number on the right side, those same two primes make an even number on the left side. So, to avoid double counting, we can look only at the right side of this center line. And what we find is that for very small even numbers, like 4, 6, or 8, well, there's only one way to write them as the sum of two primes. But for larger numbers, like 20, well, now there are multiple different ways to write it as the sum of two primes, and the further down you go, the more combinations you find. - So, mathematicians started asking a new question, not just whether every even number can be written as the sum of two primes, but in how many different ways it can be done. - [Derek] Let's call that number H of N. For example, H of 4 is 1, because you can only write 4 as the sum of primes 2 plus 2. H of 20 is 2, because that is 3 plus 17, and 7 plus 13. H of 42 is 4, and so on. (bubble popping) Now, so far, we're just counting up what the value of H should be. But in 1923, two English mathematicians, G. H. Hardy and John Littlewood, tried to come up with a function that would estimate H of N. To do it, they relied on one of the most important results from number theory, the prime number theorem. (harp chiming) (bright classical music) This tells you that, on average, a large number in the neighborhood of N, has 1 over the natural logarithm of N chance of being prime. So here's a crude version of what Hardy and Littlewood did. They imagined this large even number, and they said it equal to 2N. So you could split it right down the middle at N. Now they considered a pair of numbers, A and B, that together add up to 2N. Where A is smaller than N, and B is larger. They both must differ from N by the same amount. Let's call it C. Now, according to the prime number theorem, the chance that A is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N - C. And the chance that B is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N plus C. But here's the trick. - Most of the times we're talking about Ns that are ginormous, that are super, super large. And if you look at 1 over L and N, that function would be something like this. Where, basically, it drops very quickly at the start. And, for large numbers, it's almost constant. So that this C really doesn't affect it a whole lot. So, for most of the numbers, we can, sort of, ignore the C, in both cases, and it becomes much simpler, which is just the chance of A being prime is about 1 over L and N, and the chance of B being prime is about 1 over L and N. Now, what's the chance that both are prime? - [Derek] You're gonna multiply 'em together, - We're gonna multiply them together - [Derek] Still, so far we've just looked at one pair, while, in total, there are about N possible pairs, N ways to add up two numbers to get to 2N. So we can just multiply the chance of one pair being prime with the total number of pairs, to find the total expected number of prime pairs, which comes out to about N over ln N squared. And if we plot this, we find that the expected number of ways to write any number as the sum of two primes increases for larger and larger numbers. - Hardy and Littlewood, they refined this a bit more, but essentially what they find, you know, is the exact same thing. They just have like a correction factor in front, but then this term is still the same. - [Derek] The only problem is that this is just an estimate, not a proof. And as they point out in their own conclusion, \"It is only proof that counts.\" - And that's about as far as they get for the strong Goldbach conjecture. But on the weak one, they have more success. (inquisitive pulsing music) - [Derek] It all comes back to a curious incident 10 years earlier, in 1913. We've invited Elmer, from the YouTube channel, Fern, to tell you about it. (tense inquisitive music) - [Elmer] Hardy sits at his breakfast table, when a strange letter arrives. (inquisitive music continuing) It's sent by a completely unknown mathematician from India, (camera clicking) Srinivasa Ramanujan. The letter reads, \"I'm now about 23 years of age. I have no university education, but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school, I've been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at mathematics.\" Ramanujan writes that he's a poor clerk, earning only about 20 pounds a year. He's attached some formulas and is asking for Hardy's opinion. The letter is over 10 pages long and is packed with over 100 theorems, many of them highly advanced, (clicker clicking) yet Ramanujan provides no proofs and very little explanation. Hardy is astounded. He has never seen anything like it. Some are already known, (clock ticking) others are completely new, (clock ticking) unknown to the world. (clock ticking) And then there are results (clock ticking) that seem impossible. (clock ticking) Like that the sum of all positive integers up to infinity is negative 1 12th. How did he come up with this? (shutter clicking) (inquisitive music continuing) Hardy shows a letter to Littlewood. The two stay up until midnight going through the manuscript, debating whether the mysterious author is a genius or a fraud. - But it sounded like Hardy felt these couldn't be crank results because you couldn't imagine them if you were just a crank. They're too fantastical to be the the work of that kind of second rate mind. Only a really phenomenal, off-the-chart, genius could have come up with them. - [Elmer] So Hardy writes back. The rigorous and strict mathematician he is, he asks for proof. (birds tweeting) Ramanujan, however, is nothing like Hardy. He works on intuition, often guided by dreams. - He would just see the result, or in some mystical versions of his own telling, he would say that his personal goddess, Namagiri, would come to him in his dreams, and write the formulas on his tongue. - Wait on his tongue? - On his tongue is the version I've sometimes heard. But in any case, she planted it in his mind. - [Elmer] \"An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.\" Ramanujan never really learned how to provide proof to his theorems. So Hardy urges him to come to Cambridge to explain them in more detail. But there's a problem. (bird tweeting) Ramanujan is a devout Hindu. His faith forbids him from crossing the sea. Then one night his mother has a dream, (harp trilling) a goddess appears, and tells her to let Ramanujan fulfill his destiny. Convinced by the vision she gives her blessing. (camera clicking) And so, Ramanujan finally sets out for England. (inspiring music playing) In Cambridge, Hardy and Ramanujan start working together. - I mean, I'm gonna get choked up thinking about it. It's such a beautiful sentiment. Trying to remember how Hardy put it. It's something like he thought, (gentle music continuing) you know, on a scale from 0 to 100, you know, maybe he's a 10. Littlewood is a 30. Like Ramanujan is an 80, some kind of crazy thing like that. So he knew that Ramanujan was special. Hmm, didn't expect to get emotional for you, but this is what I do when I think about Ramanujan. (Professor Strogatz laughing) - [Elmer] But his new life in England is harsh. He's not used to the climate, (emotional string music) he's not used to the food, and war is ravaging. It will become one of the darkest chapters of his life. If you wanna know more about Ramanujan's struggles, and what made him such a genius, there's an upcoming video on our channel, Fern. - [Derek] While Ramanujan struggled, Hardy and he did make a breakthrough. (hopeful classical music playing) Around 1917, they invented what's known as the circle method, and used it to tackle different problems in number theory. Hardy and Littlewood later developed this idea further, and for the next a hundred years, this would be the main method to tackle the weak Goldbach conjecture. - But let's remind ourselves of the problem. We're trying to prove that we can always write an odd number, large odd number, as the sum of three primes. Call it P1, P2, and P3. (gentle inquisitive music) - But just like before, we don't only want to know whether it's possible, but in how many different ways it can be done. So, Hardy and Littlewood imagined a counting machine of sorts. As input, it would take all possible combinations of three prime numbers smaller than N. (machine ticking) For each combination it would add them up and check if that sum is equal to N. And, if it is, the machine increments a counter by 1. (bell dinging) But if not, the machine does nothing. (bell dinging) It goes on (machine whirring) to the next combination. (machine whirring) Let's do an example. (machine whirring) Say N is 11. Well, the machine first checks the primes 2, 2, and 2, adds them up to get 6, (machine whirring) which is not equal to 11. So the counter stays at 0. (bell dinging) Next it tries 2, 2, 3, which is 7. So again, it does nothing. (bell dinging) And it keeps cycling through until it hits 2, 2, 7, (bell dinging) which is equal to 11. (machine whirring) So now the machine increments the counter (bell dinging) by 1. As it keeps running through primes, the counter increments only one more time for 3, 3, 5. (bell dinging) (machine whirring) So in total, there are two ways to write 11 (bell dinging) as the sum of three primes. But how would you go about building this machine out of mathematics? (pen scratching) Because that is exactly what Hardy and Littlewood did. Their technique is so ingenious, I want to take you through it step by step. It starts with the function E to the I theta. This function just traces out a unit circle in the complex plane. The angle theta determines how far around the circle you are. Now imagine that theta is restricted to be some multiple M of 2 pi. And since 2 pi is one complete revolution, it doesn't matter if M is 0, 1, 2, 3, or any integer, a vector from the origin would always point in the same direction, to the right. But now Hardy and Littlewood multiply the angle by alpha, where alpha is just some number between 0 and 1. You can think of it as a slider. So if M equals 1, and you increase alpha from 0, well, the vector slowly makes one full rotation. If M equals 2, the vector will move around faster and make two full rotations. And this keeps going for higher values of M. Now imagine taking all possible values of alpha simultaneously, and then averaging out all of those vectors. Mathematically, we can write this as the integral from 0, to 1 of E of the I 2 pi alpha, D alpha. So what happens? Well, this vector cancels with this one on the opposite side, and this one with that one. And the same thing happens with all the vectors. So, averaging them, we get 0. The same thing happens if M equals 2, or 3, or 4. This integral will give 0 for all values of M. Except a single case. If M equals 0, then we have E to the 0 which equals 1. So no matter what alpha is, the vector always points to the right, and averaging that will always give 1. So this equation is very close to the machine we were trying to create. If M equals 0, it returns 1, (bell dinging) but if M is not equal to 0, it returns 0. (bell dinging) So all that's left to do is replace M with what we're interested in. Specifically, is the sum of P1 plus P2 plus P3 equal to N? We can rearrange that to get P1 plus P2 plus P3 minus equals 0. So, if we sub in this expression for M, then every time the three primes add up to N, this value will be 0, and the integral (bell dinging) will be equal to one. And every time the primes don't add up to N, this value will be non-zero. And so the integral will return 0. (bell dinging) But, right now, this equation only checks one triplet of primes. To check all possible combinations of primes smaller than N, we need to add a sum. Since this will count up all the ways three primes can add to make N, we can call it H of N. So in fact, let's try it out. Put in N equals 11, compute this function, and it gives 6. (wind whooshing) (paper rustling) Which is not the 2 we found before. So what happened? Well, we've simplified the logic a little bit, so we actually get some duplicates this time. For example, the machine finds 2, 2, 7, but also 7, 2, 2, and 2, 7, 2. Mathematicians correct for this when doing the real calculation, but for our purposes, this machine is good enough. So we've got our H of N, and if we can show that H of N is at least 1 for every odd number greater than 5, then we've proven the weak Goldbach conjecture. But there are two issues with this approach. The first is that we assumed that we know all of the prime numbers smaller than N, which is true when N is small. But as N goes to infinity, we just don't know all of the primes. The second problem is that, as the number of primes increases, the number of possible combinations explodes. If N is 10,001, there are 1,229 smaller prime numbers, which means a total of 310 million, 144 thousand, 296 possible prime triplets. Increase N to a billion, and the possible combinations jumps up to nearly 22 sextillion. (soft piano music playing) And this trend continues. So, using this approach in a simple way won't work. So Hardy and Littlewood came up with a smarter way. They fundamentally reframed the problem by taking the sum inside the integral. Rather than checking all possible combinations of prime numbers by brute force, they now analyze the collective behavior of all the primes at once. To see how this works, take a look at the equation. In the exponent is the sum of three primes minus N, but adding in the exponent is the same as multiplying exponentials together. So we can rewrite this as the product of four exponentials. The first three of these are actually identical because there's nothing to distinguish what we call P1, P2, P3. They're all prime numbers drawn from the same set. So we could just call this function S of alpha and N, and we could multiply it by itself three times, or just cube it. By doing this, H of N is now a function of just two things, E to the minus I two pi N alpha, which is just a complex number that you could compute, and this new function, S of alpha and N. But what is this function? Well, let's do an example. Again, say N equals 11. Then S of alpha and 11 equals just a sum of four exponentials, each governed by its own prime number. You can think of each of these exponentials as a clock, each with its own prime number that determines how fast the clock spins. So 2 turns the slowest, 3 turns faster, 5 turns faster still, and so on. But remember, this is a sum. So we actually need to add up all the clocks tip to tail. Now watch what happens as we increase alpha. All the clocks wind around at their own rates. What we're interested in is not the behavior of any individual clock, but instead all of them together. Since we've chosen a pretty small value for N, nothing too exciting happens, but watch what happens if we pick a larger value for N, like 99. Now there are 25 prime numbers that are smaller than 99, and hence 25 clocks in our sum. Now as we increase alpha, all the clocks, again, wind around at their different rates. It almost looks like a dragon's tail. And for a while everything seems kind of chaotic, circling around the origin, but then, when alpha hits 1 over 6, the tail unwinds, and suddenly almost all the clocks point in a similar direction, and we get a large resultant value. If we increase alpha further, the clocks cancel out again until we hit the next magic point, 1 over 3. Here again, many clocks line up. And this curious pattern keeps repeating. For the majority of values of alpha, the clocks cancel each other out. But at a few special points, like a half, the tail unwinds, the clocks interfere constructively, and we get a large resultant value. - If the angle is, you know, 360 degrees divided by a whole number, you get some very particular behavior that's very predictable. Those are the angles at which this function, when you sum the primes, they actually go far from from 0. And what happens at a random angle, and you just start adding the primes up, it keeps changing which way it's pointing, and the thing just bounces around. - So why is this happening? Well, let's look at when alpha equals a half. Here what we're doing is multiplying each prime number in the exponent by a half. In other words, dividing each prime number by 2. So let's do this for each of the primes. In the first column, we'll write down how many times it can be divided by 2. And in the second column we'll write down the remainder. So 2 divided by 2 equals 1, leaving a remainder of 0. So we've just made one full rotation. 3 divided by two is 1, but that leaves a remainder of 1, so it makes one full rotation and then a half rotation. 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So it makes two full rotations and then a half rotation more. Now, we don't really care about the first column because it doesn't matter how many full rotations a clock makes, we only care about where the arrow ends up. And that's fully determined by the remainder. It's just the remainder times alpha. So from now on we'll just keep track of the remainders. And what we find is that all of the other remainders are equal to 1. So all clocks, except the first one, point the same way. This is because when we're dividing whole numbers by 2, there are only two possible remainders, 0 or 1. And since we're working with prime numbers, only 2 can have the remainder 0, because no other prime number is even, therefore, all other primes must share the remainder 1. (wind whooshing) Meaning all those clocks end up making another half rotation, so they all point left and constructively interfere. (wind whooshing) A similar thing happens when alpha equals a third. Now each prime is divided by 3. So the possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2. Again, 3 is the only clock that has remainder 0, so that points right. But all the other primes follow a special pattern, a pattern that makes the entire circle method possible. The remaining primes distribute themselves roughly equally between remainders 1 and 2, which means all the remaining clocks are rotated one third or two thirds of the way around the circle. Since these clocks are pointing to the left, again, we get constructive interference. And this pattern of constructive interference also occurs for other small rational fractions. But for non-rational numbers, you don't get these nicely restricted remainders. So the clocks are roughly distributed equally all over the circle, and you get destructive interference. (upbeat tense music playing) Hardy and Littlewood realized they could use this. Imagine taking this plot of the magnitude of the resultant arrow and wrapping it around a circle. What they found is that the majority of the contributions come from very small regions of the circle, what they called the major arcs. The rest of the circle only adds minor contributions. So they called these the minor arcs. This allowed them to split up their calculation into two parts. The major arc part gives you the main term for how many ways you can write a number N as the sum of three primes. And the minor arcs just gives you an error term. (upbeat classical music playing) They then showed that, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then the main term grows faster than the error term. So eventually, for some large enough number, call it K, this value will always be larger than 1, and the weak Goldbach conjecture holds. But there are two problems with this approach. The first is that they assumed that a generalization of the Riemann's hypothesis is true, which we don't know. And the second is that they didn't actually specify that number, K. I mean, how big of a number do you need to get to before you can guarantee that all numbers larger than that adhere to Goldbach conjecture? - Then we've got to wait until 1937 when Russian mathematician, Ivan Vinogradov, proves the same as Hardy and Littlewood. But he did it without the generalized Riemann hypothesis. So, you know, assumption free. - It's one thing to just assume the Riemann hypothesis, and say, \"Oh yeah, you can make some progress.\" But Vinogradov's like, \"No guys, you don't need the Riemann hypothesis. You can really prove this stuff.\" - But again, he gives some large enough number for which the weak Goldbach conjecture will hold without specifying that number. And so it's very unsatisfying. (bright classical music) Over the next 19 years, one of his students did get that satisfaction when he could specify that number. Do you want to have any guess as to what the number is? - 10 to the 50? 10 to the 80? 10 of the 3000? I don't know. I was guessing things that are far too low, probably. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's about 10 to the 6.8 million. - Wow, okay. - It's huge. But then you know, from here on, people start working on this method more, and they all use the same techniques. In 1989, the number was brought down to 10 to the 43,000. Next it dropped to 10 to the 7,194. And by 2002 it had dropped all the way down to 10 to the 1,346. Now that seems so much smaller than what we had before, but if you compare it to how many, you know, protons there are in the universe, which is 10 to the power 80, that's not something you can check by computer. It's absolutely, absolutely hopeless. Even if you turned the whole universe into a computer, you would still have no chance of solving this. So it really needed to get dragged down. - [Derek] This is roughly where the problem stood in 2005, when, Peruvian mathematician, Harald Helfgott became interested in it. (upbeat classical music playing) - He was reading papers about the weak Goldbach conjecture, and new techniques that were being developed. So these were the cutting edge techniques at the time. He was reading it and he thought. - I can do better. I'm having some ideas how to do better. And, you know, it took me a couple of weeks to get better estimates. Not still, you know, strong enough to revolutionize everything, but to make real progress. - So he gets to work and within a couple of weeks he's got better estimates than that in the paper. So now he's getting more confident, like, \"Okay, I got this.\" - Of course, I was a bit naive. I underestimate some difficulties elsewhere. (upbeat bright string music) - To solve the problem, he realized he needed to do two things. One, get the computational number as high as possible, and two, get the constant down as much as he could, which is where the difficult math comes in. So, over the next eight years, he attacked the problem from both sides. Together with David Platt, he checked all numbers up to 8.8 times 10 to the 30 by computer. And by refining his math, he slowly brought down the constant number, K. (numbers ticking) By 2013, he gets the number all the way down to 10 to the 27, which is below the number that his computers had already checked. - So he solved it. He wrote up his results in a paper called \"The Ternary Goldbach Conjecture is True,\" which is quite the mike-drop title. So, nearly 300 years after Goldbach's original letter, Helfgott proved that every odd number greater than five can be written as the sum of three primes. And as a result, he also proved that every even number greater than 2, can be written as the sum of at most four primes. This is because you can always just add 3 to all the odd numbers to get all the even numbers. - So was it a big deal? Were people excited? (playful gentle music playing) - Yeah, it's a good question. I feel like it is mostly an obscure problem. I think the strong one, and this with both of these problems, like they don't have any direct application to the real world. (inquisitive music continuing) Because it's so simple, it has this massive wide appeal, and everyone will kind of know about it. It's also one of the oldest unsolved problems. What did you do when you proved it? - Well, I put it on the archive. Like any normal person. It was a big relief. - You know, given your success (playful piano music playing) with the weak form of the Goldbach conjecture, how do you feel about the strong form? - Oh, I think that's hopeless for the moment. (Casper laughing) And if it yields. If it were to yield during our lifetimes, I wouldn't bet on it, in fact, I would bet against it. - See, the reason the circle method works for the weak Goldbach conjecture is because this main term grows faster than this error term. But that's not the case for the strong Goldbach conjecture. - The major arcs are no longer major. The main contribution comes from the minor arc. So at least as much of the contribution comes from the minor arcs. - So, to solve the strong conjecture, we need some fundamentally new technique, or approach, but we haven't found it yet. (tense classical music playing) - The person who arguably got the closest was Chen Jingrun. (pen scratching) In 1956, Chen was recognized for his mathematical prowess, and, a year later, he became an assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he spent the next 10 years working on problems in number theory, including Goldbach's conjecture. By 1966, he hit a major breakthrough. By using another approach, known as sieve methods, he proved that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and a number that's either a prime, or the product of exactly two primes, what we call a semi prime. - It's a very learned and brilliant proof. I think Andre Weil compared following his proof, is like climbing along the top of the Himalayas. (wind whooshing) You know, that you're way up high in (laughing) practically the stratosphere. It's such a sophisticated argument. - This was the closest anyone had gotten to solving the problem. (playful music continuing) Elated, Chen showed the proof to a colleague, who suggested he should announce the result, and then tidy it up before publishing. - But just as Chen announced his result, the country plunged into chaos. (dramatic music) (crowd shouting) - [Derek] In May, 1966, chairman of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, declared that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society, and they must be purged. This marked the start of the Cultural Revolution, a radical campaign to defeat perceived enemies of the Party. With support from Mao, militant student revolutionaries, known as the Red Guard, (soldiers marching) stormed institutions. (soldiers marching) They burned books and turned on intellectuals. Teachers, scientists, and professors were subjected to brutal public spectacles, known as struggle sessions. They were beaten, humiliated, and forced to wear towering caps, and placards listing their supposed crimes, like capitalist sympathizer or enemy of the revolution. (emotional soft music) Across China, the pursuit of knowledge was replaced by fear and political conflict. By 1968, 131 of the 171 senior members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing faced persecution. And many others lost their lives. - Chen was one of the targets. (shove rattling) He was forced into manual labor, (fire crackling) and made to live in a converted boiler room with no electricity. (shove rattling) The Red Guard insulted him, spat on him, and beat him so badly that Chen often lost consciousness. - In one report, it was so bad that he may have tried to commit suicide. He jumped off of a third story building and, fortunately, didn't hit the ground. He landed on the second floor, and got injured, but didn't die. - [Derek] Despite all of this, (tense music playing) Chen kept secretly working on his math under the dim light of a kerosene lamp. Then on the 13th of September, (plane whirring) 1971, Mao's right-hand man died (camera clicking) in a mysterious plane crash. (camera clicking) After supposedly trying organize a coup. His death shattered the illusion of unity in the Party, (clicker clicking) and the cultural revolution began to lose steam. (clicker clicking) (bright dramatic music) - But Chen faced a dilemma. On the one hand, he wanted to publish his proof, but on the other he was terrified of being criticized, Unsure what to do, he turned to Luo Shengxiong, the head of the mathematical institute, who told him, \"The result is sound. You must publish.\" (dramatic music continuing) - [Derek] And so in April, 1973, Chen published his theorem. Three years later, Mao Zedong died and the Cultural Revolution ended. Famous journalist, Xu Chi took note of Chen's story, and wrote an article about his achievements and hardship. (uplifting music) The article was reprinted in China's most popular newspaper, and read by millions. The State that, just 10 years earlier, silenced Chen now celebrated him as a national hero. His story was retold in schools, books, and films. He even got an asteroid named after him in 1996. - And imagine if he hadn't done it, you know, if he hadn't published it. Like all his work, his whole mission, his whole ideals, his whole vision, maybe no one would've known about it. It would've just been a little line somewhere, like, \"Oh, I've got this proof, but, yeah, I'm not gonna show it to you.\" You know? But so often we like shoot ourselves down, whereas really do your best and then put it out into the world, and then let the world, sort of, like evaluate it. And while Chen got incredibly close, he was never able to fulfill his ultimate dream, to solve the strong Goldbach conjecture. (dramatic music playing) Perhaps one reason why it's so hard to prove true is because maybe it's not. Maybe it's false. But if it is false, then there's a very easy way to show that, by finding a counter example. A single even number that can't be written as the sum of two primes. - If Goldbach is false, it would be very easy for you to convince me that Goldbach is false. - Just find a counter example. - That is the only way that you can convince me that Goldbach is false. If Goldbach is false, then it's false because there's a counter example. And if there's a counter example, then you can give me the counter example, and I can check for myself, then, yes, that's a counter example. - [Casper] In this pursuit, in 1938, a mathematician, named Nils Pipping, checked all numbers up to a hundred thousand, by hand, but he didn't find a single counterexample. Since then, modern computers have brought this number up to four quintillion, and the conjecture holds for every single one of them. - [Derek] In fact, we can also use computers to check in just how many ways a different number can be written as the sum of two primes, (bright music) which gives us this pattern. It looks like a curve with tails, it strongly resembles a comet, which is why this is known as Goldbach's comet. It shows that as the number gets larger, there are more and more ways to write every even number as the sum of two primes. And if we overlay our heuristic argument from before, we find that it matches up remarkably well. - The one way the conjecture could be false is if, for whatever reason, at some very large number, there's a conspiracy where this completely breaks down, and it suddenly drops below that line. Are there any examples where you suddenly have a big drop in the number of ways you can compose a number? - No, no, those asymptotics seem to hold very nicely. There are no big drops. - [Derek] So it seems like the conjecture should be true. - We've tested, by brute force, all the numbers up to four quintillion, and they all obey Goldbach's conjecture. So you might think that we should have found a counterexample by now, or, at least, a number that doesn't follow this general trend we've seen. But, on the scale of all numbers, four quintillion is nothing. So we'll have to come up with some smart approach, or fundamentally new way, of solving this problem. Now, as far as we know, solving Goldbach's conjecture doesn't really affect any other areas of math. And it also doesn't seem to have any direct applications to the real world. So you might think, why bother solving this problem? Why not work on some big problem that we know is important? But I think that misses the point. (gentle inquisitive music) - What if the Goldbach conjectures turns out it is opening up a whole new part of the multiverse of mathematical ideas. We don't really know 'cause we don't have the bird's eye view, or the God's eye view, of math. It's what it looks like to us right now on the web of math. So, I tend to dislike this picture of certain things are central (inquisitive music continuing) and other things are peripheral. People should do what fires them up. Because if you do that, you'll be passionate, you'll think about it all the time. You'll do it when you're in the shower. You'll think about it when you're driving. And you might do something remarkable because of that passion. And if you're just doing something 'cause you think it's important, I think you'll tend to be second rate, honestly. (laughing) I like the modest view that we don't know what's necessarily important, but we do know what we love. So work on that. (electronics whirring) (inquisitive music continuing) - Goldbach's conjecture frustrated mathematicians for centuries. And, for a long time, (wind whooshing) it seemed like an unsolvable problem. Many gave up, thinking it was just too big to tackle. But as we've seen, it only takes a few incredibly determined individuals who reject the status quo to keep pushing towards a solution. And it's not just big math problems. Life is full of inconveniences (bright happy music) that some of us just start to accept as unsolvable. For me, shaving was one of these things. The irritation, the razor burn, the cost of constantly replacing razors. It felt like something I just kinda had to put up with. But then I started using (choir vocalizing) the Henson Razor, and I can honestly say it was a game changer. (upbeat joyful music) I've been using it ever since we first started working together two years ago, and now I don't go anywhere without it. And it's not just me. (clicker clicking) Many of you have shared your experiences too. The experts from Henson come from the aerospace world and they applied the same obsessive focus to create a better shaving experience. Their razor is made using CNC machines, which are capable of achieving incredibly tight tolerances. The razor blades stick out just 0.03 millimeters. That means that the blade is perfectly supported, so it maintains its precise 30 degree cutting angle, and it reduces chaffer, the tiny up and down vibrations that can cause skin irritation. If you want a better shaving experience, engineered by experts, head over to hensonshaving.com/veritasium. Use my code \"veritasium\" for a hundred free blades with the purchase of any razor. Make sure to add both the razor and the blades to your cart for the code to take effect. And try the Henson Razor for yourself.

numbers, perhaps just two prime numbers would be enough to sum to give you every even number.\" In fact, as Euler wrote in his letter, this is how Goldbach originally framed the problem in person.", "So, Euler reformulated Goldbach's idea (wind whooshing) into two separate conjectures.", "(wind whooshing) The first dealt with odd numbers, and said, \"Every odd number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" This became known as the weak Goldbach conjecture.", "And the second (wind whooshing) dealt with even numbers.", "It said, \"Every even number greater than 2 can be

as the sum of two primes, and the further down you go, the more combinations you find.", "- So, mathematicians started asking a new question, not just whether every even number can be written as the sum of two primes, but in how many different ways it can be done.", "- [Derek] Let's call that number H of N.", "For example, H of 4 is 1, because you can only write 4 as the sum of primes 2 plus 2.",

prime.", "So here's a crude version of what Hardy and Littlewood did.", "They imagined this large even number, and they said it equal to 2N.", "So you could split it right down the middle at N.", "Now they considered a pair of numbers, A and B, that together add up to 2N.", "Where A is smaller than N, and B is larger.", "They both must differ from N by the same amount.", "Let's call it C.", "Now, according to the prime number theorem, the chance that A is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N - C.", "And the chance that B is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N plus C.", "But here's the trick.", "- Most of the times we're talking about Ns that are ginormous, that are super, super large.", "And if you look at 1 over L and N, that function would be something like this.", "Where,

chance that both are prime?", "- [Derek] You're gonna multiply 'em together, - We're gonna multiply them together - [Derek] Still, so far we've just looked at one pair, while, in total, there are about N possible pairs, N ways to add up two numbers to get to 2N.", "So we can just multiply the chance of one pair being prime with the total number of pairs, to find the total expected number of prime pairs, which comes out to about N over ln N squared.", "And if we plot this, we find that the expected number of ways to write any number as the sum of two primes increases for larger and larger numbers.", "- Hardy and Littlewood, they refined this a bit more, but essentially what they find, you know, is the exact same thing.", "They just have like a correction factor in front, but then this term is still the same.", "- [Derek] The only problem is that this is just an estimate, not a proof.", "And as they point out in their own conclusion, \"It is only proof that counts.\" - And that's about as far as they get for the strong Goldbach conjecture.", "But on the weak one, they have more success.", "(inquisitive pulsing music) - [Derek] It all comes back to a curious incident 10 years

arrives.", "(inquisitive music continuing) It's sent by a completely unknown mathematician from India, (camera clicking) Srinivasa Ramanujan.", "The letter reads, \"I'm now about 23 years of age.", "I have no university education, but I have undergone the ordinary school course.", "After leaving school, I've been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at mathematics.\" Ramanujan writes that he's a poor clerk, earning only about 20 pounds a year.", "He's attached some formulas and is asking for Hardy's opinion.", "The letter is over 10 pages long and is packed with over 100 theorems,

with them.", "- [Elmer] So Hardy writes back.", "The rigorous and strict mathematician he is, he asks for proof.", "(birds tweeting) Ramanujan, however, is nothing like Hardy.", "He works on intuition, often guided by dreams.", "- He would just see the result, or in some mystical versions of his own telling, he would say that his personal goddess, Namagiri, would come to him in his dreams, and write the formulas on his tongue.", "- Wait on his tongue?", "- On his tongue is the version I've sometimes heard.", "But in any case, she planted it in his mind.", "- [Elmer] \"An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.\" Ramanujan never really learned how to provide proof to his theorems.", "So Hardy urges him to come to Cambridge to explain them in more detail.", "But there's a problem.", "(bird tweeting) Ramanujan is a devout Hindu.", "His faith forbids him from crossing the sea.", "Then one night his mother has a dream, (harp trilling) a goddess appears, and tells her to let Ramanujan fulfill his destiny.", "Convinced by the vision she gives her blessing.", "(camera clicking) And so, Ramanujan finally sets out for England.", "(inspiring music playing) In Cambridge, Hardy and Ramanujan start working together.", "- I mean, I'm gonna get choked up thinking about it.", "It's such a beautiful sentiment.", "Trying to remember how Hardy put it.", "It's something like he thought, (gentle music continuing) you know, on a scale from 0 to 100, you know, maybe he's a 10.", "Littlewood is a 30.", "Like Ramanujan is an 80, some kind of crazy thing like that.", "So he knew that Ramanujan was special.", "Hmm, didn't expect to get emotional for you, but this is what I do when I think about Ramanujan.", "(Professor Strogatz laughing) - [Elmer] But his new life in England is harsh.", "He's not used to the climate, (emotional string music) he's not used to the food, and war is ravaging.", "It will become one of the darkest chapters of his life.", "If you wanna know more about Ramanujan's struggles, and what made him such a genius, there's an upcoming video on our channel, Fern.", "- [Derek] While Ramanujan struggled, Hardy and he did make a breakthrough.", "(hopeful classical music playing) Around 1917, they invented what's known as the circle method, and used it to tackle different problems in number theory.", "Hardy and Littlewood later developed this idea further, and for the next a hundred years, this would be the main method to tackle the weak Goldbach conjecture.", "- But let's remind ourselves of the problem.", "We're trying to prove that we can always write an odd number, large odd number, as the sum of three primes.", "Call it P1, P2, and P3.", "(gentle inquisitive music) - But just like before, we don't only want to know whether it's possible, but in how many different ways it can be done.", "So, Hardy and Littlewood imagined a counting machine of sorts.", "As input, it would take all possible combinations of three prime numbers smaller than N.", "(machine ticking) For each combination it would add them up and check if that sum is equal to N.", "And, if it is, the machine increments a counter by 1.", "(bell dinging) But if not, the machine does nothing.", "(bell dinging) It goes on (machine whirring) to the next combination.", "(machine whirring) Let's do an example.", "(machine whirring) Say N is 11.", "Well, the machine first checks the primes 2, 2, and 2, adds them up to get 6, (machine whirring) which is not equal to 11.", "So the counter stays at 0.", "(bell dinging) Next it tries 2, 2, 3, which is 7.", "So again, it does nothing.", "(bell dinging) And it keeps cycling through until it hits 2, 2, 7, (bell dinging) which is equal to 11.", "(machine whirring) So now the machine increments the counter (bell dinging) by 1.", "As it keeps running through primes, the counter increments only one more time for 3, 3, 5.", "(bell dinging) (machine whirring) So in total, there are two ways to write 11 (bell dinging) as the sum of three primes.", "But how would you go about building this machine out of mathematics?", "(pen scratching) Because that is exactly what Hardy and Littlewood did.", "Their technique is so ingenious, I want to take you through it step by step.", "It starts with the function E to the I theta.", "This function just traces out a unit circle in the complex plane.", "The angle theta determines how far around the circle you are.", "Now imagine that theta is restricted to be some multiple M of 2 pi.", "And since 2 pi is one complete revolution, it doesn't matter if M is 0, 1, 2, 3, or any integer, a vector from the origin would always point in the same direction, to the right.", "But now Hardy and Littlewood multiply the angle by alpha, where alpha is just some number between 0 and 1.", "You can think of it as a slider.", "So if M equals 1, and you increase alpha from 0, well, the vector slowly makes one full rotation.", "If M equals 2, the vector will move around faster and make two full rotations.", "And this keeps going for higher values of M.", "Now imagine taking all possible values of alpha simultaneously, and then averaging out all of those vectors.", "Mathematically, we can write this as the integral from 0, to 1 of E of the I 2 pi alpha, D alpha.", "So what happens?", "Well, this vector cancels with this one on the opposite side, and this one with that one.", "And the same thing happens with all the vectors.", "So, averaging them, we get 0.", "The same thing happens if M equals 2, or 3, or 4.", "This integral will give 0 for all values of M.", "Except a single case.", "If M equals 0, then we have E to the 0 which equals 1.", "So no matter what alpha is, the vector always points to the right, and averaging that will always give 1.", "So this equation is very close to the machine we were trying to create.", "If M equals 0, it returns 1, (bell dinging) but if M is not equal to 0, it returns 0.", "(bell dinging) So all that's left to do is replace M with what we're interested in.", "Specifically, is the sum of P1 plus P2 plus P3 equal to N?", "We can rearrange that to get P1 plus P2 plus P3 minus equals 0.", "So, if we sub in this expression for M, then every time the three primes add up to N, this value will be 0, and the integral (bell dinging) will be equal to one.", "And every time the primes don't add up to N, this value will be non-zero.", "And so the integral will return 0.", "(bell dinging) But, right now, this equation only checks one triplet of primes.", "To check all possible combinations of primes smaller than N, we need to add a sum.", "Since this will count up all the ways three primes can add to make N, we can call it H of N.", "So in fact, let's try it out.", "Put in N equals 11, compute this function, and it gives 6.", "(wind whooshing) (paper rustling) Which is not the 2 we found before.", "So what happened?", "Well, we've simplified the logic a little bit, so we actually get some duplicates this time.", "For example, the machine finds 2, 2, 7, but also 7, 2, 2, and 2, 7, 2.", "Mathematicians correct for this when doing the real calculation, but for our purposes, this machine is good enough.", "So we've got our H of N, and if we can show that H of N is at least 1 for every odd number greater than 5, then we've proven the weak Goldbach conjecture.", "But there are two issues with this approach.", "The first is that we assumed that we know all of the prime numbers smaller than N, which is true when N is small.", "But as N goes to infinity, we just don't know all of the primes.", "The second problem is that, as the number of primes increases, the number of possible combinations explodes.", "If N is 10,001, there are 1,229 smaller prime numbers, which means a total of 310 million, 144 thousand, 296 possible prime triplets.", "Increase N to a billion, and the possible combinations jumps up to nearly 22 sextillion.", "(soft piano music playing) And this trend continues.", "So, using this approach in a simple way won't work.", "So Hardy and Littlewood came up with a smarter way.", "They fundamentally reframed the problem by taking the sum inside the integral.", "Rather than checking all possible combinations of prime numbers by brute force, they now analyze the collective behavior of all the primes at once.", "To see how this works, take a look at the equation.", "In the exponent is the sum of three primes minus N, but adding in the exponent is the same as multiplying exponentials together.", "So we can rewrite this as the product of four exponentials.", "The first three of these are actually identical because there's nothing to distinguish what we call P1, P2, P3.", "They're all prime numbers drawn from the same set.", "So we could just call this function S of alpha and N, and we could multiply it by itself three times, or just cube it.", "By doing this, H of N is now a function of just two things, E to the minus I two pi N alpha, which is just a complex number that you could compute, and this new function, S of alpha and N.", "But what is this function?", "Well, let's do an example.", "Again, say N equals 11.", "Then S of alpha and 11 equals just a sum of four exponentials, each governed by its own prime number.", "You can think of each of these exponentials as a clock, each with its own prime number that determines how fast the clock spins.", "So 2 turns the slowest, 3 turns faster, 5 turns faster still, and so on.", "But remember, this is a sum.", "So we actually need to add up all the clocks tip to tail.", "Now watch what happens as we increase alpha.", "All the clocks wind around at their own rates.", "What we're interested in is not the behavior of any individual clock, but instead all of them together.", "Since we've chosen a pretty small value for N, nothing too exciting happens, but watch what happens if we pick a larger value for N, like 99.", "Now there are 25 prime numbers that are smaller than 99, and hence 25 clocks in our sum.", "Now as we increase alpha, all the clocks, again, wind around at their different rates.", "It almost looks like a dragon's tail.", "And for a while everything seems kind of chaotic, circling around the origin, but then, when alpha hits 1 over 6, the tail unwinds, and suddenly almost all the clocks point in a similar direction, and we get a large resultant value.", "If we increase alpha further, the clocks cancel out again until we hit the next magic point, 1 over 3.", "Here again, many clocks line up.", "And this curious pattern keeps repeating.", "For the majority of values of alpha, the clocks cancel each other out.", "But at a few special points, like a half, the tail unwinds, the clocks interfere constructively, and we get a large resultant value.", "- If the angle is, you know, 360 degrees divided by a whole number, you get some very particular behavior that's very predictable.", "Those are the angles at which this function, when you sum the primes, they actually go far from from 0.", "And what happens at a random angle, and you just start adding the primes up, it keeps changing which way it's pointing, and the thing just bounces around.", "- So why is this happening?", "Well, let's look at when alpha equals a half.", "Here what we're doing is multiplying each prime number in the exponent by a half.", "In other words, dividing each prime number by 2.", "So let's do this for each of the primes.", "In the first column, we'll write down how many times it can be divided by 2.", "And in the second column we'll write down the remainder.", "So 2 divided by 2 equals 1, leaving a remainder of 0.", "So we've just made one full rotation.", "3 divided by two is 1, but that leaves a remainder of 1, so it makes one full rotation and then a half rotation.", "5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.", "So it makes two full rotations and then a half rotation more.", "Now, we don't really care about the first column because it doesn't matter how many full rotations a clock makes, we only care about where the arrow ends up.", "And that's fully determined by the remainder.", "It's just the remainder times alpha.", "So from now on we'll just keep track of the remainders.", "And what we find is that all of the other remainders are equal to 1.", "So all clocks, except the first one, point the same way.", "This is because when we're dividing whole numbers by 2, there are only two possible remainders, 0 or 1.", "And since we're working with prime numbers, only 2 can have the remainder 0, because no other prime number is even, therefore, all other primes must share the remainder 1.", "(wind whooshing) Meaning all those clocks end up making another half rotation, so they all point left and constructively interfere.", "(wind whooshing) A similar thing happens when alpha equals a third.", "Now each prime is divided by 3.", "So the possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2.", "Again, 3 is the only clock that has remainder 0, so that points right.", "But all the other primes follow a special pattern, a pattern that makes the entire circle method possible.", "The remaining primes distribute themselves roughly equally between remainders 1 and 2, which means all the remaining clocks are rotated one third or two thirds of the way around the circle.", "Since these clocks are pointing to the left, again, we get constructive interference.", "And this pattern of constructive interference also occurs for other small rational fractions.", "But for non-rational numbers, you don't get these nicely restricted remainders.", "So the clocks are roughly distributed equally all over the circle, and you get destructive interference.", "(upbeat tense music playing) Hardy and Littlewood realized they could use this.", "Imagine taking this plot of the magnitude of the resultant arrow and wrapping it around a circle.", "What they found is that the majority of the contributions come from very small regions of the circle, what they called the major arcs.", "The rest of the circle only adds minor contributions.", "So they called these the minor arcs.", "This allowed them to split up their calculation into two parts.", "The major arc part gives you the main term for how many ways you can write a number N as the sum of three primes.", "And the minor arcs just gives you an error term.", "(upbeat classical music playing) They then showed that, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then the main term grows faster than the error term.", "So eventually, for some large enough number, call it K, this value will always be larger than 1, and the weak Goldbach conjecture holds.", "But there are two problems with this approach.", "The first is that they assumed that a generalization of the Riemann's hypothesis is true, which we don't know.", "And the second is that they didn't actually specify that number, K.", "I mean, how big of a number do you need to get to before you can guarantee that all numbers larger than that adhere to Goldbach conjecture?", "- Then we've got to wait until 1937 when Russian mathematician, Ivan Vinogradov, proves the same as Hardy and Littlewood.", "But he did it without the generalized Riemann hypothesis.", "So, you know, assumption free.", "- It's one thing to just assume the Riemann hypothesis, and say, \"Oh yeah, you can make some progress.\" But Vinogradov's like, \"No guys, you don't need the Riemann hypothesis.", "You can really prove this stuff.\" - But again, he gives some

1973, Chen published his theorem.", "Three years later, Mao Zedong died and the Cultural Revolution ended.", "Famous journalist, Xu Chi took note of Chen's story, and wrote an article about his achievements and hardship.", "(uplifting music) The article was reprinted in China's most popular newspaper, and read by millions.", "The State that, just 10 years earlier, silenced Chen now

thousand, by hand, but he didn't find a single counterexample.", "Since then, modern computers have brought this number up to four quintillion, and the conjecture holds for every single one of them.",

curve with tails, it strongly resembles a comet, which is why this is known as Goldbach's comet.", "It shows that as the number gets larger, there are more and more ways to write every even number as the sum of two primes.", "And if we overlay our heuristic argument from before, we find that it matches up remarkably well.", "- The one way the conjecture could be false is if, for whatever reason, at some very large number, there's a conspiracy where this completely breaks down, and it suddenly drops below that line.", "Are there any examples where you suddenly have a big drop in the number of ways you can compose a number?", "- No, no, those asymptotics seem to hold very nicely.", "There are no big drops.", "- [Derek] So it seems like the conjecture should be true.", "- We've tested, by brute force, all the numbers up to four quintillion, and they all obey Goldbach's conjecture.", "So you might think that we should have found a counterexample by now, or, at least, a number that doesn't follow this general trend we've seen.", "But, on the scale of all numbers, four quintillion is nothing.", "So we'll have to come up with some smart approach, or fundamentally new way, of solving this problem.", "Now, as far as we know, solving Goldbach's conjecture doesn't really affect any other areas of math.", "And it also doesn't seem to have any direct applications to the real

"language": "en", "content": "- In 1928, a young man shuffled onto a stage in Germany to present a lecture on his recent work. He had a slightly unusual presentation style. Physicist Eugene Wigner described the lecture as detached, almost like a recitation of a technical text. He said, \"The man spoke without giving any sign of enjoying his own lecture.\" But the work this strange unassuming man presented was about to send some of the most famous quantum physicists of the 20th century spiraling. (suspenseful music) After the lecture, Werner Heisenberg described the man's theory as, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" Heisenberg also wrote to Niels Bohr and said, \"I find the present situation quite absurd and, on that account, almost out of despair, I have taken up another field.\" Legend has it that Wolfgang Pauli even announced that he was abandoning quantum physics, and then he started writing a utopian novel. What had the young man said to disrupt the world of quantum mechanics so profoundly? But he had been working on a problem that physicists are still tackling today. The unification of Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics, and his work had revealed something troubling, a particle unlike any scene in the world, a particle with negative energy. (suspenseful music) In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity. It was based on the simple idea that for anyone moving with constant speed, the laws of physics should be the same, and this includes any measurement of the speed of light. So, it doesn't matter how you're moving relative to a beam of light, you should measure its speed to be 300 million meters per second. This means that things that we ordinarily think of as fixed, like time and space, have to transform, so that the speed of light is always measured to have the same value. In making this discovery, Einstein realized that space and time are not really separate dimensions at all. They're linked in a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. (pensive music) When Einstein applied this idea to an object emitting light, he found something peculiar. When an object loses energy by emitting photons, its mass must also decrease, and the change in the object's mass is equal to the energy of the photons emitted divided by the speed of light squared. In other words, he found that energy must be equal to mc squared. E equals mc squared. - [Einstein] Mass and energy are but different manifestations of the same thing. - So, a particle's total energy comes from its momentum and its rest mass, giving it new relationship between energy and momentum. (pensive music) Now, if we take the square root of both sides, we get an expression for the energy of a particle in terms of its mass and momentum. And if we plot energy versus momentum in a single dimension, we get this curve, where mc squared, the rest mass energy of the object, is the lowest possible value for energy. But really, when we took the square root, we should have put a plus/minus out front, which would give us two curves: one for positive energies and another for negative energies. But we don't observe things that have energy less than 0. I mean, what would that even mean? So, in classical physics, the solution is simple. You just ignore the negative energy solutions. They can't physically represent anything, right, Casper? - Well, sure, that sounds right. But around the same time that Einstein was coming up with his special theory of relativity, physicists began observing some strange phenomena in atomic physics that were overthrowing all of these classical assumptions. First of all, they noticed that when looking at the energy levels of subatomic particles, like electrons, they weren't continuous at all, they were discrete. And they also didn't just behave as particles, but as waves. So, if you would take electrons and fire them through two narrow slits, then they would create interference patterns, just like light does. What they were discovering was the new field of quantum mechanics. (suspenseful music) And in 1926, Erwin Schrodinger formalized this field by coming up with his now-famous wave equation, which describes how quantum mechanical systems evolve over time. - This was the most radical new theory of the 20th century, and would remain so. This is not a bit like Newton or a bit like Maxwell. This was radically new. - [Casper] The equation solution, called the wave function, psi, does not describe a particle with a precise position and momentum as classical laws would. But instead, the modular squared can give us the probability of finding the particle in a specific location at a specific time. - Deriving the Schrodinger equation is actually surprisingly simple. Just start by writing down the total energy, which, for a free particle, is just its kinetic energy, 1/2 mv squared. And we can rewrite it in terms of momentum, mass times velocity. So kinetic energy is just momentum squared divided by 2m. Now, we're going to make this quantum, and to do that, we need two things. The first is the wave function, psi, which describes how particles act as waves at quantum scales. And the second is something called a quantum operator. This is just a mathematical tool that extracts information from the wave function to reveal a specific property of the particle, like its position, energy, or momentum. The operators for energy and momentum look like this. By inputting these operators, we can make each side of the equation act on the wave function, and that gives us the Schrodinger equation for a free particle. (pensive music) For particles that aren't free, like electrons in atoms, you need to factor in potential energy, too, which gives you the full Schrodinger equation. (pensive music) - But there are some places where it doesn't produce the right prediction. For example, take the element gold. The Schrodinger equation suggests that it should be a silver gray color, just like all the other metals. But it's not, I mean, it's gold. And for mercury, the Schrodinger equation predicts that it should be a solid at room temperature, but it's a liquid. So, what is wrong? Well, I'll give you a hint, because both gold and mercury are heavy elements. - [Derek] They have a high number of protons in their nuclei, which attract orbiting electrons more strongly. So, if you're thinking in a classical sense, the electrons would be bound tighter in, and they'd be whizzing around at higher speeds than in other elements. And for electrons in some orbits, those speeds start to get a little too close to the speed of light. (pensive music) So, let's go back to the Schrodinger equation. There, we had the kinetic energy was p squared over 2m. But for particles moving at relativistic speeds close to the speed of light, that equation isn't the right one. The correct equation is the energy momentum relation from special relativity. - Schrodinger's equation is not consistent with the theory of relativity, so it's... Technically, it's not right. (pensive music) - So, the solution seems simple enough. Just start with the relativistic energy momentum relation and use that to derive a new wave equation. (pensive music) Well, this is exactly what a physicist named Oskar Klein did in 1926. He subbed in the same energy and momentum operators that Schrodinger used, and found this equation. (pensive music) Klein's work was pretty well-received by a number of his colleagues. In fact, it turned out the two other physicists, Walter Gordon and Vladimir Fock, had independently arrived at the same equation in that same year. It became known as the Klein-Gordon equation, which was a bit of a burn for Fock. (graphic whooshing) (graphic twinkling) But that's often how it goes. You do all the hard work and then no one notices. Things have changed a little since Fock's time, but the key to recognition is still visibility. And these days, that means having a website.

I wanna thank Hostinger for sponsoring this part of the video. And now, back to Klein, Gordon, and Fock. The Klein-Gordon-Fock equation even made its way over to one of the fathers of quantum physics, Niels Bohr, who must have been impressed, because at the 1927 Solvay Conference, Bohr was chatting to a promising young physicist about what he was working on. The young man said, \"I'm trying to get a relativistic theory of the electron.\" Bohr replied, \"But Klein has already solved this problem.\" The young man disagreed. So, who was this bold 25-year-old? He was Paul Dirac, a man who Bohr would later give the nickname The Strangest Man because he was truly one of a kind. - First time I went to Princeton, I met a couple who invited Dirac and his wife. And Dirac, for the whole meal, which lasted three hours, didn't say a single word. Not one word. He wasn't sulky, he wasn't angry. He just saw no reason to speak. - That's crazy. - [Derek] Dirac was a man of so few words that his colleagues invented a special unit, a Dirac, equivalent to speaking one word per hour. Legend also has it that he liked to relax by climbing trees in three-piece suits. And that wasn't his only strange hobby. As a student, Dirac had attended seminars on Einstein's theory of relativity, and he'd kind of fallen in love with it. He was impressed by the elegance and beauty of its mathematics. To Dirac, this got to the core of what a good theory must do. He once said, \"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.\" (pensive music) - [Casper] Do you know why Dirac was so drawn to relativity? - Einstein went in there and did it all... Not all, but almost all by deductive reasoning. That made a huge impression on Dirac, right? He realized that it was advanced mathematics was really important to understanding the way that nature works. - So, Dirac found a new hobby, obsessively updating classical equations with Einstein's theory of relativity, so that they would now work for relative physics scenarios as well that are those approaching the speed of light. He later said this was like a game for him, and so it's maybe not too much of a surprise then that he was one of the people trying to unite quantum physics and relativity because a theory that would cover both of these would be truly beautiful in his eyes. - Dirac didn't see the beauty in Klein, Gordon, and Fock's relativistic update of the Schrodinger equation, and he wasn't alone. Fellow physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, after reading Klein's paper, wrote him a letter, wishing his physics a speedy recovery. Pauli was known for being pretty savage. And actually, the Klein-Gordon equation is useful in some cases, but he and Dirac were both concerned with one particular feature of the equation. - And that's because the Klein-Gordon equation contains this term. That's a second-order time derivative. So the wave function is being differentiated twice with respect to time. Now, remember, the Schrodinger equation also contains a second-order derivative, but that's with space, not with time. Time is just first-order. So, why is this such a problem? Well, think of a very simple second-order time derivative. Something like d squared y over dt squared is equal to 3. Now, to figure out what y is, the function that satisfies this equation, we just have to integrate it twice. (pensive music) (record scratching) But notice, to find the solution, we now two integration constants, c and D. And the problem is that we can only find that if we know both y at a given time and if we know the first derivative of y at a given time. This makes sense physically, if you think about, say, throwing a ball in the air. If you want to predict the ball's future motion, well, then, you need to know where you threw it from, that's its position, and how hard you threw it, that's its velocity. Or in other words, you need to know both the position and the first derivative of the position. (suspenseful music) - Similarly, to predict a quantum systems future state using the Klein-Gordon equation, you'd need the initial wave function and the initial first derivative of the wave function. (suspenseful music) Now, the beauty of the Schrodinger equation was that if you knew only the wave function of a system at a given time, you could use it to determine all the future states of that system. But in the Klein-Gordon equation, the wave function no longer told the whole story. And this introduced a further problem. The probability of finding a particle in a given area could no longer be simply described by the modulus of the wave function, as it was for the Schrodinger equation. For the Klein-Gordon equation, a new equation was needed to describe the probability using the wave function, which takes a while to derive, so we won't get into that here, but it looks like this. And the problem with that equation is that unlike the simple modulus of the wave function, it can have negative solutions, negative probabilities. How can the chance of something happening be less than zero? As Dirac put it, that, of course, is physically nonsense. (suspenseful music) So, Dirac did what Dirac does best, and he set out to find his own solution that contained no second-order time derivatives. First, he rewrote the relativistic energy momentum relationship like this, which is a linear equation. So no squaring E, that is no squaring the energy operator, which is what gave rise to that second-order time derivative in the Klein-Gordon equation. Now, he just had to solve this equation and find the coefficients, alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta, and he would have a solution. (pensive music) To do this, we can start by squaring both sides of the equation. Next, we can expand the momentum on the left-hand side into its three dimensions, and then expand the right-hand side to end up with this long equation. It might look pretty complicated, but there is a trick we can use. (pensive music) And notice that all these terms on the right-hand side are multiplied by pmc cubed, but on the left-hand side, there are no terms containing pmc cubed. So that tells us that when you multiply these coefficients together, like the alpha times beta and beta times alphas, all of that must be 0. And similarly, notice that these terms are multiplied by two different momenta, like px and py times c squared, which also don't have a counterpart on the left-hand side. So these alpha times alpha terms must also be equal to 0. And that just leaves this top row. These terms do match on both sides, which tells us that alpha x squared must be equal to 1, and so must alpha y squared, alpha z squared, and beta squared. So Dirac now had a set of simultaneous equations for alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta that he just needed to solve. That sounds easy, right? But it's not that straightforward. - To see why, let's do some examples. So say alpha x is 1 and beta equals minus 1. Well, then, we get 1 squared, which is 1, equals minus 1 squared, which is also 1, so that satisfies the top equation. But if we fill it in here, we get 1 times minus 1, which is just minus 1, plus minus 1 times 1, which is, again, minus 1, for a total of minus 2. So, that doesn't work. So, let's try another number. Say alpha x is 1, and now it's alpha z that is minus 1. Well, in that case, we get 1 times minus 1. So, again, we get minus 1, plus minus, 1 times 1, again, minus 1. So we, again, get minus 2. And in fact, if you look at this top equation, the only numbers that satisfy this relation is 1 and minus 1. So all these coefficients have to be either 1 or minus 1, but if you fill that in, then the only two possible answers you're gonna get in these equations is minus 2 or positive 2. Now, the two equations that are giving problems are these two, and that's because alpha times beta is the same as beta times alpha. So, you're always gonna get minus 2 or 2. So, the only way to get out of this is to somehow make the order of multiplication matter. But where do you find something like that? (pensive music) - Let's think about a really simple vector, say 1 in the x-direction and 2 in the y-direction. If I reflect this vector along the line y equals x and then reflect it about the x-axis, I get this. But if I start again and instead reflect it first about the x-axis and then along y equals x, I get this, which is totally different. So, the order matters. How do we express this mathematically? We need some way to represent transformations, like reflections as a single coefficient, which means we need matrices. Matrices are arrays of numbers which encapsulate these transformations, telling us how to reflect, rotate, stretch, or squish across each dimension. Mathematically, the order we multiply them matters. Since we multiply the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second, (pensive music) (graphic whooshing) A matrix that reflects along y equals x looks like this and a matrix that reflects about the x-axis looks like this. (pensive music) And if I apply them to that original vector one by one, you can see how we end up with different results. (pensive music) And actually, using matrices in quantum mechanics was not completely out there. Dirac had already seen it done by Werner Heisenberg, his new, if unlikely, friend. Dirac and Heisenberg were very different characters. Heisenberg was charming and outgoing, Dirac hated socializing and small talk. Once the two were on a cruise ship to a conference together and Heisenberg spent a lot of time dancing with women on board. So, Dirac asked him, \"Why do you dance?\" Heisenberg replied, \"When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure.\" Dirac thought about this for a bit before saying, \"How do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?\" So, they were pretty different guys, but Heisenberg had a profound impact on Dirac. (upbeat music) - Do you know what drew him to quantum mechanics initially? - He always said that Heisenberg gave him his start, he always said that. In later life, he used to begin lectures when he was 70, even 80 years old, with the following words. - Quantum mechanics was discovered by Heisenberg in 1925. - As a PhD student, Dirac had closely followed Heisenberg's work, and a few years earlier, Heisenberg had founded for certain properties, like position and momentum. The order of multiplication matters. So x times p is not the same as p times x. This was actually the beginning of Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle, which says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of physical properties in quantum systems. It turns out that if the order of multiplication matters for two properties like position and momentum, then that means there's an inherent uncertainty in their combined measurements. The order we measure them in will change the outcome. Heisenberg's mentor, Max Born, suggested that he could represent this mathematically by using matrices, because there, the order of multiplication also matters. (pensive music) This led Heisenberg to a new form of quantum mechanics, which was mathematically equivalent to Schrodinger's equation, but it was based on matrix algebra. - Dirac recognized something similar in his coefficients where the order of multiplication clearly mattered. So, he thought matrices might be the solution. For his coefficients, he tried 2x2 matrices since they're the smallest, simplest matrices that could make the order of multiplication matter. He found that some worked with the equations. In fact, those reflection matrices we tried earlier worked well, but he just couldn't find solutions for all four coefficients that all worked together. - So this is not simple. Dirac is one of the smartest people of the 20th century in physics, right? But it was not easy. You don't have just to twiddle with bits of the Schrodinger equation. You'd have to do something completely radical. His working is in there, and you could see him really struggling. - Then, Dirac had a stroke of genius. He said, \"I suddenly realized that there was no need to stick to quantities, which can be represented by matrices with just two rows and columns. Why not go to four rows and columns?\" (compelling music) With these four 4x4 matrices, Dirac got these solutions to his simultaneous equations, a matrix with 1s on the diagonal is mathematically equivalent to a 1, and a whole array of 0s is the same thing as 0. So, all of the equations were satisfied. Dirac had found coefficients that worked. Now, we can substitute those matrices back into Dirac's linear equation, then rewrite the three momenta and alpha coefficients as vectors. And just as we did with the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations, we can use the energy and momentum operators to make both sides act on the wave function. If we substitute those operators in, we get Dirac's final equation for the relativistic free electron. (compelling music) The young man who spent his life looking for mathematical beauty had found, perhaps, his most beautiful equation of all. - The people were expecting the solution to be horrible, and it turned out to be a thing of beauty, right? It was something you look at and you think, \"That is absolutely amazing.\" It's a pattern that Dirac found deep in nature. Nothing like that has been seen in physics at that time. (suspenseful music) - To see some of that beauty, you only have to compare it to the Schrodinger equation, which you can see right here. Now, the two look very similar, but there is a lot hidden in the Dirac equation. First of all, it's relativistic, so it works at really, really high speeds because it uses Einstein's energy momentum relationship, unlike the Schrodinger equation which breaks down there. But what's even more beautiful is that if you look at this, Dirac's equation isn't just first order in time derivatives, it's also first order in spatial derivatives. Whereas the Schrodinger equation was second order in spatial derivatives. So you might wonder, \"Well, why does that matter?\" Well, because not only does going first order in all derivatives solve the second-order time derivative problem of the Klein-Gordon equation, it now also treats time and space symmetrically. And it becomes really important if you start thinking about relativity, where time and space are not separate dimensions, they're intertwined in a four dimensional spacetime. And while the Schrodinger equation had just a single component wave function, to make the wave function work with these 4x4 matrices, in Dirac's case, you actually need a wave function that has four components. So, it'll look something like this. Psi one, psi two, psi three, and psi four. - The four-component wave function means that the Dirac equation describes four possible states for any quantum system, which reveals something Schrödinger's single wave function didn't. An electron at a given energy level actually has two possible states due to different orientations of its intrinsic angular momentum, spin up and spin down. (pensive music) This spin creates a tiny magnetic field. So these two states are like tiny magnets pointing in opposite directions, and that has an interesting implication. Take hydrogen, which has one proton and one electron. Classically, the electron whizzes around the proton. But if you switch to the perspective of the electron, well, now, it's the proton that's moving. And since it's positively charged, that moving charge creates a magnetic field in the electron's frame of reference. So, now you've got this electron, which has its own mini magnetic field, interacting with a larger magnetic field, and that interaction will be slightly different for a spin up and a spin down electron. And as a result, some energy levels of the electron split into two closely-spaced energy levels. And you can actually see this if you zoom into the emission spectrum for a hydrogen atom. (suspenseful music) Schrödinger's equation didn't predict that splitting since it just had one solution for each energy level. But with Dirac's four-component solution, the top two wave functions now described two different spin states with two slightly different energies. - Dirac admitted himself that he had never set out to capture spin in his equation. - I started out this work without any intention at all of bringing in the spin of the electron. - [Casper] But hold on, because if an electron at a given energy level only has two possible spin states, then why do we have a four-component wave function? Why are there four states and not just two? (compelling music) - [Derek] Well, that's what brings us back to that 1928 lecture at the start, the one that seemed to drive even the most well-established quantum physicists mad. Because that strange man presenting his work was actually Paul Dirac sharing his new equation with the world. It was Dirac's beautiful equation that Heisenberg called, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" (somber music) - To understand why all those physicists were losing their minds, we only have to look at the simple case when a particle is at rest. This term right here describes the momentum. So, when the particle doesn't move, this becomes 0 and it drops out, which gives us this. Next, we can sub in the energy for this quantum operator to get this. So now, we know that beta times mc squared must be equal to the particle's energy. And if we write out beta and multiplied by mc squared, then we find two positive solutions and two negative solutions for the energy. So, negative energy solutions are baked right into the Dirac equation. (pensive music) This idea that a free electron could have negative energy was impossible for any of these physicists to accept. Because think about it. If electrons can have a negative energy, then that means that they could continually radiate positive energy, that is emit photons, and drop into lower and lower negative energy states. There would be no limit to how far they could fall into the negative energy abyss. (compelling music) - It looked like, to many very smart people, and Dirac was smart enough to know they had a point, that this equation, it got the mass and the magnetic moment of the electron. Yes, but on the other hand, it predicts this ridiculous situation, where you have negative energy values. - Right. - That's nonsense. So, Heisenberg said, \"I give up. This is just ridiculous.\" So, Dirac, he had, in some very clear sense, had to rescue his equation. (pensive music) - [Derek] Dirac spent three years sticking to his guns. He tried all sorts of ways to interpret his new equation to explain where the negative energy was coming from. Then, in 1931, he proposed something radical to explain the negative energy solutions. (suspenseful music) A new kind of particle unknown to experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron. We may call such a particle an anti-electron. We should not expect to find any of them in nature on account of their rapid rate of recombination with electrons. (suspenseful music) So, Dirac was proposing that those four states described in his four-component wave function are a spin up electron, a spin down electron, a spin up antielectron, and a spin down antielectron. - When Dirac said that, people didn't start running around saying, \"Where's this antielectron?\" They just ignored it. - Yeah. - Cut to the laboratory at Caltech. - In 1932, a Caltech postdoc named Carl Anderson was working on a project trying to identify the charge particles produced by cosmic rays. He photographed the tracks these particles left in a cloud chamber containing a uniform magnetic field. Anderson noticed several instances of a similar track. It looked a lot like the tracks he'd seen left by electrons. Only, it curved in the opposite direction in the magnetic field. Kind of like the tracks of positively charged protons. But there was no way it could be a proton based on the length of the track. It had traveled farther in air, and therefore it had to be much lighter. It had to be something with around the same mass as an electron, but opposite charge. A positive electron, or as he named it, a positron. He actually also tried to rebrand electrons as negatrons, but that one didn't quite stick. Just one year after Dirac proposed the antielectron, Carl Anderson found it entirely by accident. (uplifting music) - But this alone doesn't get rid of the negative energy problem. Remember what we said earlier. If any particles, like these positrons, can have negative energy, then they could continually radiate energy and drop into lower and lower negative energy states. Fortunately, Dirac proposed a solution to this problem as well, although it was a little crazy. (suspenseful music) - He theorized something called the Dirac sea, describing a vacuum as an infinite sea of electrons occupying all available negative energy states. And since no two electrons can occupy the same state, this prevents observable positive energy electrons from falling into the negative energy states. A hole or vacancy in this sea then becomes a positron. When an electron and a positron meet and annihilate, well, that's just an electron falling back into the sea and filling that hole. The theory is mathematically sound. Of course, it's Dirac we're talking about, but if you feel like it's hard to come to terms with the idea that we're floating on an infinite sea of electrons, well, you wouldn't be alone. - It's not even that crazy if, I don't know, several decades later, people find that exact model in a physical system. In condensed matter physics, you see an exact analogy of also having electrons in the conduction band and say valence-covalence band. - Yes, that's true. That's true. But Dirac really was, you know, out there. You see what I mean? Maybe it was people like... He doesn't see it, really seeing that people are saying, \"This is nonsense.\" But it was a way of Dirac's rectilinear thinking, thinking, \"Well maybe this is...\" And then it drove him to antimatter. - Thankfully, in 1941, a Swiss physicist named Ernst Stueckelberg had a clever idea. The way function contains a term that looks like this, where energy is multiplied by time. So, we can see that if we just change the sign of time when the energy is negative, then we get the same result because a negative multiplied by a negative gives us a positive. Stueckelberg took this, and he suggested that negative energy electrons traveling backwards in time are mathematically equivalent to positive energy antielectrons, that is positrons, traveling forwards in time. - A few years later, around 1948, Richard Feynman took this idea and used it in one of the most powerful tools in modern physics, the Feynman diagrams. In his sketches of particle interactions, he showed antiparticles traveling the opposite way to particles backwards in time. (pensive music) It was a brilliant trick. Negative energy solutions no longer had to mean there was negative energy or a Dirac sea. They simply indicated the presence of an antiparticle. (suspenseful music) We now know that there's a corresponding antiparticle for every subatomic particle, with the same mass, but opposite charge. So, the proton has the antiproton, the neutrino has the antineutrino, and so on. - According to his friend, Heisenberg, that was the biggest leap in 20th-century physics to say there's a whole slew of antiparticles corresponding to particles, and Dirac got that through this crazy model. (pensive music) - But all is not solved. This new antiworld introduces some big questions about the very nature of our universe. Because particles and their antiparticles are equal and opposite, when they come together, they annihilate and produce two photons with energy equivalent to their mass and kinetic energy. And this process is reversible. Two photons with the right energies can produce a matter and antimatter pair. This is called Breit-Wheeler pair production. (suspenseful music) (Big Bang exploding) During the first moments after the Big Bang, the universe was hot, dense, and full of these pairs popping into and out of existence. If an equal number of matter and antimatter particles were created, you would expect them to all annihilate each other in this dense environment, leaving behind only energy. But that didn't happen. We ended up with a universe full of matter. If we work backwards from how much matter and antimatter is in the universe today, it's actually estimated that only one particle per billion of matter needed to survive this hot, dense era and not get annihilated. That tiny difference would give us the makeup of our universe today, where matter dominates. - So what allowed that one particle per billion to escape annihilation? Why did matter win out over antimatter? (compelling music) Well, that's a pretty big question with some not so simple answers. So, we're doing an entire second video where we have some pretty spectacular stuff happening. We're getting into the beast. It's absolutely insane. I feel like I should not be in here. So you're making anti-atoms? - Yes. (energy humming) - [Casper] It's so cool. (compelling music) - Dirac is probably less well-known than people like Heisenberg or Schrödinger, but his contribution to quantum physics was immense, and he was recognized for it. He shared the 1933 Nobel Prize with Schrödinger for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory. And perhaps this gave strange, quiet Dirac some newfound confidence, because that physicist in the audience of his 1928 lecture at the start, Eugene Wigner, actually became a reasonable friend of Dirac's. And in 1934, introduced Dirac to his sister, Margit Wigner, a woman who would change Dirac's life, perhaps more than any equation or Nobel Prize. (pensive music) - They were antiparticles, right? They had completely different personalities. He had almost no empathy, right? And he knew it. She had buckets of it. He hardly talked, she couldn't stop talking. You could just go on, like they are completely different people. But the marriage did work. My great friend Lilia Harris Chandra, who knew them, she came out with a great line, great line, which is, \"He gave her status, she gave him a life.\" - So, I guess there is one particle-antiparticle pair that never annihilated. (pensive music) (graphic beeping) (pensive music) - Hey, one last thing, in case you didn't already know, we just launched the official Veritasium game.

absurd and, on that account, almost out of despair, I have taken up another field.\" Legend has it that Wolfgang Pauli even announced that he was abandoning quantum physics, and then he started writing a utopian novel.", "What had the young man said to disrupt the world of quantum mechanics so profoundly?", "But he had been working on a problem that physicists are still tackling today.",

the same, and this includes any measurement of the speed of light.", "So, it doesn't matter how you're moving relative to a beam of light, you should measure its speed to be 300 million meters per second.", "This means that things that we ordinarily think of as fixed, like time and space, have to transform, so that the speed of light is always measured to have the same value.", "In making this discovery, Einstein realized that space and time are not really separate dimensions at all.", "They're linked in a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime.", "(pensive music) When Einstein applied this idea to an object emitting light, he found something peculiar.", "When an object loses energy by emitting photons, its mass must also decrease, and the change in the object's mass is equal to the energy of the photons emitted divided by the speed of light squared.", "In other words, he found that energy must be equal to mc squared.", "E equals mc squared.", "- [Einstein] Mass and energy are but different manifestations of the same thing.", "- So, a particle's total energy comes from its momentum and its rest mass, giving it new relationship between energy and momentum.", "(pensive music) Now, if we take the square root of both sides, we get an expression for the energy of a particle in terms of its mass and momentum.", "And if we plot energy versus momentum in a single dimension, we get this curve, where mc squared, the rest mass energy of the object, is the lowest possible value for energy.", "But really, when we took the square root, we should have put a plus/minus out front,

in classical physics, the solution is simple.", "You just ignore the negative energy solutions.", "They can't physically represent anything, right, Casper?", "- Well, sure, that sounds right.", "But around the same time that Einstein was coming up with his special theory of relativity, physicists began observing some strange phenomena in atomic physics that were overthrowing all of these classical assumptions.", "First of all, they noticed that when looking at the energy levels of subatomic particles, like electrons, they weren't continuous at all, they were discrete.", "And they also didn't just behave as particles, but as waves.", "So, if you would take electrons and fire them through two narrow slits, then they would create interference patterns, just like light does.", "What they were discovering was the new field of quantum mechanics.", "(suspenseful music) And in 1926, Erwin Schrodinger formalized this field by coming up with his now-famous wave equation, which

"This was radically new.", "- [Casper] The equation solution, called the wave function, psi, does not describe a particle with a precise position and momentum as classical laws would.", "But instead, the modular squared can give us the probability of finding the particle in a specific location at a specific time.", "- Deriving the Schrodinger equation is actually surprisingly simple.", "Just start by writing down the total energy, which, for a free particle, is just its kinetic energy, 1/2 mv squared.", "And we can rewrite it in terms of momentum, mass times velocity.", "So kinetic energy is just momentum squared divided by 2m.", "Now, we're going to make this quantum, and to do that, we need two things.", "The first is the wave function, psi, which describes how particles act as waves at quantum scales.", "And the second is something called a quantum operator.", "This is just a mathematical tool that extracts information from the wave function to reveal a specific property of the particle, like its position, energy, or momentum.", "The operators for energy and momentum look like this.", "By inputting these operators, we can make each side of the equation act on the wave function, and that gives us the Schrodinger equation for a free particle.", "(pensive music) For particles that aren't free, like electrons in atoms, you need to factor in potential energy, too, which gives you the full Schrodinger equation.", "(pensive music) - But there are some places where it doesn't produce the right prediction.", "For example, take the element gold.", "The Schrodinger equation suggests that it should be a silver gray color, just like all the other metals.", "But it's not, I mean, it's gold.", "And for mercury, the Schrodinger equation predicts that it should be a solid at room temperature, but it's a liquid.", "So, what is wrong?", "Well, I'll give you a hint, because both gold and mercury are heavy elements.", "- [Derek] They have a high number of protons in their nuclei, which attract orbiting electrons more strongly.", "So, if you're thinking in a classical sense, the electrons would be bound tighter in, and they'd be whizzing around at higher speeds

"There, we had the kinetic energy was p squared over 2m.", "But for particles moving at relativistic speeds close to the speed of light, that equation isn't the right one.", "The correct equation is the energy momentum relation from special relativity.", "- Schrodinger's equation is not consistent with the theory of relativity, so it's...", "Technically, it's not right.", "(pensive music) - So, the solution seems simple enough.", "Just start with the relativistic energy momentum relation and use that to derive a new wave equation.", "(pensive music) Well, this is exactly what a physicist

at the 1927 Solvay Conference, Bohr was chatting to a promising young physicist about what he was working on.", "The young man said, \"I'm trying to get a relativistic theory of the electron.\" Bohr replied, \"But Klein has already solved this problem.\" The young man disagreed.", "So, who was this bold 25-year-old?", "He was Paul Dirac, a man who Bohr would later give the nickname The Strangest Man because he was truly one of a kind.", "- First time I went to Princeton, I met a couple who invited Dirac and his wife.", "And Dirac, for the whole meal, which lasted three hours, didn't say a single word.", "Not one word.", "He wasn't sulky, he wasn't angry.", "He just saw no reason to speak.", "- That's crazy.", "- [Derek] Dirac was a man of so few words that his colleagues invented a special unit, a Dirac, equivalent to speaking one word per hour.", "Legend also has it that he liked to relax by climbing trees in three-piece suits.", "And that wasn't his only strange hobby.", "As a student, Dirac had attended seminars on Einstein's theory of relativity, and he'd kind of fallen in love with it.", "He was impressed by the elegance and beauty of its mathematics.", "To Dirac, this got to the core of what a good theory must do.", "He once said, \"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.\" (pensive music) - [Casper] Do you know why Dirac was so drawn to relativity?", "- Einstein went in there and did it all...", "Not all, but almost all by deductive reasoning.", "That made a huge impression on Dirac, right?", "He realized that it was advanced mathematics was really important to understanding the way that nature works.", "- So, Dirac found a new hobby, obsessively updating classical equations with Einstein's theory of relativity, so that they would now work for relative physics scenarios as well that are those approaching the speed of light.", "He later said this was like a game for him, and so it's maybe not too much of a surprise then that he was one of the people trying to unite quantum physics and relativity because a theory that would cover both of these would be truly beautiful in his eyes.", "- Dirac didn't see the beauty in Klein, Gordon, and Fock's relativistic update of the Schrodinger equation, and he wasn't alone.", "Fellow physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, after reading Klein's paper, wrote him a letter, wishing his physics a speedy recovery.", "Pauli was known for being pretty savage.", "And actually, the Klein-Gordon equation is useful in some cases, but he and Dirac were both concerned with one particular feature of the equation.", "- And that's because the Klein-Gordon equation contains this term.", "That's a second-order time derivative.", "So the wave function is being differentiated twice with respect to time.", "Now, remember, the Schrodinger equation also contains a second-order derivative, but that's with space, not with time.", "Time is just first-order.", "So, why is this such a problem?", "Well, think of a very simple second-order time derivative.", "Something like d squared y over dt squared is equal to 3.", "Now, to figure out what y is, the function that satisfies this equation, we just have to integrate it twice.", "(pensive music) (record scratching) But notice, to find the solution, we now two integration constants, c and D.", "And the problem is that we can only find that if we know both y at a given time and if we know the first derivative of y at a given time.", "This makes sense physically, if you think about, say, throwing a ball in the air.", "If you want to predict the ball's future motion, well, then, you need to know where you threw it from, that's its position, and how hard you threw it, that's its velocity.", "Or in other words, you need to know both the position and the first derivative of the position.", "(suspenseful music) - Similarly, to predict a quantum systems future state using the Klein-Gordon equation, you'd need the initial wave function and the initial first derivative of the wave function.", "(suspenseful music) Now, the beauty of the Schrodinger equation was that if you knew only the wave function of a system at a given time, you could use it to determine all the future states of that system.", "But in the Klein-Gordon equation, the wave function no longer told the whole story.", "And this introduced a further problem.", "The probability of finding a particle in a given area could no longer be simply described by the modulus of the wave function, as it was for the Schrodinger equation.", "For the Klein-Gordon equation, a new equation was needed to describe the probability using the wave function, which takes a while to derive, so we won't get into that here, but it looks like this.", "And the problem with that equation is that unlike the simple modulus of the wave function, it can have negative solutions, negative probabilities.", "How can the chance of something happening be less than zero?", "As Dirac put it, that, of course, is physically nonsense.", "(suspenseful music) So, Dirac did what Dirac does best, and he set out to find his own solution that contained no second-order time derivatives.", "First, he rewrote the relativistic energy momentum relationship like this, which is a linear equation.", "So no squaring E, that is no squaring the energy operator, which is what gave rise to that second-order time derivative in the Klein-Gordon equation.", "Now, he just had to solve this equation and find the coefficients, alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta, and he would have a solution.", "(pensive music) To do this, we can start by squaring both sides of the equation.", "Next, we can expand the momentum on the left-hand side into its three dimensions, and then expand the right-hand side to end up with this long equation.", "It might look pretty complicated, but there is a trick we can use.", "(pensive music) And notice that all these terms on the right-hand side are multiplied by pmc cubed, but on the left-hand side, there are no terms containing pmc cubed.", "So that tells us that when you multiply these coefficients together, like the alpha times beta and beta times alphas, all of that must be 0.", "And similarly, notice that these terms are multiplied by two different momenta, like px and py times c squared, which also don't have a counterpart on the left-hand side.", "So these alpha times alpha terms must also be equal to 0.", "And that just leaves this top row.", "These terms do match on both sides, which tells us that alpha x squared must be equal to 1, and so must alpha y squared, alpha z squared, and beta squared.", "So Dirac now had a set of simultaneous equations for alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta that he just needed to solve.", "That sounds easy, right?", "But it's not that straightforward.", "- To see why, let's do some examples.", "So say alpha x is 1 and beta equals minus 1.", "Well, then, we get 1 squared, which is 1, equals minus 1 squared, which is also 1, so that satisfies the top equation.", "But if we fill it in here, we get 1 times minus 1, which is just minus 1, plus minus 1 times 1, which is, again, minus 1, for a total of minus 2.", "So, that doesn't work.", "So, let's try another number.", "Say alpha x is 1, and now it's alpha z that is minus 1.", "Well, in that case, we get 1 times minus 1.", "So, again, we get minus 1, plus minus, 1 times 1, again, minus 1.", "So we, again, get minus 2.", "And in fact, if you look at this top equation, the only numbers that satisfy this relation is 1 and minus 1.", "So all these coefficients have to be either 1 or minus 1, but if you fill that in, then the only two possible answers you're gonna get in these equations is minus 2 or positive 2.", "Now, the two equations that are giving problems are these two, and that's because alpha times beta is the same as beta times alpha.", "So, you're always gonna get minus 2 or 2.", "So, the only way to get out of this is to somehow make the order of multiplication matter.", "But where do you find something like that?", "(pensive music) - Let's think about a really simple vector, say 1 in the x-direction and 2 in the y-direction.", "If I reflect this vector along the line y equals x and then reflect it about the x-axis, I get this.", "But if I start again and instead reflect it first about the x-axis and then along y equals x, I get this, which is totally different.", "So, the order matters.", "How do we express this mathematically?", "We need some way to represent transformations, like reflections as a single coefficient, which means we need matrices.", "Matrices are arrays of numbers which encapsulate these transformations, telling us how to reflect, rotate, stretch, or squish across each dimension.", "Mathematically, the order we multiply them matters.", "Since we multiply the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second, (pensive music) (graphic whooshing) A matrix that reflects along y equals x looks like this and a matrix that reflects about the x-axis looks like this.", "(pensive music) And if I apply them to that original vector one by one, you can see how we end up with different results.", "(pensive music) And actually, using matrices in quantum mechanics was not completely out there.", "Dirac had already seen it done by Werner Heisenberg, his new, if unlikely, friend.", "Dirac and Heisenberg were very different characters.", "Heisenberg was charming and outgoing, Dirac hated socializing and small talk.", "Once the two were on a cruise ship to a conference together and Heisenberg spent a lot of time dancing with women on board.", "So, Dirac asked him, \"Why do you dance?\" Heisenberg replied, \"When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure.\" Dirac thought about this for a bit before saying, \"How do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?\" So, they were pretty different guys, but Heisenberg had a profound impact on Dirac.", "(upbeat music) - Do you know what drew him to quantum mechanics initially?", "- He always said that Heisenberg gave him his start, he always said that.", "In later life, he used to begin lectures when he was 70, even 80 years old, with the following words.", "- Quantum mechanics was discovered by Heisenberg in 1925.", "- As a PhD student, Dirac had closely followed Heisenberg's work, and a few years earlier, Heisenberg had founded for certain properties, like position and momentum.", "The order of multiplication matters.", "So x times p is not the same as p times x.", "This was actually the beginning of Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle, which says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of physical properties in quantum systems.", "It turns out that if the order of multiplication matters for two properties like position and momentum, then that means there's an inherent uncertainty in their combined measurements.", "The order we measure them in will change the outcome.", "Heisenberg's mentor, Max Born, suggested that he could represent this mathematically by using matrices, because there, the order of multiplication also matters.", "(pensive music) This led Heisenberg to a new form of quantum mechanics, which was mathematically equivalent to Schrodinger's equation, but it was based on matrix algebra.", "- Dirac recognized something similar in his coefficients where the order of multiplication clearly mattered.", "So, he thought matrices might be the solution.", "For his coefficients, he tried 2x2 matrices since they're the smallest, simplest matrices that could make the order of multiplication matter.", "He found that some worked with the equations.", "In fact, those reflection matrices we tried earlier worked well, but he just couldn't find solutions for all four coefficients that all worked together.", "- So this is not simple.", "Dirac is one of the smartest people of the 20th century in physics, right?", "But it was not easy.", "You don't have just to twiddle with bits of the Schrodinger equation.", "You'd have to do something completely radical.", "His working is in there, and you could see him really struggling.", "- Then, Dirac had a stroke of genius.", "He said, \"I suddenly realized that there was no need to stick to quantities, which can be represented by matrices with just two rows and columns.", "Why not go to four rows and columns?\" (compelling music) With these four 4x4 matrices, Dirac got these solutions to his simultaneous equations, a matrix with 1s on the diagonal is mathematically equivalent to a 1, and a whole array of 0s is the same thing as 0.", "So, all of the equations were satisfied.", "Dirac had found coefficients that worked.", "Now, we can substitute those matrices back into Dirac's linear equation, then rewrite the three momenta and alpha coefficients as vectors.", "And just as we did with the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations, we can use the energy and momentum operators to make both sides act on the wave function.", "If we substitute those operators in, we get Dirac's final equation for the relativistic free electron.", "(compelling music) The young man who spent his life looking for mathematical beauty had found, perhaps, his most beautiful equation of all.", "- The people were expecting the solution to be horrible, and it turned out to be a thing of beauty, right?", "It was something you look at and you think, \"That is absolutely amazing.\" It's a pattern that Dirac found deep in nature.", "Nothing like that has been seen in physics at that time.", "(suspenseful music) - To see some of that beauty, you only have to compare it to the Schrodinger equation, which you can see right here.", "Now, the two look very similar, but there is a lot hidden in the Dirac equation.", "First of all, it's relativistic, so it works at really, really high speeds because it uses Einstein's energy momentum relationship, unlike the Schrodinger equation which breaks down there.", "But what's even more beautiful is that if you look at this, Dirac's equation isn't just first order in time derivatives, it's also first order in spatial derivatives.", "Whereas the Schrodinger equation was second order in spatial derivatives.", "So you might wonder, \"Well, why does that matter?\" Well, because not only does going first order in all derivatives solve the second-order time derivative problem of the Klein-Gordon equation, it now also treats time and space symmetrically.", "And it becomes really important if you start thinking about relativity, where time and space are not separate dimensions, they're intertwined in a four dimensional spacetime.", "And while the Schrodinger equation had just a single component wave function, to make the wave function work with these 4x4 matrices, in Dirac's case, you actually need a wave function that has four components.", "So, it'll look something like this.", "Psi one, psi two, psi three, and psi four.", "- The four-component wave function means that the Dirac equation describes four possible states for any quantum system, which reveals something Schrödinger's single wave function didn't.", "An electron at a given energy level actually has two possible states due to different orientations of its intrinsic angular momentum, spin up and spin down.", "(pensive music) This spin creates a tiny magnetic field.", "So these two states are like tiny magnets pointing in opposite directions, and that has an interesting implication.", "Take hydrogen, which has one proton and one electron.", "Classically, the electron whizzes around the proton.", "But if you switch to the perspective of the electron, well, now, it's the proton that's moving.", "And since it's positively charged, that moving charge creates a magnetic field in the electron's frame of reference.", "So, now you've got this electron, which has its own mini magnetic field, interacting with a larger magnetic field, and that interaction will be slightly different for a spin up and a spin down electron.", "And as a result, some energy levels of the electron split into two closely-spaced energy levels.", "And you can actually see this if you zoom into the emission spectrum for a hydrogen atom.", "(suspenseful music) Schrödinger's equation didn't predict that splitting since it just had one solution for each energy level.", "But with Dirac's four-component solution, the top two wave functions now described two different spin states with two slightly different energies.", "- Dirac admitted himself that he had never set out to capture spin in his equation.", "- I started out this work without any intention at all of bringing in the spin of the electron.", "- [Casper] But hold on, because if an electron at a given energy level only has two possible spin states, then why do we have a four-component wave function?", "Why are there four states and not just two?", "(compelling music) - [Derek] Well, that's what brings us back to that 1928 lecture at the start, the one that seemed to drive even the most well-established quantum physicists mad.", "Because that strange man presenting his work was actually Paul Dirac sharing his new equation with the world.", "It was Dirac's beautiful equation that Heisenberg called, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" (somber music) - To understand why all those physicists were losing their minds, we only have to look at the simple case when a particle is at rest.", "This term right here describes the momentum.", "So, when the particle doesn't move, this becomes 0 and it drops out, which gives us this.", "Next, we can sub in the energy for this quantum operator to get this.", "So now, we know that beta times mc squared must be equal to the particle's energy.", "And if we write out beta and multiplied by mc squared, then we find two positive solutions and two negative solutions for the energy.", "So, negative energy solutions are baked right into the Dirac equation.", "(pensive music) This idea that a free electron could have negative energy was impossible for any of these physicists to accept.", "Because think about it.", "If electrons can have a negative energy, then that means that they could continually radiate positive energy, that is emit photons, and drop into lower and lower negative energy states.", "There would be no limit to how far they could fall into the negative energy abyss.", "(compelling music) - It looked like, to many very smart people, and Dirac was smart enough to know they had a point, that this equation, it got the mass and the magnetic moment of the electron.", "Yes, but on the other hand, it predicts this ridiculous situation, where you have negative energy values.", "- Right.", "- That's nonsense.", "So, Heisenberg said, \"I give up.", "This is just ridiculous.\" So, Dirac, he had, in some very clear sense, had to rescue his equation.", "(pensive music) - [Derek] Dirac spent three years sticking to his guns.", "He tried all sorts of ways to interpret his new equation to explain where the negative energy was coming from.", "Then, in 1931, he proposed something radical to explain the negative energy solutions.", "(suspenseful music) A new kind of particle unknown to experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron.", "We may call such a particle an anti-electron.", "We should not expect to find any of them in nature on account of their rapid rate of recombination with electrons.", "(suspenseful music) So, Dirac was proposing that those four states described in his four-component wave function are a spin up electron, a spin down electron, a spin up antielectron, and a spin down antielectron.", "- When Dirac said that, people didn't start running around saying, \"Where's this antielectron?\" They just ignored it.", "- Yeah.", "- Cut to the laboratory at Caltech.", "- In 1932, a Caltech postdoc named Carl Anderson was working on a project trying to identify the charge particles produced by cosmic rays.", "He photographed the tracks these particles left in a cloud chamber containing a uniform magnetic field.", "Anderson noticed several instances of a similar track.", "It looked a lot like the tracks he'd seen left by electrons.", "Only, it curved in the opposite direction in the magnetic field.", "Kind of like the tracks of positively charged protons.", "But there was no way it could be a proton based on the length of the track.", "It had traveled farther in air, and therefore it had to be much lighter.", "It had to be something with around the same mass as an electron, but opposite charge.", "A positive electron, or as he named it, a positron.", "He actually also tried to rebrand electrons as negatrons, but that one didn't quite stick.", "Just one year after Dirac proposed the antielectron, Carl Anderson found it entirely by accident.", "(uplifting music) - But this alone doesn't get rid of the negative energy problem.", "Remember what we said earlier.", "If any particles, like these positrons, can have negative energy, then they could continually radiate energy and drop into lower and lower negative energy states.", "Fortunately, Dirac proposed a solution to this problem as well, although it was a little crazy.", "(suspenseful music) - He theorized something called the Dirac sea, describing a vacuum as an infinite sea of electrons occupying all available negative energy states.", "And since no two electrons can occupy the same state, this prevents observable positive energy electrons from falling into the negative energy states.", "A hole or vacancy in this sea then becomes a positron.", "When an electron and a positron meet and annihilate, well, that's just an electron falling back into the sea and filling that hole.", "The theory is mathematically sound.", "Of course, it's Dirac we're talking about, but if you feel like it's hard to come to terms with the idea that we're floating on an infinite sea of electrons, well, you wouldn't be alone.", "- It's not even that crazy if, I don't know, several decades later, people find that exact model in a physical system.", "In condensed matter physics, you see an exact analogy of also having electrons in the conduction band and say valence-covalence band.", "- Yes, that's true.", "That's true.", "But Dirac really was, you know, out there.", "You see what I mean?", "Maybe it was people like...", "He doesn't see it, really seeing that people are saying, \"This is nonsense.\" But it was a way of Dirac's rectilinear thinking, thinking, \"Well maybe this is...\" And then it drove him to antimatter.", "- Thankfully, in 1941, a Swiss physicist named Ernst Stueckelberg had a clever idea.", "The way function contains a term that looks like this, where energy is multiplied by time.", "So, we can see that if we just change the sign of time when the energy is negative, then we get the same result because a negative multiplied by a negative gives us a positive.", "Stueckelberg took this, and he suggested that negative energy electrons traveling backwards in time are mathematically equivalent to positive energy antielectrons, that is positrons, traveling forwards in time.", "- A few years later, around 1948, Richard Feynman took this idea and used it in one of the most powerful tools in modern physics, the Feynman diagrams.", "In his sketches of particle interactions, he showed antiparticles traveling the opposite way to particles backwards in time.", "(pensive music) It was a brilliant trick.", "Negative energy solutions no longer had to mean there was negative energy or a Dirac sea.", "They simply indicated the presence of an antiparticle.", "(suspenseful music) We now know that there's a corresponding antiparticle for every subatomic particle, with the same mass, but opposite charge.", "So, the proton has the antiproton, the neutrino has the antineutrino, and so on.", "- According to his friend, Heisenberg, that was the biggest leap in 20th-century physics to say there's a whole slew of antiparticles corresponding to particles, and Dirac got that through this crazy model.", "(pensive music) - But all is not solved.", "This new antiworld introduces some big questions about the very nature of our universe.", "Because particles and their antiparticles are equal and opposite, when they come together, they annihilate and produce two photons with energy equivalent to their mass and kinetic energy.", "And this process is reversible.", "Two photons with the right energies can produce a matter and antimatter pair.", "This is called Breit-Wheeler pair production.", "(suspenseful music) (Big Bang exploding) During the first moments after the Big Bang, the universe was hot, dense, and full of these pairs popping into and out of existence.", "If an equal number of matter and antimatter particles were created, you would expect them to all annihilate each other in this dense environment, leaving behind only energy.", "But that didn't happen.", "We ended up with a universe full of matter.", "If we work backwards from how much matter and antimatter is in the universe today, it's actually estimated that only one particle per billion of matter needed to survive this hot, dense era and not get annihilated.", "That tiny difference would give us the makeup of our universe today, where matter dominates.", "- So what allowed that one particle per billion to escape annihilation?", "Why did matter win out over antimatter?", "(compelling music) Well, that's a pretty big question with some not so simple answers.", "So, we're doing an entire second video where we have some pretty spectacular stuff happening.", "We're getting into the beast.", "It's absolutely insane.", "I feel like I should not be in here.", "So you're making anti-atoms?", "- Yes.", "(energy humming) - [Casper] It's so cool.", "(compelling music) - Dirac is probably less well-known than people like Heisenberg or Schrödinger, but his contribution to quantum physics was immense, and he was recognized for it.", "He shared the 1933 Nobel Prize with Schrödinger for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory.", "And perhaps this gave strange, quiet Dirac some newfound confidence, because that physicist in the audience of his 1928 lecture at the start, Eugene Wigner, actually became a reasonable friend of Dirac's.", "And in 1934, introduced Dirac to his sister, Margit Wigner, a woman who would change Dirac's life, perhaps more than any equation or Nobel Prize.", "(pensive music) - They were antiparticles, right?", "They had completely different personalities.", "He had almost no empathy, right?", "And he knew it.", "She had buckets of it.", "He hardly talked, she couldn't stop talking.", "You could just go on, like they are completely different people.", "But the marriage did work.", "My great friend Lilia Harris Chandra, who knew them, she came out with a great line, great line, which is, \"He gave her status, she gave him a life.\" - So, I guess there is one particle-antiparticle pair that never annihilated.", "(pensive music) (graphic

It turns out the alive part of a tree is  just a tiny, paper thin strip of cells, trapped between a dead skeleton and dead outsides. Trees are some of the most extreme beings on  earth with one of the most unique strategies in nature – on top of being mostly dead stuff, they  forge their body out of thin air, they mercilessly crush rocks with acid, and they have an internal  negative pressure that would kill you instantly. So, how do trees actually work? Let’s go back…to the beginning. The Ancient Battle for the Sky For over a billion years the ancestors of plants only inhabited the sun  drenched surfaces of the oceans. Their bodies were thin and delicate  and absorbed water straight through their surfaces, getting their  energy through photosynthesis. Forging sunlight, carbon  dioxide and water into sugar. But about 470 million years ago they decided  to conquer a hostile alien planet: the land. Like green rugs with ambition these  plant ancestors began clinging to the ground wherever it was wet and damp. But now, with solid ground beneath  and no ability to float around a new dimension became a place of intense warfare: up. The higher they grew, the more sun they would  get, while starving their competition below. Height became a deadly weapon.  The battle for the sky had begun. Until now, plants were built mostly from  cellulose, which was great for shape, but not for strength, which  limited how tall they could grow. Over dozens of millions of  years of evolutionary warfare, a group of plants developed one of  life's greatest breakthroughs: lignin. Lignin is a macromolecule made  of ring-shaped structures. It is rigid, tough, waterproof,  and incredibly hard to break down. Concrete in a world made of jelly. It filled gaps between cellulose threads,  stiffening and locking everything into place. Lignin gave plants the strength to grow  taller and claim the sun for themselves. But of course now they were  competing with each other, which must have been really annoying for them. So as more millions of years passed,  some plants just went all in on lignin and produced more and more of it,  becoming stiffer, harder and stronger. Until one day, around 385 million years ago they got the biological equivalent of  steel reinforced concrete: wood. More on it later, but with this magic  material the first trees emerged. Almost immediately they became  the largest living beings alive, shooting up to 20 meters high into the  sky – and they only got bigger from here. But this enormous size created  extremely hard problems: How do you get water from the ground up to the  green parts that do the actual photosynthesis? And how do you get the sugar they produce  down to the cells that keep you up there? On the scale of a cell a distance of  a few meters is like you’re working in Britain while your lunch box is  in Egypt and your drink in New York. How do you not die? So trees came up with one of the  most amazing ways any organism grows, and became nearly immortal by accident. A Conveyor Belt of Death Let us slice an ancient tree in half  and get to the heart running it all: the cambium, a razor-thin, circular  zone, just a few stem cells wide. These stem cells grow inward and outwards,  turning into two groups of specialists. The inward specialists are on a  conveyor belt of death, the xylem. With each new division it is  pushing the cambium outwards, making the tree thicker the older it gets. As the xylem cells mature their  lignin production goes into overdrive, and they become hard and stuffy, like  a muscle slowly transforming into bone. They begin to hollow themselves out, shedding  everything that once made them alive. And then they die. What’s left is a corpse, a hard, empty tube. As the tree grows year after year, new  corpses are layered on old corpses, forming rings of hardened, dead tissue. A graveyard of trillions of plant bones. This is what we call wood. Stacked together they form a giant network of  pipes that stretches the whole length of the tree. This network uses the chemical properties of water and a few other tricks to move  it with incredible efficiency. Water molecules are, for a lack of a  better word, sticky, like tiny magnets, and naturally cling tightly to each other. When one moves, it pulls the next  along with it, like pulling on a rope. In trees this rope starts in the roots and ends in  the leaves that bathe in the warmth from the sun. Here the heat from the sun evaporates 95% of the water that got sucked into the  roots, from billions of tiny pores, releasing a constant invisible mist of water  molecules around the crown of the tree. This process, called transpiration in plants,  creates tension on the rope of water molecules, stretching and lifting the entire column upwards,  all the way from the roots to the leaves. This pull is so insanely strong that  it can lift water over 100 meters, which requires sucking forces  equivalent to the pressure of dozens of atmospheres – as much as the crushing  pressure hundreds of meters deep in the ocean. Nothing humans have ever built  comes even close to this power. Even our best machines can’t pull  water higher than about 10 meters, because the negative pressure required  to pull hard enough makes it boil. But the water pipes of trees are so tiny  and narrow, almost perfectly airtight that despite the insane suction pressure inside a  tree, water stays liquid and reaches the top. As the tree ages old xylem cells  eventually stop working and fill up with resins and other protective substances. Slowly they turn into heartwood, a dense, chemically fortified core that  is extremely resistant to decay. The core of a mighty tree. But water is only one half of the story. The sugar produced in the sky needs to be  transported to nourish cells down below. And cells from the roots to  the leaves need to coordinate and exchange information about damage and growth. This is the job of the cambium stem  cells that grow outwards: the phloem. The Tiny Living Part of the Tree As the Cells of the phloem  grow outwards they separate into three teams and make a brutal compromise. The first group are Sieve cells and their grim  fate is to become a living transport system. Although “living” is not exactly right. As they mature they start to destroy themselves, digest their organelles and even their  nuclei that houses their genetic code. At the same time they hollow themselves out, connecting to the sieve  cells above and below them. This goes on until they are a  sad shadow of living beings. A drooling, living tool without a brain  or arms, unable to support themselves. Only the second group, their  companion cells, keeps them alive. They connect with the crippled Sieve cells  via tiny channels and start maintaining them. Sending over energy, instructions  or repairing them if needed. Running along the entire tree, these  two teams form a tiny and very thin layer of living sugar pipelines and signal  cables that stretch throughout the entire body. Providing food and information  wherever it is needed in the tree. The third team are Parenchyma cells, the silent workers of the tree that are carrying  out essential labor in the background. Some are like mini pantries that store nutrients, sugars or water that the tree uses to survive  the winter, when it is unable to produce food. Others are like mini healers that can  repair damage, while some go onto the offensive and create toxins and anti  fungal bio weapons to kill intruders. On top of the phloem sits  another layer of stem cells. They are producing a second conveyor  belt of death, moving outside. Special cells grow from this layer and as they  mature, just like the xylem cells in the center, they kill themselves for the team,  turning into a hard guard wall – the bark. Just like your skin, it protects the tiny living  layer from damage, parasites and invaders. So what is a tree? The living part of the stem is really  just this extremely thin and tiny layer, a few millimeters thick, sitting on  a thick mountain of cell corpses, surrounded by another layer of cell corpses. The vast majority of the  biomass of a tree is dead. This is also why you really should not  damage the bark of trees because while it seems you are only doing a little damage, you  are actually killing the living part of the tree. But unless a tree is stopped by droughts,  diseases, storms or a human axe, this system of being mostly dead kind  of makes trees potentially immortal. They don’t age like we do, in principle  they could grow this way nearly forever. Which is why we still have trees  around that were born when the Egyptians started building their  first pyramid, 5000 years ago. Really what kills a tree is the world around it. Trees are not a real biological category but one  of the most successful ideas life has ever had, and many different species developed on their own. These plants won the battle for the sky,  solved every challenge that had kept plants small and fragile and they took  over the planet in a few million years. Even today three trillion of  them cast their majestic shadows. But we’ve barely covered half of it:  on top and below there are the crown and the root system – one building  the tree from air, another mining minerals with acid and involved in complex  communications with fungi and other trees. There’s so much more to talk about, so we’re  already working on the next part - stay tuned! Trees are truly incredible – but many  of our most beautiful forests are disappearing fast and we’re running  out of time to protect what’s left. That’s why we have partnered up with Planet Wild. Planet Wild is a community-based  nature protection organization that supports conservation  projects around the globe. Every month, their community of over 15,000  members funds a new mission to restore nature. We at kurzgesagt really value transparency. That’s why we love that Planet Wild  documents all their missions in video reports right here on YouTube so you can  see what your contribution helped achieve. Take their underground forest mission in Tanzania: While you think this desert is dead,  there’s actually life still here. Beneath the surface, underground  forests are just waiting to grow. And with an ancient technique,  Planet Wild helped make that happen. If you would like to help our planet’s  ecosystems, consider joining Planet Wild. You can give any amount that feels  right to you – every dollar counts. The first 100 people to sign up using our code KURZGESAGT11 will get their  first month paid for by us!

Oh, you hate it? You are not alone! One in four people with a tattoo  regret it, 25 million people in the US. Getting ink carved into your body permanently has exploded in popularity in the last few  decades, especially among Millennials. Often their tattoos were about a current cultural  thing, a moment in their life, following a trend, expressing individuality or about feeling  like being part of something greater. This is all fine and good but  as people age they often stop identifying with what their younger  versions wanted on their skin forever. Or sometimes their tattoos simply  just look ugly or have aged badly. And so today laser tattoo removal is booming,  being as normalized as dentist appointments. Which is wild since lasering a tattoo away is one  of the most metal things you can do to your body. A high tech procedure that is extremely painful  and makes your skin explode from the inside. How does it work? We explained what a tattoo is in  detail before, but in a nutshell: From the perspective of your cells  your tattoo is a mountain range of colourful boulders, from small to building-sized. Injected deep into your dermis by violently  ripping huge wounds with gigantic needles. Your body is trying hard to destroy  the tattoo, but the ink particles are way too large to be transported away  and your immune cells can’t eat them. So they do the next best thing: Keeping the ink trapped in a prison of flesh. This is why tattoos remain forever,  millions of your cells give their lives to keep the ink in place – when  they die new ones take their place. In principle removing a tattoo is very easy: Just destroy the ink particles. The hard part is to do that  without destroying you. Amazingly the best way is still  to blast you with a deadly laser. Lasers, UV light, wifi or  x-rays are all the same thing: Electromagnetic radiation, photons that travel through space at the  speed of light in the form of a wave. The more energetic they are, the higher their  frequency and the more punch they carry. Imagine your skin as jelly and  your tattoo as crumbs of toast. If you shine a flashlight against  it, most light passes right through the jelly – but the darker toast crumbs  absorb more light and are clearly visible. Likewise, certain laser frequencies mostly  pass through your skin without doing damage, while dark ink particles soak them up. Depending on the colour of your  tattoo, we need different lasers. Red ink reflects red light but absorbs  green light – so you need a green laser. Black ink easily absorbs all types of  light and is the easiest to remove. But even with the right colour, tattoo removal  lasers are still pretty powerful and can still leave horrible injuries, scars, or  change your skin colour permanently. So instead of shooting your skin  with a continuous ray of death, modern tattoo removal lasers shoot  an extremely brief pulse – a packet of electromagnetic energy that lasts  about a few trillionoth of a second. So short that the beam ends before  the first photon even hits the skin! Ok, enough theory. Let’s laser your mistake away and experience  the fun of tattoo removal together!

Let us slow down time… zapp The pulse of high energy photons hits  your arm nearly at the speed of light, shooting through the dead layers of  the skin, passing into the dermis. Most cells are like jelly to the  laser and don’t absorb much energy, escaping its deadly power unharmed. The flood of photons moves  on and reaches the mountain range of ink embedded deep in the  prison of your flesh and cells. Only a nanosecond, a billionth of a second,  has passed but now things escalate rapidly. As the photons hit the black ink on  a molecular level, they smash into electrons and are absorbed and annihilated –  transferring all of their energy into them. This sudden influx of energy  almost instantly turns into a massive amount of heat that has nowhere to go. The ink particles burn up to a seething hot 600  degrees, hot enough to make iron glow red hot. Overwhelmed by the sudden heat the  ink particles expand rapidly and are mechanically stressed to the max, violently  ripping and fracturing, almost exploding. The mountain range cracks into millions of  seething hot pieces and a bit of hot ink dust. Which would not be that bad if this  was not going on inside your skin. Water in your tissue and inside your cells  instantly vaporizes and expands quickly. Ripping cells apart and growing into gigantic  caves of hot steam bubbles inside your skin. This sudden expansion creates a  shockwave that hits tissue nearby, causing more mayhem and damage. Your cells that were keeping the tattoo in  place a moment ago are having a really bad time. If they had kept tattoo particles safely stowed  inside of them they are cooked or ripped apart. The cells that surrounded the ink mountains are gravely wounded or burned alive  by the sudden heat or steam. A few tiny blood vessels in the  area are ripped apart violently. Thousands of your cells are dead or hurt. And then the next laser pulse hits again, and again, moving over the tattoo  like an orbital bombardment. From your perspective all of this is happening  so fast that you only notice one thing: A sharp pain like being electrocuted, a smell like  burnt hair and most disturbingly, a loud crack. Where the laser hits your tattoo  instantly turns white – which is called frosting and is the bubbles  of hot gas expanding under your skin. To ease the pain the area is often cooled  with a stream of cold air for a moment, before the laser moves on again. Inside your skin the tattoo is now a  crushed mountain range of carnage and death. The cooked and ripped remains of cells float in a mix of hot ink and water  vapor that are cooling down. Many more cells are injured and  are chemically screaming for help. It's like an internal burn wound. The Brutal Aftermath Hundreds of thousands of  immune cells like Macrophages, stream into the wound to clean up the mess. They order inflammation so your blood  vessels open up and water rushes in. Your wounded skin starts to swell up and turn red. As your cells begin cleaning up  casualties and helping with wound healing they also meet loads of hot ink particles. It‘s now that your tattoo is  actually being removed – the same immune system that kept it in  place is now helping to clean it up. Many of the smallest particles are  simply rinsed away by the flood, while Macrophages devour some of them  and transport them to your lymph nodes. If possible they will be broken down  further and ejected from your body via your urine – if not then they will just collect  inside your lymph nodes and stay there, probably for the rest of your life. So hopefully you got the tattoo  from a pro and the ink is not toxic. But the majority of ink particles are either still  too large or there are just too many of them. So your immune and skin cells  – in a brave effort to protect you – once again swallow and bind them in place. This is why a laser tattoo removal usually  takes between 5 and 12 sessions – each time a part of the tattoo is transported away and  an even larger one is cemented in place again. You get to enjoy watching this  process happening in real time. Within the first few hours the frosting under your skin fades and the skin around the  tattoo feels like a bad sunburn. Red, swollen and stingy. Often it rises with fluid filled burn  blisters that you should leave alone. As the pain calms down it is replaced by soreness. Over the next few days the wound will remain red, swollen and tender and begin to itch –  the itching is a direct consequence of your immune cells actively healing you,  so maybe that gives you some comfort. After about a week the wound may crust over as  new healthy and pink skin replaces injured skin. Things slowly get back to normal. Your tattoo will usually be noticeably lighter, although not that much if  this was your first session. Over the next few weeks it will  get a bit lighter still as your immune system keeps transporting parts of it away. Modern laser tattoo removal has gotten very good, so if you chose an experienced professional  you should be completely healed after two months – but if you did not or if you  had the procedure done with older tech, sometimes there might be a slight scar or the  colour of your skin may change slightly in places. Although this is pretty rare nowadays, please do your research when deciding who  you’re going to allow to shoot lasers at you. In the best case, after a number of sessions, your tattoo is no longer visible,  or only very, very faintly. Whetherit will disappear completely  depends on the size of your tattoo, the colours that were used, how  deep the ink was injected and to a degree – how good of a job your  body does cleaning up the mess.

Genius of Lau Noah", "language": "en", "content": "So this is Lau Noah. She is a Catalan composer and songwriter that I think is one of music's best kept secrets. Her music is harmonically dense and lyrically rich. Which explains why she has collaborated with the crocked one himself, Jacob Collier, alongside many virtuoso musicians like Shai Maestro and Chris Thile. Her music is just unlike anything that I've ever heard before. Check it out, man. This stuff is crazy. It's colorful and intense. The key changes are surprising and evocative. But what is so mind boggling about this stuff is that she is self-taught. She does not know any music theory, and this was apparently one of the first compositions she ever wrote. I can barely wrap my head around this. How do you have such deep harmonic language without the technical training? I asked Lau a little bit about her process. The very much like, let's harmonize every freaking note you're singing with the guitar. So just place my fingers randomly here. And then I went note by note with my voice, you know, and found a melody on my voice that matched the guitar. Is that not by not? Yeah. It's not groundbreaking. It's just harder work than other people. You play things that are ergonomic that makes sense for the shape of the human hand. And he tried to make it look as if and sound as if it was much harder than it is, but it's not that difficult. Okay, so I guess on the surface it's not that hard. You take idiomatic shapes to the guitar and then you harmonize those shapes with your voice. But there clearly is some more stuff going on here. There are key changes. There are complex seventh chords. There's things that I would identify as something like a II-V-I progression. Do you just pick up that stuff from exposure and osmosis? How do you learn to write with this harmony intuitively? I was part of the jazz world for a while, was just watching people. Would you say that that's where you got a lot of your harmonic language or. I think it's a blend between that exposure of many years of more complex harmonic language from the jazz world, but also all the Disney soundtracks I was obsessed with as a kid. There is a lot of complexity in that language as well. I think the most genius composers are the ones who bring in that complexity, making it feel and sound so universal. You are too beautiful, my dear to be true and I'm a fool for beauty, yeah oh by a feeling that because I found you I could have bound you too Intuitively I understand the need for the architecture of the song. And it's the same as writing a book or cooking a dish, really. You know, when there's too much green on the plate and you need like a. A change of something. This is in which. This is very jazz language, I guess, instead of going like you go, fool by a feeling. And again, very expected harmony here. Fooled by a feeling then Because I found you. Is that right? You talk about that chord. Yeah, that's just because you can. It's funny. It's there for you to use it. You know, you just gotta play it. First of all, the chord can hold on itself because it's one of the most beautiful chords ever. Yeah. And so. Makes sense. Makes sense in terms of the plot of the song for one of you to be. Well, Wonder Woman with eyes of the road to see. Yeah. Part of the reason why I know Lau is because she's based in New York City and has a wonderful community of musicians that have learned her. I really dig her arrangements with guitarist Yoav Esged, for example. And, you know, I've been playing her stuff for about three or four years now. And part of what's been exciting working with her is seeing how many traditions she draws from and makes her own. You've been very influenced by Americana and, like, country music. I think my appeal for Americana and folk music is what they achieve in people. It's quite surreal because they are grabbing something that has to be so core, so centered in human emotion. With carvings of pretty rose and the bird in the middle with wing so white to hold me when that day I was like, why? Why can Chris Stapleton play this four chord song? And I feel like listening to this a thousand times more than anything else that I've been listening to that has, like millions of chords in it. Why do you still play millions of chords then? I think the goal is to try and find a way to play the millions of chords and make it sound like it's four, you know, to make it sound. Yeah. Again, like. Like a good story, Like a good book. My days and my years will not matter the chair is a tear till you get it A heart, a heart is a heart Till you break it apart and part of this all was for you from the start Sing along that you were it's like I would say in a good movie, like the Bridges of Madison county, it's a love story. Now you have the scene of the first kiss. That first kiss is this song. Four chords. It's a feeling. It doesn't matter. It's just two people joining body parts. That make everybody feel something. Everybody who's got a heart feels something. But if you go there without an amazing story before it, it's just cringe. How do you make that kiss amazing? It has to be difficult to get to that point. It has to be interesting. There to be a lot of, like, elements around. That's the thing. Like, you have to get far away enough so that coming back is exciting. In Pirates of the Caribbean, they're trying to rescue Jack Sparrow from the world of the dead. Captain Barbossa is the one leading everybody, and he has no idea where they are. And he goes, like, to find places that no one goes to, you have to get lost. I love this so much. I've talked all the time on this channel about the importance of harmonic choices on narrative, how these technical musical decisions can impact story and drama and emotion. But let's zoom in and soy Jack a little bit at her harmonic choices. How exactly are we getting lost here? I actually really think that what I'm doing is finding these very folky patterns of, like, what's this game, this American game of slides and staircases? Chutes and Ladders. Chutes and Ladders. It's called Chutes and Ladders. It's Chutes and Ladders. My skill is to know where to put a ladder, to climb up to a different key, to make it sound seamless, and to just really repeat those very folky, stable grounded patterns. But switching keys in the middle. The story of getting lost and finding your way back home can be expressed not through just words, but also musical phrases and musical decisions. In the case of the bridge to this tune, Wooden Chair, Lau expresses that through both melody and harmony. For example, this phrase is built by targeting a series of ascending minor third intervals that don't adhere to any particular key, creating tension in a literal rising action of the story, which is resolved to a falling action, a denouement in the key, a descending scalar pattern. There's a chair till you give it a heart Heart is a heart till you break it apart. Because you're like, where are you? Then that brings you back to the. To the center. There has to be, like, instability to balance, to instability, to stability. And that game is what makes everything interesting. This journey can also be expressed through harmony. And I want to talk a little bit about that. The bridge starts with this chromatic bass line moving upwards. We start on an E flat harmonized with an E flat major chord. The IV chord followed by an E harmonized with a CAD 2 over E followed by an F harmonized with an F major chord, the V chord, followed by a G flat or A C minor 7 flat 5 over G flat. Now, my jazz brain hears that and immediately interprets it as some form of a D7 chord. It is a rootless voicing of a D7, B9, B13, because that sound resolves up a half step in the next measure to a G minor 7 by the river. The pattern matching that I've been trained to do hears this as some kind of V chord resolving to one. Now, when I am improvising, or when any jazz musician improvises, we are constantly relating the sounds that we hear to this technical language of five going to one, because our vocabulary is intimately tied to that language. But that language can cloud our perspective because it assumes that these musical choices were made with that language in mind. And in this case, they weren't. The way I find the chords is by testing, trying to figure out the best sounding chord, the closest to the chord I played before. So just look at my hand as I play these three chords. You notice how my fingers were barely moving. Everything just kind of like fit underneath my hand. So in traditional counterpoint, this stuff that I learned in music school, there's something called parsimonious voice leading, which says that when you switch chords, you want every note, every voice, to move as little as possible from chord to chord. And what we could say is that when we do this kind of movement on a guitar, when you're moving the fingers as little as possible, you're engaged in parsimonious guitar fingering. This was the first step. This is the shape of what we're working with. When you play it like this, it sounds good. When you play it like that, it sounds good, you know? This idea can be used to explain chords which are hard to explain otherwise. For example, the next several chords in the song are C sharp diminished to D minor to D diminished to f sharp minor 6, which is hard to pin down to a key, especially if you're looking at the harmony from the perspective of a piano. However, when you play them on guitar, you see that the chords flow from one to the next very easily. The pinky finger stays on that second string, and the other fingers slide around in an ergonomic fashion. The composition is justified by the kinesthetic. Pretty cool. These compositional choices can only be understood through the lens of guitar fingering, choices made not purely by the sound, but by the athletics of producing the sound. Very much, I think, kind of like metal riffs. Metal riffs feel awesome to play they sound awesome. And yet, if you try and apply the lens of functional melody or functional harmony to metal riffs, often they look nonsensical. The inertia of your hand going from one place to another, that feels good. Also sounds good. I think that makes sense. My big point here, and this is maybe a little dangerous to say as a music theory guy on YouTube, but naming something forces a perspective on it. If you name a sound five going to one, chances are that's then your experience of it. It's harder to hear it as anything else. It's harder to be aware of the frequency response of the sound. For example, you're not listening for 500 Hz, you're listening for five going to one. It's harder to be aware of the kinesthetic response of the sound. You're not aware of the finger movements. You're just aware of the five going to one. It's harder to be aware of the Pirates of the Caribbean response to the sound. You're not aware of the story of it all. You're just aware of five going to one. If you're intensely interested in botany and are aware of the scientific names of all the different species of trees, you may quite literally miss the forest for the trees. Yeah, I am definitely afraid of learning the technical language. And the fear is that I will become way less free. And I know it's not the case for many people, and many people have made a very clear point that so and so and so actually benefited so much from learning and all this, and that expanded their horizons. In my case, I just don't have enough proof that that's true. The older I get and the more music I make and the more complicated music I make, the less I am conscious of what things are called. Because, as Lau shows, the deeper you go, the more your perspective needs to shift to other. Other beautiful things that connect myself to the music and the people around me. The perspective of an athlete, for example, who is deeply conscious of every motion of their body in pursuit of something great and meaningful. The perspective of a storyteller who is deeply concerned about the narrative beats of a scene, how drama, intrigue, conflict and resolution are so deeply felt in musical choices and what that might communicate about the human experience. Lau and I come from very different worlds, but ultimately, I think we're concerned with the same thing, which is music as a direct line to experience. The way we get there is different, but I think we're equally as passionate about the beauty that can be found in sound and story. It's in that spirit that Lau and I have written an EP together. It's entitled the Way Under. It's a collection of bass guitar and classical guitar duets that explore both of our perspectives and how they're not actually all that different. My instructions for this next take are to do that Ricky Martin thing. I don't know exactly what she means by that, but, you know. I know. Okay. I know exactly what she means by that. It means play some bullshit. We have a very similar way of perceiving beauty, and that's not a given, you know, and that's a very important one. There's a shared language there. Okay, that. Okay, yeah, yeah. You just want me to do that? Okay, fine. Adam, everybody wants you to do that. Embrace your nature. Yes. Yeah, exactly what stop doing while we're recording. I think it was the first time. Yeah. Someone was actually creating their own world to match mine. For me, it's a way to explore from someone else's unknown into my unknown. And I'm just looking forward to the palette that will happen over time when we write more music together. Book us for gigs. Let's go. Yeah. Oh, thanks, Lao. Yeah, thank you. You can go check out the Way under wherever you stream your music, and also go check out Lau's music wherever you stream your music. I gotta say, it's very exciting to start working with her. I have another writing partner alongside Shawn Crowder, who appreciates lots of notes. And, you know, as a person who. Who enjoys notes and the combinations that can be made thereof, it's very exciting to start working with somebody else, and I'm excited to see where all of this stuff goes.

How are you? (Audience) Good. It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter) If you work in education, you're not asked. (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God. Why me?\" (Laughter) \"My one night out all week.\" (Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) That was it, by the way. Thank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) \"Well, I was born ... \" (Laughter) I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will in a minute.\" (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it. (Laughter) \"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, \"You OK with that?\" They said, \"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\" (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was. (Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) \"Must try harder.\" (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\" To William Shakespeare. \"And put the pencil down!\" (Laughter) \"And stop speaking like that.\" (Laughter) \"It's confusing everybody.\" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. (Laughter) But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities. At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education as an alien and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors. In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings. (Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night. (Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat. (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it. (Laughter) Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? \"Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.\" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ... thankfully. (Laughter) No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.\" (Laughter) \"Give me a break.\" (Laughter) Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, \"If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?\" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\" (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day. I said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian has a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that. (Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said, \"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back. We won't be very long,\" and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, \"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\" I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. (Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years, all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much. (Applause)", "sentences": ["Good morning.", "How are you?", "(Audience) Good.", "It's been great, hasn't it?", "I've been blown away by the whole thing.", "In fact, I'm leaving.", "(Laughter) There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about.", "One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it.", "The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future.", "No idea how this may play out.", "I have an interest in education.", "Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education.", "Don't you?", "I find this very interesting.", "If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.", "(Laughter) If you work in education, you're not asked.", "(Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously.", "That's strange to me.", "But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face.", "They're like, \"Oh my God.", "Why me?\" (Laughter) \"My one night out all week.\" (Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right?", "Like religion and money and other things.", "So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.", "We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp.", "If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065.", "Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time.", "And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it.", "So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.", "And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation.", "I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she?", "Just seeing what she could do.", "And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood.", "What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent.", "And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.", "So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity.", "My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.", "(Applause) Thank you.", "(Applause) That was it, by the way.", "Thank you very much.", "(Laughter) So, 15 minutes left.", "(Laughter) \"Well, I was born ...", "\" (Laughter) I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.", "She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did.", "The teacher was fascinated.", "She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will in a minute.\" (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.", "(Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.", "He was in the Nativity play.", "Do you remember the story?", "(Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story.", "Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.", "(Laughter) \"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about.", "We considered this to be one of the lead parts.", "We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in?", "They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh.", "This really happened.", "We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, \"You OK with that?\" They said, \"Yeah, why?", "Was that wrong?\" They just switched.", "The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads.", "They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\" (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.", "If they don't know, they'll have a go.", "Am I right?", "They're not frightened of being wrong.", "I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.", "What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong.", "And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.", "They have become frightened of being wrong.", "And we run our companies like this.", "We stigmatize mistakes.", "And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make.", "And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.", "Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.", "The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.", "I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it.", "Or rather, we get educated out of it.", "So why is this?", "I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.", "In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.", "So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was.", "(Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born.", "Are you struck by a new thought?", "I was.", "You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?", "Do you?", "Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?", "Shakespeare being seven?", "I never thought of it.", "I mean, he was seven at some point.", "He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?", "(Laughter) How annoying would that be?", "(Laughter) \"Must try harder.\" (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\" To William Shakespeare.", "\"And put the pencil down!\" (Laughter) \"And stop speaking like that.\" (Laughter) \"It's confusing everybody.\" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition.", "Actually, my son didn't want to come.", "I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.", "He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.", "He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England.", "This was the love of his life, Sarah.", "He'd known her for a month.", "(Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16.", "He was really upset on the plane.", "He said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.", "(Laughter) But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.", "Every one.", "Doesn't matter where you go.", "You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't.", "At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities.", "At the bottom are the arts.", "Everywhere on earth.", "And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts.", "Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance.", "There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics.", "Why?", "Why not?", "I think this is rather important.", "I think math is very important, but so is dance.", "Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do.", "We all have bodies, don't we?", "Did I miss a meeting?", "(Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up.", "And then we focus on their heads.", "And slightly to one side.", "If you were to visit education as an alien and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors.", "Isn't it?", "They're the people who come out the top.", "And I used to be one, so there.", "(Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement.", "They're just a form of life.", "Another form of life.", "But they're rather curious.", "And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors.", "In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads.", "They live up there and slightly to one side.", "They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.", "They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.", "(Laughter) Don't they?", "It's a way of getting their head to meetings.", "(Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night.", "(Laughter) And there, you will see it.", "Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.", "(Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it.", "(Laughter) Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability.", "And there's a reason.", "Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century.", "They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism.", "So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.", "Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top.", "So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that.", "Is that right?", "\"Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.\" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.", "The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.", "And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image.", "If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance.", "And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized.", "And I think we can't afford to go on that way.", "In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history.", "More people.", "And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge

The manual explains that for each alien character in the note, you should write an indicated corresponding symbol. Following this chart, you write a response that you slip out the door. And for the next several days, this exchange continues. Outside the room, alien scientists are thrilled because they believe you’re conversing with them. But you still have no idea what these characters mean. This scenario isn’t just a bizarre misunderstanding— it’s a valuable thought experiment for understanding artificial intelligence. Philosopher John Searle developed the original version of this premise in 1980, as a response to some of the AI work being done at the time. But while modern AI models don't work like those outdated machines or the prisoner in Searle’s hypothetical, the question motivating his thought experiment is still relevant. To quote Searle, he wanted to interrogate whether an “appropriately programmed computer literally has cognitive states.” In other words, if a computer looks like it understands something, does that mean it actually understands the way a human does? Searle’s question falls into a long tradition of exploring whether or not AI could have a mind like ours. But answering these inquiries is incredibly difficult because, as philosophers and cognitive scientists will tell you, we still don’t know how our minds work. Even our fundamental definitions are slippery! Theorists generally agree that concepts like understanding, sentience, and consciousness are all different, but also that they’re related, and we don’t know how. Worse still, our usual scientific tools struggle to help us understand these experiences. Consider drinking a cup of coffee. Scientists can observe the physical process of ingesting the coffee, and we can measure the chemical impacts of caffeine on your body. These things are objective realities. But your collective sensation of smelling, sipping, evaluating, and experiencing a morning routine is more than the sum of its parts. This is consciousness— your subjective experience of being alive. And despite major leaps in psychology, cognitive science, and neurology, researchers still don’t know how various firing neurons bring about this experience. So if we can't define consciousness and understanding or identify what's uniquely human about them, how can we possibly test for these states in computers? Assessments like the Turing Test propose that if a human can't tell they're conversing with a computer, that computer could be seen as having some internal cognition. But this scenario is exactly what Searle was criticizing! This computer might just have the appearance of understanding. And just like cognitive scientists struggling to map consciousness onto brain activity, today’s AI researchers know how they trained their creations, but not how AIs reach their exact conclusions. There are some ways in which modern machine learning models are less mysterious than their predecessors. Approaches like neural networks and deep learning are designed to mimic known elements of human cognition. Like us, these models excel at pattern recognition— they learn by becoming familiar with information and forming connections across data sets. This kind of processing arguably approaches Searle’s definition of understanding— but it also reveals a bias in his original question. Since humans learn through pattern recognition and we believe ourselves to be conscious, we might also be predisposed to think other beings who learn the same way are somehow closer to consciousness as well. To combat this bias, some theorists have developed a different metric; specifically, that a fully conscious AI could draw connections beyond the information in its data set. For example, one lab’s “artificial consciousness test” probes AIs that have no data about consciousness for information they could only acquire from being conscious. This might involve asking an AI if it understands dreaming, or can report having had dreams itself. Can it understand a story about body swapping, where consciousnesses are shuffled between physical forms? It’s unclear when or if an AI will be able to understand us the way we understand each other.

in? - Rachel Marie E. Salas", "language": "en", "content": "In the 1970s, psychoanalyst Samuel Dunkell proposed a curious, albeit almost completely unsubstantiated, theory that the position you sleep in reflects your personality. For example, preferring to snooze in the so-called royal position indicated self-confidence, while sleeping semi-fetal meant you’re sensible and well adjusted. While Dunkell’s ideas lack any definitive proof, how we sleep can impact our health. So, what’s the best position to sleep in? Sleep positions go by countless creative names— the zombie, mountain climber, free faller, and soldier— yet sleep experts typically simplify them into four basic types: left side, right side, stomach, or back. Until the age of one, it is recommended that babies sleep on their backs to lower their risk of choking and suffocation. As young children, we start to move around more in our sleep, usually ending up on our sides and backs. And this tendency to avoid sleeping on our stomachs only grows with age. By adulthood, most people prefer side-sleeping, while fewer favor back-sleeping, and stomach-sleeping is the least preferred overall. But of course, individual sleep styles are highly personal: some people are sworn belly sleepers, while others can't nod off unless they're sprawled out on their backs. How we spend the night affects our bodies in several ways. Different sleep postures shift the relative positions of our internal organs, which can either relieve or worsen certain health issues. Others can leave the spine unsupported, straining nearby tissue, and preventing the muscles in the back, hips, or neck from fully relaxing. This can then lead to tension and stiffness in the morning. Take, for example, the least popular position: sleeping prone. Of the four, this also tends to be the least recommended by sleep experts, as it's thought to stretch the natural curvature of your spine. Yet there are unique situations when lying on your stomach may be beneficial. For patients with certain respiratory conditions, for example, it allows the back of the lungs to expand more freely. Sleeping on your back, on the other hand, is often preferred by those with lower back pain. When paired with a small pillow under the knees, this position allows the spine to maintain its natural curve. However, it may be less than ideal for your sleep partner. For some people, lying on their back can cause the soft tissues of the throat and tongue to collapse into the airway. Then, as the body tries to pull air through, these tissues vibrate, creating the sound we call snoring. This is also why people with sleep apnea are often told to avoid this position. This condition already involves pauses in breathing, and back sleeping can increase the likelihood that the airway collapses completely, blocking airflow. Today, most experts generally recommend side-sleeping, particularly when combined with a pillow between the knees, to better align the spine. But as it turns out, which side you lie on may make a difference. For example, studies show that sleeping on the left side often reduces heartburn symptoms for those with acid reflux. Your stomach is primarily located on the left side of your body, so this position situates it below the esophagus, allowing gravity to naturally keep stomach acid from flowing back up. However, for people with congestive heart failure, who often have an enlarged left ventricle, sleeping on the right side can help relieve chest pressure and improve their overall quality of sleep. Clearly, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. And attempting to reap the benefits of any one position can be tough, since most people shift positions 20 to 30 times per night without even knowing it. Pillows and other sleep training devices can help you stay in one place. But fortunately, unless you have a specific concern, sleep movement isn't always a bad thing. It's how your body naturally relieves pressure, responds to discomfort, and ultimately prevents injury. So, the next time you find yourself drifting to the free faller, soldier, or zombie, you can rest assured.", "sentences": ["In the 1970s, psychoanalyst Samuel Dunkell proposed a curious, albeit almost
