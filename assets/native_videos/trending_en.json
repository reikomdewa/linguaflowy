It's like a slider, where you can push it either towards form or towards function and it can be exciting when you push it way towards form. (moves into magnificent music) This is the iPhone Air. So Apple decided to make a ridiculously thin iPhone, yes. It's thinner than a number two pencil, thinner than any previous iPhone that's ever been made, including the one that bent. It's thinner than the freaking iPod Touch. That is ridiculous. And this isn't simply an iPhone shrunken down, Apple has done a ton of rearranging parts and pieces inside the phone. They've squeezed a lot of the compute and memory and logic board up into the top of the phone and allowed a bit of a bulge, which they're calling a plateau, which leaves most of the slimmer bottom of the phone for just battery. The edges are nice and softly rounded, and the whole outside frame is shiny titanium, which picks up a ton of fingerprints but also is remarkably durable. They 3D printed the USB type-C port to fit and all of the buttons and camera control, as thin as they are, go pretty much right up to the front and back edges of the phone. The end result is an iPhone that is noticeably thinner and lighter than it's been in a long time. It is super impressive, and importantly, deserving of the Air name. But it's not perfect. (chuckles) Of course, it's not perfect. You wouldn't be watching this review if it was that easy. There are a bunch of trade offs to making it this thin. It doesn't just get this thin magically without a bunch of sacrifices. Beauty is pain after all. And so now that I've been using this phone for a couple of weeks, I'm just gonna give you each of the trade offs that Apple made and how much you'll actually notice them. And I have some small concerns, some medium concerns, and then the big concerns. So small concern number one is they did remove the bottom speaker to achieve this. So most of the bottom of this phone is battery, but then those grills at the bottom of the Air are just for microphones. So the only speaker in this whole phone is up in that earpiece at the top. Couple things. A speaker that small is not going to get as loud, but there's also way less bass. So things are a bit tinny. But the worst case scenario is actually when you turn your phone landscape to watch a video or game or do something with stereo audio, in which case you'll probably notice all of the audio is coming from one side of the phone. And if you accidentally block that earpiece with your thumb, that's even more annoying. So the speakers are definitely not great, but they're acceptable for most everyday use. At least they're not horrible, you kind of just get used to it. So then the iPhone Air is eSIM only globally. This is, again, in an effort to make enough room for the battery, they're just getting rid of the slot where you normally have a little plastic SIM card. So this is a very direct trade off to get more battery out of that safe space. Apple won't say exactly how much battery they gained back, but some of the numbers I'm starting to see pop up around the eSIM versus non-eSIM iPhones, looks like there's around 200 milliamp hours of extra battery they're getting out of this. And believe me, I'll talk more about battery in a minute. But yeah, lots of people use regular SIM cards to this day. And I guess it's a bigger deal to me, because I swap phones a lot and there's lots of phones, from like Huawei and OPPO that I wouldn't be able to get my SIM card into and doesn't work well with eSIM, so I really dislike it. But I suppose for the average person, they'll only notice this once or twice. Once when they switch the phone, and then once when they move on to another phone. But speaking of carriers, the iPhone Air, unlike the rest of the iPhone 17s, does not support mmWave 5G. And the thing is, most people outside of the U.S. have never used mmWave 5G, and most people in the U.S. have also never used mmWave 5G. So you know it's super convenient once in a while. When you have it, you know, I found myself near a hotspot with a supporting device and if I happen to have something to download in that moment, it's great. But that is so rare and so far between that you might as well not worry about it yet. The modem in the iPhone Air is brand new. It's the new C1X chip and alongside Apple's new in-house designed N1 chip, which does all the networking, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6 and Thread, it's performed great. It does not seem to have any weaknesses in speed or coverage versus Qualcomm iPhones, previous iPhones with other modems, so that's been great to see. But then the USB-C port at the bottom of the Air is only USB2 transfer speeds. So, that's just dumb. But now let's get to the medium concerns. First of all, less cooling. Okay, so I did notice this phone getting hotter. It's running the more powerful A19 Pro chip with one less GPU core than the Pro phones, but it's a Pro chip and the Pro phones are way thicker and they're made of aluminum for better thermal conductivity and they have a new vapor chamber to draw heat away from that chip and dissipate it through the body. The Air has none of that. And so I did have a few instances, especially early on, where I was doing a lot of the sustained activity and the back of the phone was heating up a lot in my hands, especially like right below the camera plateau. No question, it's gotta be throttling down that chip with any sort of heavy, sustained use, it's a little concerning, but the phone never actually did overheat or give me an overheating message. So I guess that is a good thing. So then there is the single camera, and I'm putting this in medium concerns, but it really very much depends on the person. For some it's just like, \"Are you cool with this or not?\" Because a lot of people, a lot of people, are currently using iPhones that have more than one camera. Lots of older iPhones even have that useful Ultra Wide. And most of the people thinking about buying this Air have those second cameras, even third cameras. And so the Air doesn't have an Ultra Wide, and I can't tell you how many times I went to go take a picture of something and then realized I can't switch to the Ultra Wide. And there's also obviously no zoom as well. I will say Apple makes a big deal about their processing pipeline for the 2x crops on the Fusion camera. So the middle 12 megapixels for a 2x photo having a decent quality shot, but that still doesn't replace having an actual quality zoom camera. And that's especially noticeable when you try to zoom in, I'd say anywhere past about 5x, the quality really starts to drop off in all shooting scenarios. All that said, (shutter clicking) the one camera you do get is really good. It's essentially the same as the base iPhone 17, and in the world of a thousand dollars phones, it is right up there with the best. The selfie camera too, which I'll talk more about in the base iPhone 17 review, genuinely innovative and dramatically better than previous iPhones. I think casual photo and video takers will actually mostly be fine with this single camera solution in a vacuum, but we're not in a vacuum and there are other options out and you just have to know that there are other phones that cost a thousand dollars that have way more capable camera systems that can do zoom, that can do ultra wide, that can do macros. This won't do that. So for me, someone who relies on the cameras on the phone a lot, this is one of the reasons I'm not going to be switching to or dailying the Air, but for your parents or someone you know who takes most of their photos and videos on the main camera all the time anyway, they'll probably be totally fine with this, and this was a carefully considered cut from Apple to get there. But now my two main concerns with the iPhone Air, and probably for most people, the durability and the battery, and some of this is actually kind of shocking. It turns out the iPhone Air is not just a survivor of the famous JerryRigEverything bend test. It's literally one of the most impressively durable smartphones of all time. I'm not exaggerating, it's kind of ridiculous. I think in most people's concerns, when seeing a piece of hardware this thin, naturally they're thinking, \"Oh, am I gonna break this?\" \"Am I gonna snap it in half?\" And the answer it turns out pretty definitively is no, this is not any less durable than a normal smartphone. The titanium frame can withstand more bending than any human can put their mortal hands through, and it'll snap back to flat even if you do get it to flex. And you can almost undoubtedly sit on the phone for an extended period of time, like an insane person, and it will survive. It's still IP68 water and dust resistant, dunk it underwater if you want to. And the Ceramic Shield 2 on the front and back is actually even more scratch resistant than previous versions. I know they say that a lot. \"Oh this one's the most scratch resistant yet,\" but it's to the point where it didn't even show the normal scratches at level six with deeper grooves at level seven on Zach's famous test, it passed even beyond normal smartphones. Now of course, glass is glass and glass still breaks. You could still drop this phone and shatter the front or back glass, of course. But you know, I think we all went into this thinking that the durability would be a major weakness of this phone and it turns out it's one of the biggest strengths, which is crazy. Turns out those engineers and material science people over there are actually pretty good at what they're doing. Or maybe they had some incentive to not repeat a certain past incident. And then it also turns around and gets a 7 outta 10 from iFixit for repairability and still retains dual entry when you go in to repair it, so you can take just the front glass or just the back glass off and Apple posted all their disassembly guides on day one. Kudos. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that through all my throwing it in a frizzy bag and tossing it on a chair next to me, and all the abuse I've put this phone through, it hasn't even come close to breaking or bending. So that brings us to the last main concern, battery. So the battery on the iPhone Air is pretty weak and there's no getting around that. Remember earlier this year though, when I said one of the big pillars of 2025 smartphones was going to be these new, higher-density silicon carbon batteries? Well it turns out two of the biggest phone manufacturers out there, Samsung and Apple, well, they just didn't wanna take the dive on that quite yet on any of their phones. So not only is this phone thinner than ever, with less room inside for battery than ever, but it's also not even a special, high-density battery to make up for it. So the result is this big, bright, gorgeous six and a half inch, 120 hertz OLED display being powered by a battery the same size as the one in the iPhone 11. I will say parts have gotten more efficient, right? So like the display can throttle down all the way to one hertz and the A19 Pro chip can underclock super well. So it's not a disaster, but I'm giving the battery about a C minus. Ending the day with like 15% left in Low-Power Mode in normal use with four hours of screen on time for a brand new phone is not that great. Makes me concerned for how this will look in three or four years down the road. It's actually kind of similar to the camera situation. Like, there are lots of people who are now, today, it might be you, using a phone with a big battery that was awesome when you first got it. But now years later, if you're getting to the end of the day and it's dying and you realize you need a battery upgrade, the Air is probably not the phone you should be getting. But if you are getting to year three or four of your phone and the battery is not an issue and you feel like you're a pretty light user, then the Air could be fine for you. So to be specific, for my own use, like standby time I noticed was pretty good, like it is on so many other iPhones, but this Pro chip can spike up pretty quickly. So even with like some screen off stuff like wireless CarPlay for example, it would take big chunks outta my battery. Anytime the phone was doing anything heavy, battery beware. And then this phone also charges slower than the rest of the 17 lineup, which makes it even more annoying. So if you're a heavy user like me, well, you literally just end up keeping it on a wireless charger as much as possible. It's annoying, it was just very annoying to be honest. And that's sort of the two things that made it a deal breaker for me is the cameras and the battery. The difference though between those is the battery, you can kind of work around it, the camera, kind of can't. Also pretty classic Apple move to make the problem and then sell you the solution. So this is the MagSafe battery they launched alongside the Air. It's sold separately for a hundred bucks, and it's also just to be honest, not a very good accessory. It turns out it's basically the exact same battery that's in the iPhone Air, (graphics pop) but only charges it to about 65%, because of the heat loss during wireless charging. Not a great deal. So originally I said there were basically two ways to look at the iPhone Air. One is it's just Apple trying something new, throwing it out the wall to see if it sticks. Oh, maybe people like this or it is a long, premeditated preview at the future of all smartphones when they're all this thin. But I lied. There's actually a third way to look at this phone, and that is as one half of the upcoming foldable iPhone that we all expect as early as next year. Because it's easy to be impressed by the thinness of the iPhone Air, but if you've paid attention to the rest of the smartphone world lately, each half of a good folding phone is often even thinner than this iPhone. It's obviously a huge priority for them, because they're trying to get to the same thickness as a normal phone when closed, so double their typical Z axis. So all of this work, all of this incredible reorganization of the inside of the phone and the components and the miniaturization of parts and the efficiency maxing with their in-house developed parts like N1 chip and C1X, all of that effort is absolutely geared towards seeing if they can make the first ever, truly new form factor of an iPhone, maybe since the 10, one that folds in half. And it just so happens to enable this really thin form factor Air phone that they'll make in the meantime. Kind of the exact same way we got a Galaxy S25 Edge and then a few months later got the Z Fold 7, which was an ultra-thin foldable from Samsung. So I'm very much looking forward to that crazy foldable iPhone when it comes, and what they'll call it, and what software it'll run and all that other stuff. But for now, this one, yeah, it's an iPhone still. You know, every year we get the new iOS and all of its features and the clear theme and visual intelligence and all the iPhone stuff. And I review that separately and you guys already know about all that stuff. And then we get the new iPhones announcement, and there are almost zero new actual features here other than the selfie camera. But now it's like I'm reviewing, you know, the box that iOS comes in, you know? And I think this package, as cool as it is, like, this will speak to plenty of people. It's beautiful, it's super trim, it's super light in the hand, which is underrated. People are gonna pick this phone up and immediately love it. But I think maybe the best thing about the iPhone Air is actually how much it seems to have freed Apple up to make the Pro phones even more pro, which are now thicker and have more battery and heavier and bigger cameras and all unibody metal now. That's the one I'll be daily driving. Stay tuned for the full review, of course, on the Pro phones next. But hey, if you are planning on picking up an iPhone Air or literally any other iPhone or any Android phone for that matter, then channel sponsor Ridge has it covered. And I know Apple made their MagSafe wireless charger, but trust me, you'd rather have Ridge's wireless charger. Because this power bank is 10,000 milliamp hours. So that's good for about three full charges. Plus, it can actually do other things so it can charge your Apple Watch. It has two built in cables, USB type-C at 20 watts and Lightning for any legacy Apple devices. And it even has a kickstand built in to pop up your phone and watch videos while you're charging. It comes in Matte Black, Matte Olive, or Basecamp Orange to match your style. So whether you're upgrading to the iPhone Air or literally grabbed any other new phone that Ridge power bank has you covered. So check it out today at ridge.com/mkbhd for 10% off. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys to the next one. Peace.

almost undoubtedly sit on the phone for an extended period of time, like an insane person, and it will survive.", "It's still IP68 water and dust resistant, dunk it underwater if you want to.", "And the Ceramic Shield 2 on the front and back is actually even more scratch resistant than previous versions.", "I know they say that a lot.", "\"Oh this one's the most scratch resistant yet,\" but it's to the point where it didn't even show the normal scratches at level six with deeper grooves at level seven on Zach's famous test, it passed even beyond normal smartphones.", "Now of course, glass is glass and glass still breaks.", "You could still drop this phone and shatter the front or back glass, of course.", "But you know, I think we all went into this thinking that the durability would be a major weakness of this phone and it turns out it's one of the biggest strengths, which is crazy.", "Turns out those engineers and material science people over there are actually pretty good at what they're doing.", "Or maybe they had some incentive to not repeat a certain past incident.", "And then it also turns around and gets a 7 outta 10 from iFixit for repairability and still retains dual entry when you go in to repair it, so you can take just the front glass or just the back glass off and Apple posted all their disassembly guides on day one.", "Kudos.", "So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that through all my throwing it in a frizzy bag and tossing it on a chair next to me, and all the abuse I've put this phone through, it hasn't even come close to breaking or bending.", "So that brings us to the last main concern, battery.", "So the battery on the iPhone Air is pretty weak and there's no getting around that.", "Remember earlier this year though, when I said one of the big pillars of 2025 smartphones was going to be these new, higher-density silicon carbon batteries?", "Well it turns out two of the biggest phone manufacturers out there, Samsung and Apple, well, they just didn't wanna take the dive on that quite yet on any of their phones.", "So not only is this phone thinner than ever, with less room inside for battery than ever, but it's also not even a special, high-density battery to make up for it.", "So the result is this big, bright, gorgeous six and a half inch, 120 hertz OLED display being powered by a battery the same size as the one in the iPhone 11.", "I will say parts have gotten more efficient, right?", "So like the display can throttle down all the way to one hertz and the A19 Pro chip can underclock super well.", "So it's not a disaster, but I'm giving the battery about a C minus.", "Ending the day with like 15% left in Low-Power Mode in normal use with four hours of screen on time for a brand new phone is not that great.", "Makes me concerned for how this will look in three or four years down the road.", "It's actually kind of similar to the camera situation.", "Like, there are lots of people who are now, today, it might be you, using a phone with a big battery that was awesome when you first got it.", "But now years later, if you're getting to the end of the day and it's dying and you realize you need a battery upgrade, the Air is probably not the phone you should be getting.", "But if you are getting to year three or four of your phone and the battery is not an issue and you feel like you're a pretty light user, then the Air could be fine for you.", "So to be specific, for my own use, like standby time I noticed was pretty good, like it is on so many other iPhones, but this Pro chip can spike up pretty quickly.", "So even with like some screen off stuff like wireless CarPlay for example, it would take big chunks outta my battery.", "Anytime the phone was doing anything heavy, battery beware.", "And then this phone also charges slower than the rest of the 17 lineup, which makes it even more annoying.", "So if you're a heavy user like me, well, you literally just end up keeping it on a wireless charger as much as possible.", "It's annoying, it was just very annoying to be honest.", "And that's sort of the two things that made it a deal breaker for me is the cameras and the battery.", "The difference though between those is the battery, you can kind of work around it, the camera, kind of can't.", "Also pretty classic Apple move to make the problem and then sell you the solution.", "So this is the MagSafe battery they launched alongside the Air.", "It's sold separately for a hundred bucks, and it's also just to be honest, not a very good accessory.", "It turns out it's basically the exact same battery that's in the iPhone Air, (graphics pop) but only charges it to about 65%, because of the heat loss during wireless charging.", "Not a great deal.", "So originally I said there were basically two ways to look at the iPhone Air.", "One is it's just Apple trying something new, throwing it out the wall to see if it sticks.", "Oh, maybe people like this or it is a long, premeditated preview at the future of all smartphones when they're all this thin.", "But I lied.", "There's actually a third way to look at this phone, and that is as one half of the upcoming foldable iPhone that we all expect as early as next year.", "Because it's easy to be impressed by the thinness of the iPhone Air, but if you've paid attention to the rest of the smartphone world lately, each half of a good folding phone is often even thinner than this iPhone.", "It's obviously a huge priority for them, because they're trying to get to the same thickness as a normal phone when closed, so double their typical Z axis.", "So all of this work, all of this incredible reorganization of the inside of the phone and the components and the miniaturization of parts and the efficiency maxing with their in-house developed parts like N1 chip and C1X, all of that effort is absolutely geared towards seeing if they can make the first ever, truly new form factor of an iPhone, maybe since the 10, one that folds in half.", "And it just so happens to enable this really thin form factor Air phone that they'll make in the meantime.", "Kind of the exact same way we got a Galaxy S25 Edge and then a few months later got the Z Fold 7, which was an ultra-thin foldable from Samsung.", "So I'm very much looking forward to that crazy foldable iPhone when it comes, and what they'll call it, and what software it'll run and all that other stuff.", "But for now, this one, yeah, it's an iPhone still.", "You know, every year we get the new iOS and all of its features and the clear theme and visual intelligence and all the iPhone stuff.", "And I review that separately and you guys already know about all that stuff.", "And then we get the new iPhones announcement, and there are almost zero new actual features here other than the selfie camera.", "But now it's like I'm reviewing, you know, the box that iOS comes in, you know?", "And I think this package, as cool as it is, like, this will speak to plenty of people.", "It's beautiful, it's super trim, it's super light in the hand, which is underrated.", "People are gonna pick this phone up and immediately love it.", "But I think maybe the best thing about the iPhone Air is actually how much it seems to have freed Apple up to make the Pro phones even more pro, which are now thicker and have more battery and heavier and bigger cameras and all unibody metal now.", "That's the one I'll be daily driving.", "Stay tuned for the full review, of course, on the Pro phones next.", "But hey, if you are planning on picking up an iPhone Air or literally any other iPhone or any Android phone for that matter, then channel sponsor Ridge has it covered.", "And I know Apple made their MagSafe wireless charger, but trust me, you'd rather have Ridge's wireless charger.", "Because this power bank is 10,000 milliamp hours.", "So that's good for about three full charges.", "Plus, it can actually do other things so it can charge your Apple Watch.", "It has two built in cables, USB type-C at 20 watts and Lightning for any legacy Apple devices.", "And it even has a kickstand built in to pop up your phone and watch videos while you're charging.", "It comes in Matte Black, Matte Olive, or Basecamp Orange to match your style.", "So whether you're upgrading to the iPhone Air or literally grabbed any other new phone that Ridge power bank has you covered.", "So check it out today at ridge.com/mkbhd for 10% off.", "Thanks for watching.", "Catch you guys to the next one.", "Peace.", "(no audio)"], "transcript": [{"start": 0.9,

And it's another AI in a box, and it's a sign of the times. So this thing here, it has a lot in common with the Humane Ai Pin, for better or for worse. But it's also supposed to have two specific things that are supposed to set it apart from that. Supposed to, anyway. And we have to talk about it. (letters clicking) (tense music) So, stop me if this sounds familiar at any point, but check this out. This is a virtual assistant in a box. But it's a different box. This one is not wearable. It's a thing you have to carry around with you in your pocket, like a smartphone. I'd say it's about the size of a stack of Post-its, maybe. But it's this lightweight plastic cube, designed by Teenage Engineering. And boy, do people love some Teenage Engineering right now. And it's super... I mean, you can tell exactly what it is from a mile away. This thing is very recognizable. The thing has one button on the right side. That's the one you press and hold to ask it questions. And then instead of a projector, it actually does have a built-in screen here. And instead of built-in cellular, it has a SIM card tray right alongside that USB Type-C port for charging. I'd say it does seem to send basically every single request to the Cloud, but I will say, it does feel significantly quicker to answer questions than the Humane Ai Pin. Now, that is a very, very low bar to clear, but it's consistent, it's consistently quicker. How far away is the moon? - [AI Voice] The average distance between Earth and the Moon is approximately 384,400 kilometers. - You can connect headphones via Bluetooth, or turn the built-in speaker all the way up, like I have. But it also shows you the text of your answer on the screen, right underneath this bouncing rabbit, and the time in the battery. Matter of fact, it basically always shows this bouncing rabbit all the time. It's how you know it's awake. You hit that button once to put it to sleep. Or it would do that automatically after a few seconds. Then hit the button again to wake it up. Boom, just the rabbit waiting for you there. And then to get to settings, there's no button to press for that. There's no gesture on the screen or anything. You just shake it like an Etch A Sketch. And as long as you do that, then from there you can scroll up and down with this scroll wheel, and select with the button. That's how you get around the UI. So, the other two things it has are the scroll wheel and a swiveling camera. So the scroll wheel for navigating around the UI instead of the screen is... I'll get to why it's odd in a second. But then of course, the AI assistant is multimodal, and so you can use vision to answer questions about what it sees. So we've seen this before. With this one, you double-tap to swivel it open, and then press and hold to ask. I don't know. What type of plant is this? - [AI Voice] Taking a look now. The plant in the image appears to be a Monstera deliciosa, also known as a Swiss cheese plant. This is a type of tropical climbing evergreen plant native to southern Mexico and parts of Central America. The large glossy green leaves with distinctive- - As a reviewer testing this thing, I just feel like that DJ Khaled clip after a while, where I'm just pointing at stuff, like, \"Okay, what is this? And what is this?\" - And what is this? - [Speaker] Those are pickled banana peppers. - [DJ Khaled] And what is this? - [Speaker] Berries and seeds. - [DJ Khaled] And perhaps what is this? - [Speaker] Water. - But I've also, I've just pointed it at my computer screen with a really long email on it, and asked it for a summary, and it just reads an instantly and gives me a summary of it. It's done that with articles too. I think that's pretty cool. But yeah, it's just a... It's an AI in a box. It's best at just answering questions. (text clicking) (soft music) So yeah, this thing is also bad at a lot of stuff. And this list is gonna sound pretty familiar. Somehow, the battery life is just as bad as the Humane Pin. It has a thousand million power battery inside and it's brutally bad. Like it's already bad enough when you're carrying around a whole nother device alongside your smartphone, but when this one can sit in front of you doing nothing, and the battery just visibly is draining and dies in like four hours... Then you have to charge it multiple times per day, and it's still dead when you wake up in the morning. Like, it's just exhausting. Also, it took 45 minutes to charge this tiny battery from zero to a hundred. And it's also just straight up missing a ton of what I would consider just basic features. Like it can't set alarms, can't set timers, it can't record videos, can't record photos, can't send emails, there's no calendar built in. There's just a lot of things that I would want an assistant to do... Not here. And of course, being an AI assistant, it also does still hallucinate, and confidently answer questions wrong. Like my baseline of asking a question that I know the answer to, and then getting the wrong answer happens all the time. Which is one of the downfalls of this category. So this device was designed by Teenage Engineering. And they're really leaning into that. Like that's why... I mean, it's this bright orange, it is really quirky, friendly looking device, I would say, intentionally. But yeah, they really love their analog controls. And this scroll wheel here doesn't surprise me, but it's actually really frustrating to use. First of all, it protrudes out the back a little bit, as you can see. Which looks kinda cool. But that means if it was really sensitive, that it would actually scroll if you just put it down on a table or something. So they've dialed down the sensitivity of the scroll wheel, so it's actually super slow. Like there's a surprising amount of scroll motion required to go down one line in the settings. And then there's no haptic feedback here as you're scrolling to help you feel it out. So fine, okay, you can get used to that. You use the button to select... But then you've also noticed, there's no back button anywhere on this device. So to go back up a level, you have to scroll all the way back up to the top every single time. That also gets annoying. And then to change brightness or volume, you actually need two hands. So you just go into brightness to select, and you hold the button with one hand, and then scroll the scroll wheel with the other hand to adjust brightness. Which, yeah, you can't do it with one hand. It works, so you can learn it, and you can say, you know, it's this quirky UI it's got going on. But I feel like a lot of these problems would be solved if this was a touch screen. So what if I told you this is a touch screen, and they just don't really let you use it for almost anything? Like moving through these menus would be easier if I could just tap what I wanted to, right? Going back after a long scroll would be easier if I could just flip scroll back to the top of a list, and hit back. But you can't. The only thing you can use the touchscreen for is basically typing on the keyboard in terminal mode. So with terminal enabled, you can turn it sideways, a keyboard pops up, and you can type your questions and get text answers. Which is great. And you can move between letters with the scroll wheel. It's kind of a neat feature, I guess. But why can't we use the touch screen for anything else? Is it just them trying not to look too much like a smartphone? Maybe. Probably. (text clicking) (tense music) So, okay, what's the point? Why does this thing exist? If it's so similar to the other one that was also so bad, what are we doing here? And really, there's two things that I think they're hoping will be the things that set it apart from the other one. That should, in the words of their co-founder, Jesse... - But I don't think MKBHD will say this is the worst device he ever reviewed so far. (people laughing) - Which, low bar, but okay. Those two things are the price tag, and the large action model. So the Humane Pin was so easy for everyone to dunk on because it costs as much as a phone. It was $700 with a $24 a month subscription to not turn into a brick. It's just insane. So, this one right here costs $200 and no subscription. So, you know, okay, that hits a little different. But also, you can tell it's $200. First of all, you will need a separate SIM card to get it to work on cellular. So while there is no subscription fee for Rabbit to keep the device working, that is still a fee you're gonna pay every month to get data outside of wifi. But then, okay, the unboxing experience is extremely minimal. It comes in a single cardboard box with a cassette tape looking plastic container, that doubles as a stand, but there's literally nothing else. No charging brick, no USB-C cable, no stickers, no paper instruction manual, nothing at all. And then the R1 itself is made of plastic. Not to say that it's not built well. You know, there's no flexing or creaking or anything like that. But it's definitely plastic. The camera, very basic. The speaker, very cheap. You know, it's a low end MediaTek chip inside. The same one that's in the Moto G8 Power Lite, which is like $150 phone. Hardly any battery, as we learned. And no fancy fast charging or wireless charging. And it comes in one color, really bright orange. Like this ridiculously saturated bright orange. I'm not even joking, the color you're seeing in this YouTube video on your screen, it's gonna be the best I can do with my own color correction. But it's legitimately hard to photograph. Like the phone camera doesn't really turn saturation up high enough to really represent it accurately in real life. It's the brightest orange thing you've ever seen in your life, I guarantee it. Now, if you want something a little more low key than the neon orange, channel sponsor dbrand actually does have you covered here. I've got this black camo looking one here, and now the orange bits that show through are kind of like more accent pieces, which is pretty dope. But fun fact, dbrand also collaborated with Rabbit ahead of the release to make sure screen protectors for this thing were also available on launch day. So, that includes mine. If you wanna check it out, screen protectors or skins for the R1, you can hit up the link below. But yes, speaking of the screen, this is a 2.9 inch diagonal TFT screen, with no auto brightness. So, yeah, I think you get the idea. (letters clicking) (soft music) So you know how the Humane Ai Pin had no apps? Well, this thing also has no apps. But the other thing that they're hoping will separate it from the other stuff, is what they're calling a large action model. So you know, large language models are just the words, the language that we use. So it's an AI that can take our natural language, and process it, and turn it into words in return. And that's how we interact with it. So a large action model is supposed to take our words, and then process it, and turn it into actions. That's the theory. So it's basically going to be able to use apps for you like a human would, based on what you tell it to do. Now, importantly, this isn't the same as an API, where you know, a company might work with the others to have some sort of a plug into their services so that they work together. Because an API can be a little too restrictive, or not give all the features, or just not quite... I mean, there's lots of good reasons why they don't wanna rely on an API. So what this is supposed to be doing, is just going in and using the app, just like a human, essentially with like a mouse and a keyboard. Think of it as like a virtual agent. Honestly, I think it's a really cool idea. I think it's a really, really cool idea. You know, large language models have been trained, with all their data, to talk back to us just like humans would, and some are very convincing. So a large action model, in theory, should be able to use these apps and services just like a human would. From Spotify to Twitter, to your banking app, to whatever else. It's already good enough at recognizing major UI elements like a play button or a buy button and things like that. So with enough training data, could get really good. With enough training data, could get really good. But the thing is, they don't have a ton of training data yet. So as of right now, they have made four apps available. Four. They have this online portal called the Rabbit Hole, where you can log into and enable all of them. Spotify, Uber, DoorDash and Midjourney. So the Rabbit can talk to these four apps, and has a UI on the screen for doing so in the exact way that we're theorizing. So it'll play Spotify songs. Like I can ask it for a song, and it'll try to play the right one, and it'll show you any info you need on the touch screen to confirm or refine the actions you're taking. But even now, they kinda work. Like, I've already had issues with it playing the wrong song. I've also seen other people already have issues with the DoorDash app getting things wrong, which is even more frustrating. I can't imagine how frustrating the Uber app messing up would be. It definitely seems like it needs more training data. And that's just for these four starting apps. Now, Rabbit says they have 800 different apps trained already, but they just haven't built a UI for it yet, so it's not available on the Rabbit yet. And so that's still in the works. Now they've also theoretically started working on something called a generative UI, where essentially it can recognize what type of app it is, and then build a UI for it so Rabbit doesn't have to... But that's also still theoretical, and also on the roadmap and still in the works. And then if there's another app or service that you want your Rabbit to be able to do, like something for work, or something super niche that you've invented, they've talked about something called \"Teach Mode\". Which is basically having the Rabbit watch you do what you want it to do on your mouse and keyboard, and then it learns from what you did, and can then repeat your actions later, which is sick. Unfortunately, you can probably already see where this is going, Teach Mode is also not available as of right now. This is something they're still working on vetting and finishing. And so that's just later this year, also in the works. So as of right now, this device has none of that stuff, just the four kind of half working apps that we went over at the beginning. What are we doing here? (letters clicking) (soft music) Okay, I'm gonna try not to turn this into a rant, but I feel like we need to acknowledge at least, that a lot of these tech companies are developing tech kinda backwards. Like they're delivering such unfinished products, that it actually makes them nearly impossible to review. Like, it feels like it used to just be, make the thing, and then put it on sale. Now it's like put it on sale, and then deliver the half-baked thing, and then iterate and make it better, and hopefully with enough updates, then it's ready, and it's what we promised way back when we first started selling it. And then this whole period in the middle is a mess. And it's across all kinds of product categories too. We've seen this with gaming. Like huge studios are delivering half-baked games saying, \"Oh, you know, it's an alpha version. There will be updates.\" But meanwhile, it's a full price AAA game that's just gotten an unacceptable number of bugs and issues. It's also happening with cars. And vehicles getting announced, and then delivering with like a half-finished state, where you just don't get a lot of the features that you paid for. And they're eventually coming soon, with a software update. You know, smartphones, obviously, we've been seeing this for years, but it does seem like now more than ever, there's at least one feature, one major feature of every smartphone launch that gets announced, but that's not coming until later in the year. And now these AI based products are at like the apex of this horrible trend where, the thing that you get at the beginning is like borderline nonfunctional compared to all the promises and all the features and all the things that it's supposed to maybe someday be. But you still pay full price at the beginning, which is what makes it so crazy. And that sucks not only obviously for the people buying it at full price at the beginning, but also for reviewing these things in general. Like, how do you assess a product where the version of what's promised in like three years, what it could be is amazing, but the version that's being delivered now is dog water. Like, how do you connect those dots? Do you even connect those dots? Are you supposed to give them the benefit of the doubt? I don't know. What are we even doing here? I mean, I guess on one hand, it is good that tech products, these things can get better over time and improve, and the thing you buy can be better tomorrow. That's all great. That didn't used to be true, and that's beautiful and everything. But on the other hand, it's just, the other side of that coin, is some very unfinished products being delivered, and I just feel like it's gonna get worse before it gets better. (letters clicking) (tense music) So, let me just say, I am personally very excited by the idea of a super personalized AI assistant that can do everything that a human assistant could. That's my dream. I want that to happen. And I'm interested that these different companies are approaching it from different angles. And hopefully, we'll get there eventually. But this is also so clearly going to take a lot of time and effort and technical development, and also a lot of data. Like, I've said this already in the Humane review, I'm pretty sure, which is a good assistant needs to know everything about you, whether it's human or virtual. Like it needs to know your preferences, and your location, and what you're doing, and what you like to do. And every single little thing. It's so much data. So as for the Rabbit... I think that's why they focused on getting the price so low. Like, this stuff is all a tough sell, because you're taking a gamble on what the product could be someday. But for the Pin, you have to drop $700, and $24 every month, on the chance that it might someday get there. Like that's a lot of money. But for this cute little thing, 200 bucks. Feels like a much easier investment to make. A much easier pill to swallow, to just take a gamble on it. And on the off chance it turns out to be awesome in a couple of years, it'll feel like it's worth it. You know, on the chance that some of those 800 apps are super useful. Or you know, even though you already have a smartphone, maybe the Teach Mode lets it do something with a single button press that you could never dream of before, then it could be totally worth it. The whole situation reminds me kind of... If you look back at the beginning of when Tesla started shipping cars with all the autopilot stuff. They were selling cars, and they got popular for other reasons. It was a good electric car with good range, and a good charging network. And then people started sort of beta testing this autopilot stuff, and Tesla starts collecting millions of miles and hours of data, from how it works in the real world. And so all of that data helped their systems learn, and get the head start that they need, on trying to make the best autopilot software. So the Rabbit, I'm sure, would like to use their price advantage, and get as many of them out into the real world as possible, into people's hands, so they can start beta testing, and having it trained and getting good at a variety of tasks. But the Rabbit's problem is, it doesn't have like the other reason why people would get it anyway today. So it's like a kind of chicken and egg problem. So if you want my advice, you've heard it before. Buy the product based on what it is today, and not what it's promised to be in the future. And with this category, that's like the hardest thing to do, the hardest thing to keep in mind. 'Cause the promise is so big. But that's still my advice. And I guess we still also have yet to see what big companies like Google and Apple are gonna try to do in this space, probably this year. So, with all of that, we'll see. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.

pretty cool.", "But yeah, it's just a...", "It's an AI in a box.", "It's best at just answering questions.", "(text clicking) (soft music) So yeah, this thing is also bad at a lot of stuff.", "And this list is gonna sound pretty familiar.", "Somehow, the battery life is just as bad as the Humane Pin.", "It has a thousand million power battery inside and it's brutally bad.", "Like it's already bad enough when you're carrying around a whole nother device alongside your smartphone, but when this one can sit in front of you doing nothing, and the battery just visibly is draining and dies in like four hours...", "Then you have to charge it multiple times per day, and it's still dead when you wake up in the morning.", "Like, it's just exhausting.", "Also, it took 45 minutes to charge this tiny battery from zero to a hundred.", "And it's also just straight up missing a ton of what I would consider just basic features.", "Like it can't set alarms, can't set timers, it can't record videos, can't record photos, can't send emails, there's no calendar built in.", "There's just a lot of things that I would want an assistant to do...", "Not here.", "And of course, being an AI assistant, it also does still hallucinate, and confidently answer questions wrong.", "Like my baseline of asking a question that I know the answer to, and then getting the wrong answer happens all the time.", "Which is one of the downfalls of this category.", "So this device was designed by Teenage Engineering.", "And they're really leaning into that.", "Like that's why...", "I mean, it's this bright orange, it is really quirky, friendly looking device, I would say, intentionally.", "But yeah, they really love their analog controls.", "And this scroll wheel here doesn't surprise me, but it's actually really frustrating to use.", "First of all, it protrudes out the back a little bit, as you can see.", "Which looks kinda cool.", "But that means if it was really sensitive, that it would actually scroll if you just put it down on a table or something.", "So they've dialed down the sensitivity of the scroll wheel, so it's actually super slow.", "Like there's a surprising amount of scroll motion required to go down one line in the settings.", "And then there's no haptic feedback here as you're scrolling to help you feel it out.", "So fine, okay, you can get used to that.", "You use the button to select...", "But then you've also noticed, there's no back button anywhere on this device.", "So to go back up a level, you have to scroll all the way back up to the top every single time.", "That also gets annoying.", "And then to change brightness or volume, you actually need two hands.", "So you just go into brightness to select, and you hold the button with one hand, and then scroll the scroll wheel with the other hand to adjust brightness.", "Which, yeah, you can't do it with one hand.", "It works, so you can learn it, and you can say, you know, it's this quirky UI it's got going on.", "But I feel like a lot of these problems would be solved if this was a touch screen.", "So what if I told you this is a touch screen, and they just don't really let you use it for almost anything?", "Like moving through these menus would be easier if I could just tap what I wanted to, right?", "Going back after a long scroll would be easier if I could just flip scroll back to the top of a list, and hit back.", "But you can't.", "The only thing you can use the touchscreen for is basically typing on the keyboard in terminal mode.", "So with terminal enabled, you can turn it sideways, a keyboard pops up, and you can type your questions and get text answers.", "Which is great.", "And you can move between letters with the scroll wheel.", "It's kind of a neat feature, I guess.", "But why can't we use the touch screen for anything else?", "Is it just them trying not to look too much like a smartphone?", "Maybe.", "Probably.", "(text clicking) (tense music) So, okay, what's the point?", "Why does this thing exist?", "If it's so similar to the other one that was also so bad, what are we doing here?", "And really, there's two things that I think they're hoping will be the things that set it apart from the other one.", "That should, in the words of their co-founder, Jesse...", "- But I don't think MKBHD will say this is the worst device he ever reviewed so far.", "(people laughing) - Which, low bar, but okay.", "Those two things are the price tag, and the large action model.", "So the Humane Pin was so easy for everyone to dunk on because it costs as much as a phone.", "It was $700 with a $24 a month subscription to not turn into a brick.", "It's just insane.", "So, this one right here costs $200 and no subscription.", "So, you know, okay, that hits a little different.", "But also, you can tell it's $200.", "First of all, you will need a separate SIM card to get it to work on cellular.", "So while there is no subscription fee for Rabbit to keep the device working, that is still a fee you're gonna pay every month to get data outside of wifi.", "But then, okay, the unboxing experience is extremely minimal.", "It comes in a single cardboard box with a cassette tape looking plastic container, that doubles as a stand, but there's literally nothing else.", "No charging brick, no USB-C cable, no stickers, no paper instruction manual, nothing at all.", "And then the R1 itself is made of plastic.", "Not to say that it's not built well.", "You know, there's no flexing or creaking or anything like that.", "But it's definitely plastic.", "The camera, very basic.", "The speaker, very cheap.", "You know, it's a low end MediaTek chip inside.", "The same one that's in the Moto G8 Power Lite, which is like $150 phone.", "Hardly any battery, as we learned.", "And no fancy fast charging or wireless charging.", "And it comes in one color, really bright orange.", "Like this ridiculously saturated bright orange.", "I'm not even joking, the color you're seeing in this YouTube video on your screen, it's gonna be the best I can do with my own color correction.", "But it's legitimately hard to photograph.", "Like the phone camera doesn't really turn saturation up high enough to really represent it accurately in real life.", "It's the brightest orange thing you've ever seen in your life, I guarantee it.", "Now, if you want something a little more low key than the neon orange, channel sponsor dbrand actually does have you covered here.", "I've got this black camo looking one here, and now the orange bits that show through are kind of like more accent pieces, which is pretty dope.", "But fun fact, dbrand also collaborated with Rabbit ahead of the release to make sure screen protectors for this thing were also available on launch day.", "So, that includes mine.", "If you wanna check it out, screen protectors or skins for the R1, you can hit up the link below.", "But yes, speaking of the screen, this is a 2.9 inch diagonal TFT screen, with no auto brightness.", "So, yeah, I think you get the idea.", "(letters clicking) (soft music) So you know how the Humane Ai Pin had no apps?", "Well, this thing also has no apps.", "But the other thing that they're hoping will separate it from the other stuff, is what they're calling a large action model.", "So you know, large language models are just the words, the language that we use.", "So it's an AI that can take our natural language, and process it, and turn it into words in return.", "And that's how we interact with it.", "So a large action model is supposed to take our words, and then process it, and turn it into actions.", "That's the theory.", "So it's basically going to be able to use apps for you like a human would, based on what you tell it to do.", "Now, importantly, this isn't the same as an API, where you know, a company might work with the others to have some sort of a plug into their services so that they work together.", "Because an API can be a little too restrictive, or not give all the features, or just not quite...", "I mean, there's lots of good reasons why they don't wanna rely on an API.", "So what this is supposed to be doing, is just going in and using the app, just like a human, essentially with like a mouse and a keyboard.", "Think of it as like a virtual agent.", "Honestly, I think it's a really cool idea.", "I think it's a really, really cool idea.", "You know, large language models have been trained, with all their data, to talk back to us just like humans would, and some are very convincing.", "So a large action model, in theory, should be able to use these apps and services just like a human would.", "From Spotify to Twitter, to your banking app, to whatever else.", "It's already good enough at recognizing major UI elements like a play button or a buy button and things like that.", "So with enough training data, could get really good.", "With enough training data, could get really good.", "But the thing is, they don't have a ton of training data yet.", "So as of right now, they have made four apps available.", "Four.", "They have this online portal called the Rabbit Hole, where you can log into and enable all of them.", "Spotify, Uber, DoorDash and Midjourney.", "So the Rabbit can talk to these four apps, and has a UI on the screen for doing so in the exact way that we're theorizing.", "So it'll play Spotify songs.", "Like I can ask it for a song, and it'll try to play the right one, and it'll show you any info you need on the touch screen to confirm or refine the actions you're taking.", "But even now, they kinda work.", "Like, I've already had issues with it playing the wrong song.", "I've also seen other people already have issues with the DoorDash app getting things wrong, which is even more frustrating.", "I can't imagine how frustrating the Uber app messing up would be.", "It definitely seems like it needs more training data.", "And that's just for these four starting apps.", "Now, Rabbit says they have 800 different apps trained already, but they just haven't built a UI for it yet, so it's not available on the Rabbit yet.", "And so that's still in the works.", "Now they've also theoretically started working on something called a generative UI, where essentially it can recognize what type of app it is, and then build a UI for it so Rabbit doesn't have to...", "But that's also still theoretical, and also on the roadmap and still in the works.", "And then if there's another app or service that you want your Rabbit to be able to do, like something for work, or something super niche that you've invented, they've talked about something called \"Teach Mode\".", "Which is basically having the Rabbit watch you do what you want it to do on your mouse and keyboard, and then it learns from what you did, and can then repeat your actions later, which is sick.", "Unfortunately, you can probably already see where this is going, Teach Mode is also not available as of right now.", "This is something they're still working on vetting and finishing.", "And so that's just later this year, also in the works.", "So as of right now, this device has none of that stuff, just the four kind of half working apps that we went over at the beginning.", "What are we doing here?", "(letters clicking) (soft music) Okay, I'm gonna try not to turn this into a rant, but I feel like we need to acknowledge at least, that a lot of these tech companies are developing tech kinda backwards.", "Like they're delivering such unfinished products, that it actually makes them nearly impossible to review.", "Like, it feels like it used to just be, make the thing, and then put it on sale.", "Now it's like put it on sale, and then deliver the half-baked thing, and then iterate and make it better, and hopefully with enough updates, then it's ready, and it's what we promised way back when we first started selling it.", "And then this whole period in the middle is a mess.", "And it's across all kinds of product categories too.", "We've seen this with gaming.", "Like huge studios are delivering half-baked games saying, \"Oh, you know, it's an alpha version.", "There will be updates.\" But meanwhile, it's a full price AAA game that's just gotten an unacceptable number of bugs and issues.", "It's also happening with cars.", "And vehicles getting announced, and then delivering with like a half-finished state, where you just don't get a lot of the features that you paid for.", "And they're eventually coming soon, with a software update.", "You know, smartphones, obviously, we've been seeing this for years, but it does seem like now more than ever, there's at least one feature, one major feature of every smartphone launch that gets announced, but that's not coming until later in the year.", "And now these AI based products are at like the apex of this horrible trend where, the thing that you get at the beginning is like borderline nonfunctional compared to all the promises and all the features and all the things that it's supposed to maybe someday be.", "But you still pay full price at the beginning, which is what makes it so crazy.", "And that sucks not only obviously for the people buying it at full price at the beginning, but also for reviewing these things in general.", "Like, how do you assess a product where the version of what's promised in like three years, what it could be is amazing, but the version that's being delivered now is dog water.", "Like, how do you connect those dots?", "Do you even connect those dots?", "Are you supposed to give them the benefit of the doubt?", "I don't know.", "What are we even doing here?", "I mean, I guess on one hand, it is good that tech products, these things can get better over time and improve, and the thing you buy can be better tomorrow.", "That's all great.", "That didn't used to be true, and that's beautiful and everything.", "But on the other hand, it's just, the other side of that coin, is some very unfinished products being delivered, and I just feel like it's gonna get worse before it gets better.", "(letters clicking) (tense music) So, let me just say, I am personally very excited by the idea of a super personalized AI assistant that can do everything that a human assistant could.", "That's my dream.", "I want that to happen.", "And I'm interested that these different companies are approaching it from different angles.", "And hopefully, we'll get there eventually.", "But this is also so clearly going to take a lot of time and effort and technical development, and also a lot of data.", "Like, I've said this already in the Humane review, I'm pretty sure, which is a good assistant needs to know everything about you, whether it's human or virtual.", "Like it needs to know your preferences, and your location, and what you're doing, and what you like to do.", "And every single little thing.", "It's so much data.", "So as for the Rabbit...", "I think that's why they focused on getting the price so low.", "Like, this stuff is all a tough sell, because you're taking a gamble on what the product could be someday.", "But for the Pin, you have to drop $700, and $24 every month, on the chance that it might someday get there.", "Like that's a lot of money.", "But for this cute little thing, 200 bucks.", "Feels like a much easier investment to make.", "A much easier pill to swallow, to just take a gamble on it.", "And on the off chance it turns out to be awesome in a couple of years, it'll feel like it's worth it.", "You know, on the chance that some of those 800 apps are super useful.", "Or you know, even though you already have a smartphone, maybe the Teach Mode lets it do something with a single button press that you could never dream of before, then it could be totally worth it.", "The whole situation reminds me kind of...", "If you look back at the beginning of when Tesla started shipping cars with all the autopilot stuff.", "They were selling cars, and they got popular for other reasons.", "It was a good electric car with good range, and a good charging network.", "And then people started sort of beta testing this autopilot stuff, and Tesla starts collecting millions of miles and hours of data, from how it works in the real world.", "And so all of that data helped their systems learn, and get the head start that they need, on trying to make the best autopilot software.", "So the Rabbit, I'm sure, would like to use their price advantage, and get as many of them out into the real world as possible, into people's hands, so they can start beta testing, and having it trained and getting good at a variety of tasks.", "But the Rabbit's problem is, it doesn't have like the other reason why people would get it anyway today.", "So it's like a kind of chicken and egg problem.", "So if you want my advice, you've heard it before.", "Buy the product based on what it is today, and not what it's promised to be in the future.", "And with this category, that's like the hardest thing to do, the hardest thing to keep in mind.", "'Cause the promise is so big.", "But that's still my advice.", "And I guess we still also have yet to see what big companies like Google and Apple are gonna try to do in this space, probably this year.", "So, with all of that, we'll see.", "Thanks for watching.", "Catch you in the next one.", "Peace.", "(mellow

Galaxy Z Trifold. A phone that folds out not once Trifold. A phone that folds out not once Trifold. A phone that folds out not once but twice to reveal a 10in [music] but twice to reveal a 10in [music] but twice to reveal a 10in [music] tablet display on the inside. And I've tablet display on the inside. And I've tablet display on the inside. And I've ended up wanting one, a lot more than I ended up wanting one, a lot more than I ended up wanting one, a lot more than I expected to because of what they've done expected to because of what they've done expected to because of what they've done with all of that screen. So, the Trifold with all of that screen. So, the Trifold with all of that screen. So, the Trifold ships in a pretty massive box by today's ships in a pretty massive box by today's ships in a pretty massive box by today's standards. Samsung did this with their standards. Samsung did this with their standards. Samsung did this with their very first Galaxy Fold 2. I guess it's very first Galaxy Fold 2. I guess it's very first Galaxy Fold 2. I guess it's their way of rewarding the early their way of rewarding the early their way of rewarding the early adopters. The first thing inside is this adopters. The first thing inside is this adopters. The first thing inside is this insert, which has three things. a SIM insert, which has three things. a SIM insert, which has three things. a SIM ejector up here, a USBC to C cable, and ejector up here, a USBC to C cable, and ejector up here, a USBC to C cable, and then a case, which, as you can tell, is then a case, which, as you can tell, is then a case, which, as you can tell, is pretty skimpy. It's not going to cover pretty skimpy. It's not going to cover pretty skimpy. It's not going to cover up a lot of the phone, but I think it's up a lot of the phone, but I think it's up a lot of the phone, but I think it's pretty well designed with this extra lip pretty well designed with this extra lip pretty well designed with this extra lip that [music] acts a bit like the spine that [music] acts a bit like the spine that [music] acts a bit like the spine of a book covering up the hinge when the of a book covering up the hinge when the of a book covering up the hinge when the phone is closed. Then there's the phone is closed. Then there's the phone is closed. Then there's the trifold itself. And interestingly, trifold itself. And interestingly, trifold itself. And interestingly, underneath that, a 45W charger, too. Not underneath that, a 45W charger, too. Not underneath that, a 45W charger, too. Not quite sure how that lines up with not quite sure how that lines up with not quite sure how that lines up with not including the charger on every other including the charger on every other including the charger on every other phone for eco reasons, but I'm happy to phone for eco reasons, but I'm happy to phone for eco reasons, but I'm happy to see it here. I don't think it's a safe see it here. I don't think it's a safe see it here. I don't think it's a safe assumption that people just have these assumption that people just have these assumption that people just have these 45 watt bricks lying around. So, this is what the Galaxy Z Trifold So, this is what the Galaxy Z Trifold So, this is what the Galaxy Z Trifold looks like from the front. It's actually looks like from the front. It's actually looks like from the front. It's actually identical to the existing Galaxy Zfold identical to the existing Galaxy Zfold identical to the existing Galaxy Zfold 7. Same 6.5 in cover display, the same 7. Same 6.5 in cover display, the same 7. Same 6.5 in cover display, the same sized screen bezels, but then you look sized screen bezels, but then you look sized screen bezels, but then you look around the device and it's a chunker. around the device and it's a chunker. around the device and it's a chunker. The thing weighs in at 309 g. So side by The thing weighs in at 309 g. So side by The thing weighs in at 309 g. So side by side with current foldables, the trifold side with current foldables, the trifold side with current foldables, the trifold is almost 50% heavier. And just the is almost 50% heavier. And just the is almost 50% heavier. And just the sheer thickness from having this entire sheer thickness from having this entire sheer thickness from having this entire extra layer means that this absolutely extra layer means that this absolutely extra layer means that this absolutely cannot pass as a normal phone when it's cannot pass as a normal phone when it's cannot pass as a normal phone when it's folded up. And then to open it, you kind folded up. And then to open it, you kind folded up. And then to open it, you kind of do what you normally do with the of do what you normally do with the of do what you normally do with the fold. You reach around, but then instead fold. You reach around, but then instead fold. You reach around, but then instead of grabbing one layer, you grab two and of grabbing one layer, you grab two and of grabbing one layer, you grab two and you pull them out, followed by a second you pull them out, followed by a second you pull them out, followed by a second unfolding to get you to complete tablet unfolding to get you to complete tablet unfolding to get you to complete tablet form. I'd say it takes 20 minutes before form. I'd say it takes 20 minutes before form. I'd say it takes 20 minutes before that movement starts to feel very that movement starts to feel very that movement starts to feel very intuitive. Helped in part by how the intuitive. Helped in part by how the intuitive. Helped in part by how the thing will vibrate aggressively if you thing will vibrate aggressively if you thing will vibrate aggressively if you try and fold it in a way that you're not try and fold it in a way that you're not try and fold it in a way that you're not meant to. And also by how if you look meant to. And also by how if you look meant to. And also by how if you look closely, can you see that the rear closely, can you see that the rear closely, can you see that the rear section is actually a tiny bit longer section is actually a tiny bit longer section is actually a tiny bit longer than the others? Well, that protrusion than the others? Well, that protrusion than the others? Well, that protrusion exists so that when you are reaching exists so that when you are reaching exists so that when you are reaching around to grab those top two layers to around to grab those top two layers to around to grab those top two layers to unfold it, they feel separated from the unfold it, they feel separated from the unfold it, they feel separated from the back one. And then when you've unfolded back one. And then when you've unfolded back one. And then when you've unfolded that, you'll notice the middle panel that, you'll notice the middle panel that, you'll notice the middle panel then pops up ever so slightly because then pops up ever so slightly because then pops up ever so slightly because there's a magnet behind pushing it, there's a magnet behind pushing it, there's a magnet behind pushing it, which makes [music] that one easier to which makes [music] that one easier to which makes [music] that one easier to lift as opposed to you having to dig lift as opposed to you having to dig lift as opposed to you having to dig your claws underneath it. These are your claws underneath it. These are your claws underneath it. These are clever touches, and it actually makes clever touches, and it actually makes clever touches, and it actually makes this whole maneuver less fiddly than you this whole maneuver less fiddly than you this whole maneuver less fiddly than you might be expecting. And considering how might be expecting. And considering how might be expecting. And considering how thin the phone ends up, 3.9 mm at its thin the phone ends up, 3.9 mm at its thin the phone ends up, 3.9 mm at its slimmest point, making this the thinnest slimmest point, making this the thinnest slimmest point, making this the thinnest Samsung phone by quite a margin, I'm Samsung phone by quite a margin, I'm Samsung phone by quite a margin, I'm super impressed by how solid everything super impressed by how solid everything super impressed by how solid everything feels. It's got nice snappy magnets, feels. It's got nice snappy magnets, feels. It's got nice snappy magnets, zero wobble, and the whole thing does zero wobble, and the whole thing does zero wobble, and the whole thing does lock out completely flat when unfolded. lock out completely flat when unfolded. lock out completely flat when unfolded. But at the same time, there are But at the same time, there are But at the same time, there are absolutely some niggles here. There's absolutely some niggles here. There's absolutely some niggles here. There's creases now on the display. Yes, they creases now on the display. Yes, they creases now on the display. Yes, they are multiplying because there's two sets are multiplying because there's two sets are multiplying because there's two sets of hinges now. And I would say each one of hinges now. And I would say each one of hinges now. And I would say each one of these creases is fairly prominent. of these creases is fairly prominent. of these creases is fairly prominent. Like the moment any kind of light casts Like the moment any kind of light casts Like the moment any kind of light casts on your screen, you will be reminded of on your screen, you will be reminded of on your screen, you will be reminded of their lurking presence. There's the fact their lurking presence. There's the fact their lurking presence. There's the fact that the phone's incredible weight that the phone's incredible weight that the phone's incredible weight combined with the typical Samsung camera combined with the typical Samsung camera combined with the typical Samsung camera placement in the top corner and the placement in the top corner and the placement in the top corner and the narrow width of the phone all put narrow width of the phone all put narrow width of the phone all put together makes this practically unusable together makes this practically unusable together makes this practically unusable on a flat surface with every tap on a flat surface with every tap on a flat surface with every tap eliciting a resounding thunk from your eliciting a resounding thunk from your eliciting a resounding thunk from your table. When unfolded, it's a little table. When unfolded, it's a little table. When unfolded, it's a little better, but still not great. The only better, but still not great. The only better, but still not great. The only thing that mostly fixes it is the case, thing that mostly fixes it is the case, thing that mostly fixes it is the case, which may well explain why they [music] which may well explain why they [music] which may well explain why they [music] decided to include it. The main thing decided to include it. The main thing decided to include it. The main thing that I find difficult about this trifold that I find difficult about this trifold that I find difficult about this trifold though is just the absolute insane task though is just the absolute insane task though is just the absolute insane task that it is to look after the thing. The that it is to look after the thing. The that it is to look after the thing. The phone is finished with a fiberglass phone is finished with a fiberglass phone is finished with a fiberglass composite material. I assume it's a composite material. I assume it's a composite material. I assume it's a strengthtoe ratio decision that you strengthtoe ratio decision that you strengthtoe ratio decision that you don't want thick Gorilla Glass across don't want thick Gorilla Glass across don't want thick Gorilla Glass across every surface when you're trying to every surface when you're trying to every surface when you're trying to shave off every micrometer. But the shave off every micrometer. But the shave off every micrometer. But the issue is with its viny type texture. issue is with its viny type texture. issue is with its viny type texture. It's [music] a bit sticky and pretty It's [music] a bit sticky and pretty It's [music] a bit sticky and pretty shiny, which means that every one of the shiny, which means that every one of the shiny, which means that every one of the six faces of this trifold device is six faces of this trifold device is six faces of this trifold device is consistently picking up fingerprints. consistently picking up fingerprints. consistently picking up fingerprints. So, it is borderline impossible to be So, it is borderline impossible to be So, it is borderline impossible to be holding this and unfolding this in a way holding this and unfolding this in a way holding this and unfolding this in a way where you're not persistently messing where you're not persistently messing where you're not persistently messing something up. And while the fingerprints something up. And while the fingerprints something up. And while the fingerprints can be fixed with a wipe or seven, can be fixed with a wipe or seven, can be fixed with a wipe or seven, you'll have a much harder time trying to you'll have a much harder time trying to you'll have a much harder time trying to fix any damage to your screen. I don't fix any damage to your screen. I don't fix any damage to your screen. I don't anticipate the cover display will be an anticipate the cover display will be an anticipate the cover display will be an issue cuz it's protected by Gorilla issue cuz it's protected by Gorilla issue cuz it's protected by Gorilla Glass ceramic, too. But this inner Glass ceramic, too. But this inner Glass ceramic, too. But this inner screen, or at least the screen protector screen, or at least the screen protector screen, or at least the screen protector that rests on it, which you can't that rests on it, which you can't that rests on it, which you can't replace without giving the phone back to replace without giving the phone back to replace without giving the phone back to Samsung, is so soft that I managed to Samsung, is so soft that I managed to Samsung, is so soft that I managed to get deep gouges on mine just by leaning get deep gouges on mine just by leaning get deep gouges on mine just by leaning it against a vase. Plus, now remember it against a vase. Plus, now remember it against a vase. Plus, now remember with a trifold, you've got more room with a trifold, you've got more room with a trifold, you've got more room than ever for random pocket particles to than ever for random pocket particles to than ever for random pocket particles to end up between your screens. So, the end up between your screens. So, the end up between your screens. So, the maintenance is a real consideration. And maintenance is a real consideration. And maintenance is a real consideration. And specs-wise, I wouldn't say there's specs-wise, I wouldn't say there's specs-wise, I wouldn't say there's anything particularly special going on anything particularly special going on anything particularly special going on here. Like, the chip is the Snapdragon 8 here. Like, the chip is the Snapdragon 8 here. Like, the chip is the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which is still very powerful. And Elite, which is still very powerful. And Elite, which is still very powerful. And of course, gaming on this inner display of course, gaming on this inner display of course, gaming on this inner display [music] is a spectacular experience. But [music] is a spectacular experience. But [music] is a spectacular experience. But notably, this is not the absolute latest notably, this is not the absolute latest notably, this is not the absolute latest Elite Gen 5 chip that some phones have Elite Gen 5 chip that some phones have Elite Gen 5 chip that some phones have already started shipping with. So, this already started shipping with. So, this already started shipping with. So, this is lagging behind from day one. 16 GB of is lagging behind from day one. 16 GB of is lagging behind from day one. 16 GB of RAM, which is the same as the topsp spec RAM, which is the same as the topsp spec RAM, which is the same as the topsp spec version of the ZFold 7, but cool to see version of the ZFold 7, but cool to see version of the ZFold 7, but cool to see it come as standard on the Trifold with it come as standard on the Trifold with it come as standard on the Trifold with 512 gigs of fast storage. The cameras 512 gigs of fast storage. The cameras 512 gigs of fast storage. The cameras are pretty much onetoone copied directly are pretty much onetoone copied directly are pretty much onetoone copied directly from the ZFold 7, which is to say great from the ZFold 7, which is to say great from the ZFold 7, which is to say great main 200 megapixel camera, but then a main 200 megapixel camera, but then a main 200 megapixel camera, but then a fairly mid experience when it comes to fairly mid experience when it comes to fairly mid experience when it comes to the 10 megapixel three time zoom camera the 10 megapixel three time zoom camera the 10 megapixel three time zoom camera and the 12 megapixel ultrawide. You do and the 12 megapixel ultrawide. You do and the 12 megapixel ultrawide. You do have the extra foldable benefits of have the extra foldable benefits of have the extra foldable benefits of being able to let whoever you're being able to let whoever you're being able to let whoever you're capturing see themselves and then being capturing see themselves and then being capturing see themselves and then being able to see yourself while shooting able to see yourself while shooting able to see yourself while shooting selfies with your main rear cameras and selfies with your main rear cameras and selfies with your main rear cameras and you can also see your recent shots while you can also see your recent shots while you can also see your recent shots while you capture new ones. But as far as I you capture new ones. But as far as I you capture new ones. But as far as I can find, there is no distinct camera can find, there is no distinct camera can find, there is no distinct camera benefit from this being a trifold versus benefit from this being a trifold versus benefit from this being a trifold versus the normal biffolds. Tell you what does the normal biffolds. Tell you what does the normal biffolds. Tell you what does put a smile on my face. The battery has put a smile on my face. The battery has put a smile on my face. The battery has had some love. Compared to the 4,400 mAh had some love. Compared to the 4,400 mAh had some love. Compared to the 4,400 mAh capacity on the ZFold 7, this trifold capacity on the ZFold 7, this trifold capacity on the ZFold 7, this trifold gets 5,600, which because the thing's so gets 5,600, which because the thing's so gets 5,600, which because the thing's so thin, has had to be achieved with three thin, has had to be achieved with three thin, has had to be achieved with three separate batteries, one per slice. And separate batteries, one per slice. And separate batteries, one per slice. And it charges faster than other foldables. it charges faster than other foldables. it charges faster than other foldables. with 45watt wire charging, which is the with 45watt wire charging, which is the with 45watt wire charging, which is the same as Samsung's top-end S25 Ultra, and same as Samsung's top-end S25 Ultra, and same as Samsung's top-end S25 Ultra, and then 15 watt wireless charging while then 15 watt wireless charging while then 15 watt wireless charging while retaining the same IP48 water and dust retaining the same IP48 water and dust retaining the same IP48 water and dust resistance as the Galaxy Zfold 7, which resistance as the Galaxy Zfold 7, which resistance as the Galaxy Zfold 7, which is good as far as foldables go, but just is good as far as foldables go, but just is good as far as foldables go, but just less than what you would get on a bar less than what you would get on a bar less than what you would get on a bar phone. So, really, what this all comes phone. So, really, what this all comes phone. So, really, what this all comes down to, the only reason that I think down to, the only reason that I think down to, the only reason that I think this is still overall a really this is still overall a really this is still overall a really compelling phone is the 10-in 16x11 compelling phone is the 10-in 16x11 compelling phone is the 10-in 16x11 aspect ratio display that you get on the aspect ratio display that you get on the aspect ratio display that you get on the inside and what Samsung have enabled you inside and what Samsung have enabled you inside and what Samsung have enabled you to do with it. And I'd split this into to do with it. And I'd split this into to do with it. And I'd split this into three categories. First is the pretty three categories. First is the pretty three categories. First is the pretty obvious quantity of information. The obvious quantity of information. The obvious quantity of information. The moment that you start opening full moment that you start opening full moment that you start opening full screen apps on this, it is very screen apps on this, it is very screen apps on this, it is very immediately clear that this is not just immediately clear that this is not just immediately clear that this is not just a stretched version of the typical a stretched version of the typical a stretched version of the typical foldable experience. The apps actually foldable experience. The apps actually foldable experience. The apps actually just [music] work better. Like with the just [music] work better. Like with the just [music] work better. Like with the files app, you can now go into a folder files app, you can now go into a folder files app, you can now go into a folder and then into a subfolder while still and then into a subfolder while still and then into a subfolder while still keeping every part of the file directory keeping every part of the file directory keeping every part of the file directory on screen at once. The gallery's got a on screen at once. The gallery's got a on screen at once. The gallery's got a tweaked interface with this really slick tweaked interface with this really slick tweaked interface with this really slick navigation bar, but still while giving navigation bar, but still while giving navigation bar, but still while giving you tons of extra room to see your you tons of extra room to see your you tons of extra room to see your [music] photos. Actually, a pretty cool [music] photos. Actually, a pretty cool [music] photos. Actually, a pretty cool comparison is Samsung Health. Have a comparison is Samsung Health. Have a comparison is Samsung Health. Have a look at just how much more content fits look at just how much more content fits look at just how much more content fits on the screen of the Trifold versus the on the screen of the Trifold versus the on the screen of the Trifold versus the ZFold 7, and therefore how much less ZFold 7, and therefore how much less ZFold 7, and therefore how much less scrolling you have to do. Same for scrolling you have to do. Same for scrolling you have to do. Same for YouTube. Can you see how it's not just YouTube. Can you see how it's not just YouTube. Can you see how it's not just bigger, but it's completely reformatted bigger, but it's completely reformatted bigger, but it's completely reformatted so that you can see and scroll through so that you can see and scroll through so that you can see and scroll through suggested videos and [music] flick suggested videos and [music] flick suggested videos and [music] flick through a lot more comments in one go through a lot more comments in one go through a lot more comments in one go without needing to interrupt or shrink without needing to interrupt or shrink without needing to interrupt or shrink the video that you're also trying to the video that you're also trying to the video that you're also trying to watch. And then if you did want to just watch. And then if you did want to just watch. And then if you did want to just solely focus on the content, then that solely focus on the content, then that solely focus on the content, then that content gets even bigger than the content gets even bigger than the content gets even bigger than the increased size of the phone would increased size of the phone would increased size of the phone would suggest. Because the trifold opens out suggest. Because the trifold opens out suggest. Because the trifold opens out to [music] be more rectangular than to [music] be more rectangular than to [music] be more rectangular than square, then as long as it is widescreen square, then as long as it is widescreen square, then as long as it is widescreen content, which let's be honest, it content, which let's be honest, it content, which let's be honest, it almost definitely will be, you're almost definitely will be, you're almost definitely will be, you're getting like a 50% bigger overall getting like a 50% bigger overall getting like a 50% bigger overall picture with [music] still noticeable, picture with [music] still noticeable, picture with [music] still noticeable, but much smaller black bars on the top but much smaller black bars on the top but much smaller black bars on the top and bottom. And it's a nice extra to and bottom. And it's a nice extra to and bottom. And it's a nice extra to also be able to have two different also be able to have two different also be able to have two different orientations. You know, the normal fold, orientations. You know, the normal fold, orientations. You know, the normal fold, it doesn't really matter which way you it doesn't really matter which way you it doesn't really matter which way you hold it. It's a square. Whereas the hold it. It's a square. Whereas the hold it. It's a square. Whereas the trifold, like a typical tablet, lets you trifold, like a typical tablet, lets you trifold, like a typical tablet, lets you rotate into portrait orientation, rotate into portrait orientation, rotate into portrait orientation, [music] which is just how I like my doom [music] which is just how I like my doom [music] which is just how I like my doom scrolling sessions. So my point is that scrolling sessions. So my point is that scrolling sessions. So my point is that instead of a biffold phone where you instead of a biffold phone where you instead of a biffold phone where you feel like you're almost straddling two feel like you're almost straddling two feel like you're almost straddling two different types of form factor and your different types of form factor and your different types of form factor and your apps often feel like a clumsy halfway apps often feel like a clumsy halfway apps often feel like a clumsy halfway house [music] between them. What I love house [music] between them. What I love house [music] between them. What I love about this trifold is that you can move about this trifold is that you can move about this trifold is that you can move between two very clear distinct classes between two very clear distinct classes between two very clear distinct classes of app. The pure smartphone layout of an of app. The pure smartphone layout of an of app. The pure smartphone layout of an app when it's folded and then the pure app when it's folded and then the pure app when it's folded and then the pure uncompromised tablet layout of an app uncompromised tablet layout of an app uncompromised tablet layout of an app when you're unfolded. And remember, when you're unfolded. And remember, when you're unfolded. And remember, Samsung has had plenty of time to Samsung has had plenty of time to Samsung has had plenty of time to optimize that side of the equation optimize that side of the equation optimize that side of the equation because they've been making tablets with because they've been making tablets with because they've been making tablets with 10-in displays very similar to this one 10-in displays very similar to this one 10-in displays very similar to this one for over a decade. The second notable for over a decade. The second notable for over a decade. The second notable feature then of this extra-large display feature then of this extra-large display feature then of this extra-large display is that the trifold is the first time on is that the trifold is the first time on is that the trifold is the first time on a phone where you cannot just use a phone where you cannot just use a phone where you cannot just use Samsung Dex, but it kind of is Samsung Samsung Dex, but it kind of is Samsung Samsung Dex, but it kind of is Samsung Dex. So, Samsung phones have had Dex for Dex. So, Samsung phones have had Dex for Dex. So, Samsung phones have had Dex for ages. You flick down, you select the ages. You flick down, you select the ages. You flick down, you select the option for Dex, you choose a monitor to option for Dex, you choose a monitor to option for Dex, you choose a monitor to connect your phone up to. You can even connect your phone up to. You can even connect your phone up to. You can even wirelessly connect to a monitor these wirelessly connect to a monitor these wirelessly connect to a monitor these days and that will basically cast this days and that will basically cast this days and that will basically cast this desktop style interface to use on that desktop style interface to use on that desktop style interface to use on that monitor with your phone acting as the monitor with your phone acting as the monitor with your phone acting as the computer and then a mouse and keyboard computer and then a mouse and keyboard computer and then a mouse and keyboard as your way to interface [music] with as your way to interface [music] with as your way to interface [music] with it. But now the phone is big enough that it. But now the phone is big enough that it. But now the phone is big enough that it can also just be the monitor. So it can also just be the monitor. So it can also just be the monitor. So flick down from the control panel, click flick down from the control panel, click flick down from the control panel, click Dex here, and you're just in it. It Dex here, and you're just in it. It Dex here, and you're just in it. It won't look immediately different, but it won't look immediately different, but it won't look immediately different, but it is a very different way to use Android. is a very different way to use Android. is a very different way to use Android. For example, when you open apps in Dex For example, when you open apps in Dex For example, when you open apps in Dex mode now, they will default to this mode now, they will default to this mode now, they will default to this windowed view where you can move them windowed view where you can move them windowed view where you can move them around by dragging the tops and [music] around by dragging the tops and [music] around by dragging the tops and [music] resize them by dragging the corners. It resize them by dragging the corners. It resize them by dragging the corners. It also means that you can have multiple also means that you can have multiple also means that you can have multiple permanent desktops. So, let's say I'm permanent desktops. So, let's say I'm permanent desktops. So, let's say I'm playing a game here, but I'm done for a playing a game here, but I'm done for a playing a game here, but I'm done for a minute. I can keep that [music] game in minute. I can keep that [music] game in minute. I can keep that [music] game in memory while I temporarily flick over to memory while I temporarily flick over to memory while I temporarily flick over to the football match I'm catching up on the football match I'm catching up on the football match I'm catching up on and the new app that I'm looking to and the new app that I'm looking to and the new app that I'm looking to download from the Play Store on my download from the Play Store on my download from the Play Store on my second desktop. It's still not quite second desktop. It's still not quite second desktop. It's still not quite like using a laptop in that generally like using a laptop in that generally like using a laptop in that generally any of the more intense applications any of the more intense applications any of the more intense applications will pause when you're not actively will pause when you're not actively will pause when you're not actively using them or playing them. But for the using them or playing them. But for the using them or playing them. But for the purposes of office type work, it's purposes of office type work, it's purposes of office type work, it's pretty close, especially when you pretty close, especially when you pretty close, especially when you connect up to a mouse and a keyboard and connect up to a mouse and a keyboard and connect up to a mouse and a keyboard and you use the fancy kickstand case to prop you use the fancy kickstand case to prop you use the fancy kickstand case to prop the whole thing up. The fact that this the whole thing up. The fact that this the whole thing up. The fact that this setup folds up to fit inside your pocket setup folds up to fit inside your pocket setup folds up to fit inside your pocket is super impressive to me and I would is super impressive to me and I would is super impressive to me and I would say well past the point of being say well past the point of being say well past the point of being gimmicky. Let's be very clear though, gimmicky. Let's be very clear though, gimmicky. Let's be very clear though, this is not the first triple folding this is not the first triple folding this is not the first triple folding phone. You've probably seen Huawei phone. You've probably seen Huawei phone. You've probably seen Huawei already take a stab at this form factor already take a stab at this form factor already take a stab at this form factor last year. And I do actually think that last year. And I do actually think that last year. And I do actually think that phone did some things better. Like phone did some things better. Like phone did some things better. Like instead of the Samsung, which folds out instead of the Samsung, which folds out instead of the Samsung, which folds out like a U, the Huawei folded out like a like a U, the Huawei folded out like a like a U, the Huawei folded out like a Z, which meant that you could use one Z, which meant that you could use one Z, which meant that you could use one part of the screen, you could use two part of the screen, you could use two part of the screen, you could use two parts of the screen, or you could use parts of the screen, or you could use parts of the screen, or you could use all three. Whereas the Samsung is a all three. Whereas the Samsung is a all three. Whereas the Samsung is a little bit more rigid. It only lets you little bit more rigid. It only lets you little bit more rigid. It only lets you go between the one cover screen and then go between the one cover screen and then go between the one cover screen and then the completely unfolded inner screen. the completely unfolded inner screen. the completely unfolded inner screen. And also, Huawei managed to achieve all And also, Huawei managed to achieve all And also, Huawei managed to achieve all three of these form factors with just three of these form factors with just three of these form factors with just one folding display. Whereas Samsung's one folding display. Whereas Samsung's one folding display. Whereas Samsung's cover screen is a completely separate cover screen is a completely separate cover screen is a completely separate additional component to its folding additional component to its folding additional component to its folding display, which will be what's making display, which will be what's making display, which will be what's making this trifold the heavier of the two this trifold the heavier of the two this trifold the heavier of the two phones. I brought this up with Samsung. phones. I brought this up with Samsung. phones. I brought this up with Samsung. I said, \"Why did you make yours like I said, \"Why did you make yours like I said, \"Why did you make yours like this even though it's less space this even though it's less space this even though it's less space efficient?\" And they said it's so that efficient?\" And they said it's so that efficient?\" And they said it's so that when the phone is folded up, no part of when the phone is folded up, no part of when the phone is folded up, no part of the soft inner display is being exposed the soft inner display is being exposed the soft inner display is being exposed to the elements, which I suppose seeing to the elements, which I suppose seeing to the elements, which I suppose seeing just how soft that inner display is just how soft that inner display is just how soft that inner display is feels somewhat justified. But then Dex feels somewhat justified. But then Dex feels somewhat justified. But then Dex has one final trick up its sleeve. So, has one final trick up its sleeve. So, has one final trick up its sleeve. So, just like with other phones, you can just like with other phones, you can just like with other phones, you can also still use it to connect up to a also still use it to connect up to a also still use it to connect up to a monitor. It's just that when you do it monitor. It's just that when you do it monitor. It's just that when you do it on this trifold, the trifold itself can on this trifold, the trifold itself can on this trifold, the trifold itself can become an extension to that monitor. So, become an extension to that monitor. So, become an extension to that monitor. So, even if you just have your phone and even if you just have your phone and even if you just have your phone and your laptop, you can have a dual monitor your laptop, you can have a dual monitor your laptop, you can have a dual monitor display on the go, which you have been display on the go, which you have been display on the go, which you have been able to do before on Samsung tablets. I able to do before on Samsung tablets. I able to do before on Samsung tablets. I just think it's sick that you can now do just think it's sick that you can now do just think it's sick that you can now do it with a phone that will almost it with a phone that will almost it with a phone that will almost definitely be with you. That said, I definitely be with you. That said, I definitely be with you. That said, I probably won't be doing a whole lot of probably won't be doing a whole lot of probably won't be doing a whole lot of dexing just because the way this phone dexing just because the way this phone dexing just because the way this phone handles multitasking, even without it, handles multitasking, even without it, handles multitasking, even without it, is really intuitive. So, let's say we is really intuitive. So, let's say we is really intuitive. So, let's say we load up the Netflix app on this side and load up the Netflix app on this side and load up the Netflix app on this side and then a browser on this side for some then a browser on this side for some then a browser on this side for some casual shopping while we watch. Let's casual shopping while we watch. Let's casual shopping while we watch. Let's search for friends cuz I'm in the middle search for friends cuz I'm in the middle search for friends cuz I'm in the middle of my fourth watch through right now and of my fourth watch through right now and of my fourth watch through right now and oh, it's not there. So now we drag Surf oh, it's not there. So now we drag Surf oh, it's not there. So now we drag Surf SharkVPN, our sponsor, to the far right, SharkVPN, our sponsor, to the far right, SharkVPN, our sponsor, to the far right, and that becomes the third app running and that becomes the third app running and that becomes the third app running in parallel, which [music] makes us feel in parallel, which [music] makes us feel in parallel, which [music] makes us feel very much just like three normal bar very much just like three normal bar very much just like three normal bar phones glued to each other. So now we phones glued to each other. So now we phones glued to each other. So now we can use that to change what country can use that to change what country can use that to change what country Netflix thinks we're in from South Korea Netflix thinks we're in from South Korea Netflix thinks we're in from South Korea to the UK. And if we now go back to to the UK. And if we now go back to to the UK. And if we now go back to Netflix, then like magic, friends just Netflix, then like magic, friends just Netflix, then like magic, friends just reappears and we can resume the binge. reappears and we can resume the binge. reappears and we can resume the binge. What's also cool is there's a little What's also cool is there's a little What's also cool is there's a little button here to quickly swap the position button here to quickly swap the position button here to quickly swap the position of the apps. So you're not bound by the of the apps. So you're not bound by the of the apps. So you're not bound by the order that you open them in. And even order that you open them in. And even order that you open them in. And even though there is tons going on at once, though there is tons going on at once, though there is tons going on at once, every animation that I tested was every animation that I tested was every animation that I tested was buttery smooth. From here, then you can buttery smooth. From here, then you can buttery smooth. From here, then you can also change the layout, flicking between also change the layout, flicking between also change the layout, flicking between the more uniform three apps in portrait the more uniform three apps in portrait the more uniform three apps in portrait view. And then what I'm going to call view. And then what I'm going to call view. And then what I'm going to call the one big, two small view. I guess the one big, two small view. I guess the one big, two small view. I guess you'd use this when you're focused you'd use this when you're focused you'd use this when you're focused mostly on one app, but you just want to mostly on one app, but you just want to mostly on one app, but you just want to keep an eye on a couple of other things, keep an eye on a couple of other things, keep an eye on a couple of other things, like the score of a football game or the like the score of a football game or the like the score of a football game or the WhatsApp [music] chat you're expecting a WhatsApp [music] chat you're expecting a WhatsApp [music] chat you're expecting a quick update from. But my favorite part quick update from. But my favorite part quick update from. But my favorite part of this is how you can then save any of of this is how you can then save any of of this is how you can then save any of these three apps as a trio. Meaning you these three apps as a trio. Meaning you these three apps as a trio. Meaning you can launch them as a trio by tapping can launch them as a trio by tapping can launch them as a trio by tapping this one icon and how that icon shows this one icon and how that icon shows this one icon and how that icon shows you not just which apps they are, but you not just which apps they are, but you not just which apps they are, but also in what layout they're going to also in what layout they're going to also in what layout they're going to open in. So if your trio is set to open open in. So if your trio is set to open open in. So if your trio is set to open the apps, each in the portrait view, the apps, each in the portrait view, the apps, each in the portrait view, then you will see each of the logos then you will see each of the logos then you will see each of the logos small and side by side like that in the small and side by side like that in the small and side by side like that in the icon. And likewise, if you've set say icon. And likewise, if you've set say icon. And likewise, if you've set say surf shark to always open as the main surf shark to always open as the main surf shark to always open as the main window, then can you see how its logo is window, then can you see how its logo is window, then can you see how its logo is displaying bigger than the other two? displaying bigger than the other two? displaying bigger than the other two? And if you go to surfshark.com/boss, And if you go to surfshark.com/boss, And if you go to surfshark.com/boss, you can get Surf Shark for less than $2 you can get Surf Shark for less than $2 you can get Surf Shark for less than $2 a month with four extra months for free. a month with four extra months for free. a month with four extra months for free. The only downside that I could find with The only downside that I could find with The only downside that I could find with this superersized display is brightness. this superersized display is brightness. this superersized display is brightness. The Trifold inner display has a peak of The Trifold inner display has a peak of The Trifold inner display has a peak of 1,600 nits, which compares to 2600 on 1,600 nits, which compares to 2600 on 1,600 nits, which compares to 2600 on the ZFold 7, which will matter the ZFold 7, which will matter the ZFold 7, which will matter occasionally, but the day-to-day occasionally, but the day-to-day occasionally, but the day-to-day difference won't be nearly as much as difference won't be nearly as much as difference won't be nearly as much as that number makes it sound. So, that number makes it sound. So, that number makes it sound. So, honestly, I don't think the Trifold is honestly, I don't think the Trifold is honestly, I don't think the Trifold is this experimental quirky phone option. I this experimental quirky phone option. I this experimental quirky phone option. I actually think that this phone has actually think that this phone has actually think that this phone has immediately become the definitive immediately become the definitive immediately become the definitive Samsung foldable. You will have to Samsung foldable. You will have to Samsung foldable. You will have to handle it with care and you'll handle it with care and you'll handle it with care and you'll definitely have to pay for the definitely have to pay for the definitely have to pay for the privilege. I don't have the final dollar privilege. I don't have the final dollar privilege. I don't have the final dollar price yet, but the Korean price converts price yet, but the Korean price converts price yet, but the Korean price converts to around $2,400, to around $2,400, to around $2,400, which when you consider that that is 50% which when you consider that that is 50% which when you consider that that is 50% more expensive than the Korean price of more expensive than the Korean price of more expensive than the Korean price of the ZFold 7. I would guess we're looking the ZFold 7. I would guess we're looking the ZFold 7. I would guess we're looking at closer to $3,000 when it launches at closer to $3,000 when it launches at closer to $3,000 when it launches soon in the US. It's fine. Just think of soon in the US. It's fine. Just think of soon in the US. It's fine. Just think of it like a grander slice. But because it like a grander slice. But because it like a grander slice. But because Samsung has spent so long making normal Samsung has spent so long making normal Samsung has spent so long making normal foldables and so long making tablets, foldables and so long making tablets, foldables and so long making tablets, this fusion of the two products doesn't this fusion of the two products doesn't this fusion of the two products doesn't feel like the first gen experiment that feel like the first gen experiment that feel like the first gen experiment that you might expect it to.

Smart Glasses are Suddenly Good?", "language": "en", "content": "(intriguing music) - All right, so I'm in the middle of reviewing these new iPhones, which are pretty interesting, but you know, they're new iPhones so they're iterative. And then Meta of course decides to also have an event 'cause it's Techtember and things just don't stop. So I put that down for a second. I fly back out to California, and what Meta has to show me is actually shockingly advanced. Because just 10 months ago, I saw this, I made a whole video about it. These are Meta's Orion AR glasses prototypes, which were super cool and overlaid software onto the world around you. But they can never sell these things because the materials alone cost like 10 grand, and they're a bit too cumbersome, and they have a whole separate stick with a computer in it that's nearby, and they overheat, and the battery lasts like an hour. It was a cool proof of concept of a bleeding-edge technology but not a real product. Now here we are 10 months later, and they're handing me a finished product with a price tag and a release date. And it's these, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, clever name, I know, but it's essentially an updated version of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's massively better than the Orion prototype. Now the main difference with these is these are a monocular display, meaning it's only showing up in one eye, the right eye, and it's fixed slightly lower and to the right of the middle of your vision, but it's still full color, plenty sharp, 42 pixels per degree to be exact, and more than bright enough to be seen outdoors. I tried these things outdoors, gets up to 5,000 nits. So it's like a real-life little HUD in the corner of your vision that you can turn on or off at any time, and you still control everything through a neural band on your wrist that uses surface EMG technology to read the electrical impulses going through your arm as you make different gestures that you pretty quickly memorize and can draw discreetly and quietly with pretty good accuracy. You can scroll up, scroll down, select, you can go forward and backward, and even turn up and down volume by pinching in the air and twisting slowly. And as I'm getting to try these, I just keep thinking, \"The rate of improvement is kind of insane.\" For example, the light leak you might remember from Orion was very evident. Like you could see clearly when someone was looking at something when they were activated with the Orion glasses. Now when I pull something up on the display in these, it's basically invisible to the outside world. The light leak is nearly completely gone. Now of course this is a much smaller field of view, but it's pretty impressive that from most angles there is virtually no way to see that I'm looking at something on the screen in these glasses. Even with the perfect angles, when the light hits just right, all you can really tell is that these glasses do have a waveguide in them and I seem to be looking off to the side a little bit and not directly at you, and that's it. And for the neural band, the controls have gotten even more refined and precise. So back when I tried it 10 months ago, it was pretty good. But you know, the idea of doing text input by just drawing letters in midair with your hand was just an idea. Now it's an actual feature, and it's maybe the most reliable, quickest method of text input that I've tried with these. It's absolutely insane. I was writing whole sentences first try, quickly, with no errors. It was nuts. There's also no separate computer puck necessary for these, like there was with the prototype. Everything is self-contained in the glasses, which are admittedly definitely kind of thick, you know, a little less crazy than the Orions, but you can still tell there's some stuff going on with these if I walk by wearing them. And they weigh 69 grams. Nice. So just as a non-glasses wearer, they are a little bit heavy, like they're just heavy enough to not forget that I'm wearing them, but they're not super cumbersome in my opinion. And of course you cannot underestimate how much aesthetics matter if you're gonna be wearing this computer on your face. Like there needs to be some element of \"fashion.\" And I think they look better in person than they do on camera. And there's also two colors, either black or sand, and they actually come with a matching-colored neural band, black or sand as well. Oh, and the charging case. The charging case is also pure genius. It can either hold the glasses inside or you take them out and it folds down flat in like two seconds and still has enough room for four more charges of battery. This did not get enough attention for how awesome it was, because it came in the middle of a keynote that was kind of an absolute disaster in so many other ways. But I'm impressed with the charging case. Now here's the thing, these Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been out for like four years now and they have been a hit actually. They let you talk to Meta's AI and send messages with your voice and listen to music. But I'm fairly confident that the number-one use of these by far is to use the built-in cameras to record POV videos. So the real question you might be asking is, \"All right, Marques, what does adding a display into the glasses actually get you?\" And I was thinking the same thing. I'm glad you asked, because I have the answers now. So number one, first and foremost, you can obviously see the UI of the glasses instead of just relying entirely on voice commands. So if you wanna do something in the UI with the gestures and never speak a word out loud, that's advantage number one to having a screen. Number two is you can actually see the viewfinder of the camera now, so you can be very sure of exactly what you're capturing and you can review pictures and videos after you've taken them. That's also pretty useful. Number three, messaging and even video calls on your glasses are pretty sick. So if you're in a video call, you can see the person you're talking to and the person on the other end just sees a feed from your forward-facing camera, just straight POV. Then number four, maps, which I think are pretty killer. I've talked about it with Google Glass. If you go to navigate somewhere, you can open up the maps and then get turn-by-turn directions and a rotating map that tracks with your head to match the direction you're facing, which to someone like me with a terrible sense of direction is so clutch. And then number five is subtitling basically anything you want in the real world. It uses the beamforming microphones to specifically listen to whatever's in front of you and then put that live text on the HUD of exactly what they're saying. And it works pretty quickly. And if that speech is in another language, it should be able to live translate everything for you to understand what they're saying. Again, so clutch, and this is all being wrapped into a real product that you can buy this year with a real price tag that is $800, which yeah, it's expensive, it's the price of a whole phone, but it's actually a little bit less expensive than I maybe would've guessed before actually hearing that. I wouldn't be surprised if Meta is actually losing money on the hardware here in an effort to just get them out and get 'em into people's hands. But that also conveniently brings us to maybe the biggest downside of this particular product, which is that it is Meta. And that's not a disaster. I mean, obviously people already like the Meta Ray-Bans already, but it also does mean you still will have the privacy questions of exactly what data's being collected and what they do with it. And then the other thing, I dunno if you noticed, but every app that you use on these glasses is strictly first-party stuff. Like messaging with your friends, that's WhatsApp. Video calls on the glasses, that's also WhatsApp. That's not Google Maps, it's their own mapping service, which I can guarantee won't have the best real-time traffic info or ratings like Google Maps has. And they'll even let you scroll through Instagram Reels because Meta owns Instagram. The only exception I saw to this rule was the music playback was done through a partnership with Spotify. But as of right now, or at launch, there is no app store for these. It's coming allegedly, but not yet. But overall, though, I just can't help but be super impressed with how quickly they have been moving forward with this. Like I said, less than a year ago was that crazy prototype with the separate computer and the $10,000 bill of sale. And now here we are, it's just, it's moving so quickly. And I know we're expecting other entries into the smart-glasses space probably within the next couple months, I think from Samsung and from Google and maybe some others. But as of right now, these are the best smart glasses with a screen that I've tried, hands down. And you know, the sad thing is you wouldn't really get that from the presentation at all. The keynote was so brutal, mainly because so many of the live demos that they tried went about as poorly as they possibly could have. I mean, I watched it live. If you get to watch that back, you'll know what I'm talking about. And it's unfortunate because the product is so cool, and I gotta give them props for trying to do real demos instead of faking everything, I guess. But yeah, this isn't gonna be convincing anyone. - What do I do first? - [AI] You've already combined the base ingredients, so now grate a pear to add to the sauce. - What do I do first? - [AI] You've already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce. - All right, I think the Wi-Fi might be messed up. - [AI] Pause WhatsApp video call. - There we go. (notification chiming) Uh-oh. Well, let's see what happened there. (notification chiming) That's too bad. I don't know what happened. The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology, and then the Wi-Fi on the day kind of catches you. - So yeah, there's a distinct lack of good videos of people using this tech and these headsets right now. But I'm predicting that when these actually do come out in a few weeks, that we're gonna see a pretty significant wave of all this new content of the cool stuff people get to do with this from the live-captioning to the maps to the AI stuff that it's capable of, all at once. People are just gonna start flooding the internet with content about it. But yeah, seeing how fast these improved really actually for the first time in a while, it got me thinking about if it could bring us closer to a post-smartphone world, which is obviously still super far away. These still need a smartphone to connect to, to work. But you know, imagine a world where you're walking around on a scenic hike and you see a cool scene and instead of taking your phone out and putting a computer between you and the scene, you just, you know, snap the picture on your glasses and just appreciate it. Seems nice, right? Then again, would you rather be talking to someone and see them check their phone or their smartwatch real quick, and it's kind of rude, but then they're over it? Or you're talking to someone who's maybe wearing some glasses like this and every once in a while they just kind of glance down and to the right a little bit while they're talking to you and it's subtle, but you don't know if they're actually paying attention to you or not. Something to think about. Anyway, thanks for watching. Catch you very soon in the next one. Peace.

voice and listen to music.", "But I'm fairly confident that the number-one use of these by far is to use the built-in cameras to record POV videos.", "So the real question you might be asking is, \"All right, Marques, what does adding a display into the glasses actually get you?\" And I was thinking the same thing.", "I'm glad you asked, because I have the answers now.", "So number one, first and foremost, you can obviously see the UI of the glasses instead of just relying entirely on voice commands.", "So if you wanna do something in the UI with the gestures and never speak a word out loud, that's advantage number one to having a screen.", "Number two is you can actually see the viewfinder of the camera now, so you can be very sure of exactly what you're capturing and you can review pictures and videos after you've taken them.", "That's also pretty useful.", "Number three, messaging and even video calls on your glasses are pretty sick.", "So if you're in a video call, you can see the person you're talking to and the person on the other end just sees a feed from your forward-facing camera, just straight POV.", "Then number four, maps, which I think are pretty killer.", "I've talked about it with Google Glass.", "If you go to navigate somewhere, you can open up the maps and then get turn-by-turn directions and a rotating map that tracks with your head to match the direction you're facing, which to someone like me with a terrible sense of direction is so clutch.", "And then number five is subtitling basically anything you want in the real world.", "It uses the beamforming microphones to specifically listen to whatever's in front of you and then put that live text on the HUD of exactly what they're saying.", "And it works pretty quickly.", "And if that speech is in another language, it should be able to live translate everything for you to understand what they're saying.", "Again, so clutch, and this is all being wrapped into a real product that you can buy this year with a real price tag that is $800, which yeah, it's expensive, it's the price of a whole phone, but it's actually a little bit less expensive than I maybe would've guessed before actually hearing that.", "I wouldn't be surprised if Meta is actually losing money on the hardware here in an effort to just get them out and get 'em into people's hands.", "But that also conveniently brings us to maybe the biggest downside of this particular product, which is that it is Meta.", "And that's not a disaster.", "I mean, obviously people already like the Meta Ray-Bans already, but it also does mean you still will have the privacy questions of exactly what data's being collected and what they do with it.", "And then the other thing, I dunno if you noticed, but every app that you use on these glasses is strictly first-party stuff.", "Like messaging with your friends, that's WhatsApp.", "Video calls on the glasses, that's also WhatsApp.", "That's not Google Maps, it's their own mapping service, which I can guarantee won't have the best real-time traffic info or ratings like Google Maps has.", "And they'll even let you scroll through Instagram Reels because Meta owns Instagram.", "The only exception I saw to this rule was the music playback was done through a partnership with Spotify.", "But as of right now, or at launch, there is no app store for these.", "It's coming allegedly, but not yet.", "But overall, though, I just can't help but be super impressed with how quickly they have been moving forward with this.", "Like I said, less than a year ago was that crazy prototype with the separate computer and the $10,000 bill of sale.", "And now here we are, it's just, it's moving so quickly.", "And I know we're expecting other entries into the smart-glasses space probably within the next couple months, I think from Samsung and from Google and maybe some others.", "But as of right now, these are the best smart glasses with a screen that I've tried, hands down.", "And you know, the sad thing is you wouldn't really get that from the presentation at all.", "The keynote was so brutal, mainly because so many of the live demos that they tried went about as poorly as they possibly could have.", "I mean, I watched it live.", "If you get to watch that back, you'll know what I'm talking about.", "And it's unfortunate because the product is so cool, and I gotta give them props for trying to do real demos instead of faking everything, I guess.", "But yeah, this isn't gonna be convincing anyone.", "- What do I do first?", "- [AI] You've already combined the base ingredients, so now grate a pear to add to the sauce.", "- What do I do first?", "- [AI] You've already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce.", "- All right, I think the Wi-Fi might be messed up.", "- [AI] Pause WhatsApp video call.", "- There we go.", "(notification chiming) Uh-oh.", "Well, let's see what happened there.", "(notification chiming) That's too bad.", "I don't know what happened.", "The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology, and then the Wi-Fi on the day kind of catches you.", "- So yeah, there's a distinct lack of good videos of people using this tech and these headsets right now.", "But I'm predicting that when these actually do come out in a few weeks, that we're gonna see a pretty significant wave of all this new content of the cool stuff people get to do with this from the live-captioning to the maps to the AI stuff that it's capable of, all at once.", "People are just gonna start flooding the internet with content about it.", "But yeah, seeing how fast these improved really actually for the first time in a while, it got me thinking about if it could bring us closer to a post-smartphone world, which is obviously still super far away.", "These still need a smartphone to connect to, to work.", "But you know, imagine a world where you're walking around on a scenic hike and you see a cool scene and instead of taking your phone out and putting a computer between you and the scene, you just, you know, snap the picture on your glasses and just appreciate it.", "Seems nice, right?", "Then again, would you rather be talking to someone and see them check their phone or their smartwatch real quick, and it's kind of rude, but then they're over it?", "Or you're talking to someone who's maybe wearing some glasses like this and every once in a while they just kind of glance down and to the right a little bit while they're talking to you and it's subtle, but you don't know if they're actually paying attention to you or not.", "Something to think about.", "Anyway, thanks for watching.", "Catch you very soon in the next one.", "Peace.", "(intriguing

For Now", "language": "en", "content": "- All right, so this is the Humane AI Pin. It is a brand new product, and a really, really interesting form factor of an ultra futuristic wearable computer. So in a time of all these crazy gadgets and Vision Pro, and wearable glasses, it's so sick that we get so many genuinely new first generation products like this to give a shot. Unfortunately, it's also the new worst product I think I've ever reviewed, in its current state. There's just so many things bad about it. It's so bad, in fact, that I think it's actually kind of distracting to like understand what the point of the device is as we go through it. So I'm gonna have to separate it out for this video. First, I'm gonna tell you what it is, and what it's supposed to do, and then I'll tell you what my experience has actually been using it. (mellow instrumental music) So this thing is a small, wearable computer, with an AI inside, that can help you throughout your day. It's about the size of a large watch. It has a camera and a microphone, and can interact with the world around you. But in case you can't use that as input, there's also a touch pad and a projector inside, with this super new style of gesture control, with the projection on your hand. It costs $700, plus... A $24 a month subscription plan for the data that comes with it, and all the services and all the online storage. But yeah, $700, plus a subscription. It's already a fun start. So one of the big things off the top is, this does not pair to your smartphone at all. This is its own standalone device, with its own internet connection, with its own phone number. And so this little AI assistant just goes everywhere with you, it's always connected, and that's... You can choose how much or how little to use it alongside your smartphone. So you know, on its face, maybe that's kind of a cool idea, at least. Like the idea is you talk to it like a person, it answers questions, it gives you historical facts, or personalized recommendations, or helps you out with things, like brainstorming or remembering things. It can make phone calls, and send text messages. A ton of stuff. The unfortunate reality though, is this thing is too much of a pain to use to actually want to do most of that stuff alongside your phone. But we'll get there. (mellow instrumental music) All right, let me actually start with the hardware. This little thing, the build of this thing, is actually impressive. Like genuinely, I think if you're looking for a reason to feel like you're not getting ripped off, the hardware packaging actually kind of accomplishes that. Like this pin is solid, it's aluminum, it's dense feeling. There's three colors, actually. There's all matte black, which is the cheapest one. Or for a hundred bucks more, you can get white or this black and silver one that I'm using. And then there's a lot of sensors packed up there. There's a camera, there's microphones, there's lights, there's a tiny class 2 laser projector. So this whole thing is like really densely packed. And then the magnets also that connect everything, are super strong. So the back of this pin is called a \"booster\". It's another battery. So it's got its own internal battery, but then once you attach it to your clothes, it cleverly, through your clothes, magnetizes there. It makes a nice sound when you do. And that's how you get it attached. So you get two of these boosters. And since there's the internal battery, you can literally hot swap between them so the thing stays alive. Very clever. And then it also comes with this extremely well-made, and also very, very reflective charging case. So you can pop it in there, or just your battery in there, keep it topped off. That charges by USB Type-C. This thing is nice. And it also comes with this like desktop charging puck, where you can magnetize in the battery, or the whole thing. The pin and the booster at the same time. So that is a lot of charging and battery related accessories, but they all come with it. And this pin, you know, it's also got these lights up at the top here that light up anytime you're doing anything. And there's also a small pin light notification for when there's something waiting for you. So between the weight of the parts and the strength of the magnets, how it all slaps together, like you can tell that a lot of effort was put into the craftsmanship of this product, which I very much appreciate. It's the best part of the pin, by a lot. (mellow instrumental music) Okay, I want you to forget about the smartphone in your pocket for a second. Like just for a minute, just pretend that doesn't exist. Ignore it, right? This little pin can do a lot of stuff, and is very helpful. So again, think of this thing as an AI assistant that's like by your side, all the time with you. So, you can ask it things. It doesn't have a wake word, it only turns the mic on and listens when you touch it. So you can go... (AI Pin beeps) How tall is the Empire State Building? (AI Pin beeps) And then when you let go, it starts sending that query off to the crowd. The- - [AI Pin] The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall to the tip. - The Cloud. And then gets you an answer, which is great. And it also is multimodal. So that means it can look at the camera, and see things, and interact with the world around you. So... (AI Pin beeps) Look and tell me what you see. (AI Pin beeps) So it'll scan the room, use the Cloud again. That little noise was it taking a little image, sending AI image to the Cloud, analyzing it, getting it back, then deciding what to tell me. - [AI Pin] You are sitting in front of a camera and a laptop. The camera is on a tripod and pointed at you. The laptop is open, and you are looking at it. There are three pictures of dogs on the wall behind you. There is a window to the left of the camera. There is a boom mic on the table in front of you. There is a red carpet on the floor. - Great. The camera can also take pictures, or up to 15 second videos, which it auto uploads while charging. It can also remember things you tell it to remember. And all these things will show up in the Humane Center. So it's like this online web portal for all things connected to the pin. There's no app, it's just the website. So there, you can see a whole history of who you've called, and texted, and what you've listened to, and what answers it gave to your most recent requests, and all the things you told it to remember. It is pretty well-rounded. I think probably its best tech demo feature though, is the translate back and forth. You got a two finger gesture, you can go... (AI Pin beeps) (Marques speaks in Spanish) (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Where's the library? - So it auto detects the language, translates it to English, and the person who speaks back can translate back, as long as you hold on the pin and listen to them. Pretty cool. This is all voice stuff though. So if at any point you're in a loud area, or a very private area, and you don't wanna interact out loud with your voice, that's where this projector comes in. So it seems crazy, but you activate it like that, and then you just hold your finger out, your whole palm, and it becomes a projector screen for the laser projector built into the pin. So it takes a little practice, but eventually you get used to holding your hand up in just the right spot, and then the UI gets projected in this green 720p mini screen on your hand. So you basically use your hand, try to be as flat as possible, and then to interact with it, there are some movement gestures. So there's a time of flight sensor that keeps track of movement, and you move your hand around kind of like rolling a marble around in your hand to select something, then pinch to select. You can then make a fist to go back, and then you literally push forward to move deeper into a menu. So this is like a 3D UI you have to learn. This is obviously very brand new for people, but I think to be fair, it is pretty intuitive. I think if you get a quick 60 second lesson, you kind of already have learned all the things you need. When you first connect the booster to the pin, you can unlock it, and unlocking it with my pin, is like this... Move your hand through space to select the numbers thing. It's literally like moving back and forth through a Rolodex of real numbers. So it's one of those like borderline magic things where the first time you see it, you kind of just get it, and it clicks. Even if it is a little fidgety, and a little bit inaccurate and kind of slow. But that gets us into the review. (mellow instrumental music) So, unfortunately... This thing is bad at almost everything it does, basically all the time. Where do I even start? So I guess first of all, okay, it's supposed to just answer questions, right? It can kinda do that sometimes, but one, it's often slow, because most of these requests go to the Cloud and come back, and there's just a long wait. And two, it's often wrong, because AI still can hallucinate, and there are still issues with it just not understanding correctly, or just saying the wrong thing. And that's not even mentioning server timeouts, if you have a poor internet connection, which happens to me all the time in this studio. So when they do most of the demos, like on their websites and in their videos, they'll ask a question, and then they'll let go, and keep talking to fill the silence, so it's not awkward as you wait for an answer, and realize how long it is. But even on this fast studio wifi here... (AI Pin beeps) Who designed the Washington Monument? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI] Finding designer. The Washington Monument was designed by Robert Mills, a prominent 19th century American architect from South Carolina. The construction was eventually completed by- - Okay. So you can just hold your hand up to put your answer on your hand, and interrupt that it's talking so much. But even that was like a pretty good performance for the AI Pin. In ideal, fast wifi conditions. But there are many, many times when I feel like it's way slower, and it seems like it goes to the internet for almost everything. I mean there's a few queries I guess might be local, like... (AI Pin beeps) What time is it? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] 11:42 AM. - Like that's pretty fast. If I ask the battery life, it can tell me that pretty fast. But it feels like basically everything else is just shoveling it off to the Cloud, not computing on the device, and it takes a while. But it's also just wrong all the time. Like, I remember asking it days before the solar eclipse when the next eclipse was, and it said 2044. I asked it, \"What's some good Asian food in the area?\" And over and over again it thought I said, \"What's the best ash?\" For some reason? When is the next Nets game? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Finding next Nets game. The next Brooklyn Nets game is on Sunday, April 14th, but no specific opponent or location is provided. - I just Googled it. It says it's the 76ers, so that's kind of weird. (AI Pin beeps) What's the traffic to the Empire State Building from here? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Finding direction. Use the voice command feature of AI Pin to ask for traffic information to the Empire State Building, and it will provide you with the details you need. - I did? This stuff happens all the time. But then, speaking of battery life... Really bad. (Marques laughs) And inconsistent, which is annoying. So, it's already kind of bad enough that you have another device, that you also have to charge every single day. But with this, it's actually more than that. You have to constantly babysit the battery, and swap out boosters and charge this thing, and keep it charged multiple times per day. So like I said before, you get two of these things that come with it, and I've had a pin nuke through the entire booster battery in two hours, while not really doing much of anything. I've also had it last like four hours while doing a whole bunch of, you know, photos and videos and requests and laser stuff. And it's also just like constantly warm the whole time. Just all the time. Which is a little bit concerning. I'll also say, multiple times in various situations, I've had it just overheat for seemingly no reason, and tell me to wait a while for it to cool down. I think the heat problem is also amplified because of the gap created by whatever fabric is between the booster and the product, that it is actively, inductively charging. You know, it is a lot of very impressive engineering, but wireless charging is notoriously inefficient, and loses energy via heat, and that's what's happening in here all the time. So just the fact that it's warm, just this warm puck on my chest all day, was just enough to never quite forget that I'm wearing it. Well, that and the weight. Look, it's well-made, like I said, it's really impressive hardware, but it's just a little... I mean, you see that little sag? It's just a little too heavy, in the same way that Vision Pro is just a bit too heavy. When you're wearing the thing, you just wanna make it as light as possible. It's why a lot of this stuff is made of plastic. So when you decide to go aluminum instead, yeah, it's just a little too heavy. I feel like Humane in a lot of their videos, they've got all these thick fabrics, and like heavy jackets, so it doesn't really pull down and sag nearly as much. But if you wear some lighter weight materials like I do, especially when it gets warm outside, this is really gonna start to be noticed. And yes, there are some optional accessories that are lighter weight, but you never quite forget about it. This pin cannot set a timer. This pin cannot set an alarm. This notification light they put up at the corner here, it's there and it works, but it is basically out of my peripheral, my field of use, so I almost never see it. And you know, they also chose this corner for the light, which means it's designed to be worn on this half of the body, which is fine, and you get used to it there, but that's also exactly where most seat belts go, in the US anyway. So, not their fault, just another annoying thing about using it. The photos look pretty bad, and the videos look even worse. They're square-ish in aspect ratio, very noisy, and they max out at 15 seconds. The hub that everything syncs with, for me, just randomly stops working, and I have to refresh it to get it to work again. The projector... As impressive as a technical achievement as it is, it's just not very readable. It's not particularly bright outdoors, and it gets dimmer the further from your hand it is because of physics. And unless I knew what those words were saying, I really can't read very much. And... (Marques chuckles) There are no apps. There just are no apps. So when you first sign up with your Humane account, you get to sync with four accounts. There are your Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Tidal. So the first three are basically for your contacts, and then the last one, Tidal is the exclusive music partner. So there is no Uber access, there is no Spotify access, there's no WhatsApp, there's no calendar, no Gmail, none of that stuff. It's just... I can't book a flight, I can't buy something on Amazon. It just will not do any of that stuff that I just do on my phone. (mellow instrumental music) So I know I've said like a bunch of the downsides and the problems this device has, but I really genuinely think the biggest problem this pin is going to have, is that smartphones are kind of OP. The number one thing I've reminded myself from the week of using this pin, trying to get it to do stuff, is that smartphones are not going anywhere anytime soon. And I think a lot of the comments online have already picked up on this, even without testing and using the pin, which is, okay, there seems like a lot of overlap between what this is and what a smartphone can do. But everything that this pin does, a modern smartphone does better and faster, and easier and in higher quality, and just better in every way. Like your smartphone obviously takes better pictures and videos, and you can frame things more easily. Of course, a phone can call and text people more easily. You can use it in more places, loud places, private places, use it with literally any outfit. Also, a phone, like you can quickly Google things, it's faster to message people back. And of course, it can email people, and use all kinds of app experiences. Do you know what happens when you try to just send someone a picture from the AI Pin? You already know how to do it on your phone. With the AI Pin, okay, you take the picture, then you either try this with your voice, or you pull up the picture, which is just a green 720p jpeg on your hand. I guess that's a good enough preview, sure. You go to send it, you pick your contact, or type in the whole phone number with the gestures. Eventually, you go to send, and it has its own internet connection, and it sends a link to view the picture in the Humane web portal. Like the difference in how easy, how frictionless that is here versus here, it's not even close. And there are honestly many times where I'd be trusting this pin, like I'm reviewing it, I'm living that life, I'm using it, and I'd ask it something, and I would wait so long, and my phone would just be sitting right there, where I could just pick it up and Google the answer in the time it takes me to get hopefully the right answer on the pin. It's just... Phones are OP. (AI Pin beeps) Look and tell me what this is. (AI Pin beeps) Or I'll just do this, I guess. Ah... It's a Cybertruck. - [AI Pin] The photo is of a Cybertruck. An electric pickup truck produced by Tesla. - Yup. Also, I gotta say, when I say phones are OP, like screens in your hand. So sick. Just for the last like 10% of any UI, like you can get almost all the way there with just your voice interaction. But let's say you call an Uber, and you say, \"Take me to the studio from an Uber.\" Even if it could do that, which it can't, but let's say it could. And as you're waiting, you're like, \"I'm gonna just go grab a snack from this Starbucks on the corner.\" How do you adjust your pickup location with this? Ugh. Just that friction of, I could just do it in two seconds on my phone. Or buying something online is another one. I've seen a lot of demos where someone's like, \"Plan me a trip to Europe. Plan me an expedition.\" I don't even wanna buy detergent online on this, because I need to check all the ratings and the titles, and make sure I'm ordering the right one. I do not trust that with just my voice. But I think most critically, for the AI assistant part... I actually love the idea of a virtual assistant that you can talk to like a human. Like this is something we've been chasing for years with Google Assistant, and Siri and Alexa. And now with this new form factor of, you know, a little AI in a box that can be with you everywhere, maybe that can deliver even better on that specific promise, But the thing about a good assistant is it needs to know everything about you. That's even true with a human assistant. Like, it needs to know your schedule, it needs to know where you go every day, it needs to know who you talk to, who your preferences are personally and for products. Like it needs to know everything about you. And your smartphone already knows a lot of things about you. But this is a standalone device that doesn't talk to your phone, and so it doesn't know any of the things about you that your phone knows. So just from that, it's already at such a massive disadvantage for the smartphone for being helpful. I mean, you can do what I did. Fully immerse yourself for several days straight, and tell it to remember everything, and call people, text people from it, but it will always have that gap. And that's not even mentioning this, like I said, it has its own phone number, and so if you text people and call people from this, yeah, it can summarize all of your messages from the day, and all that stuff from these conversations, but it doesn't see any of these conversations. So if you're texting here, this is not the same thread. That gap is always gonna be there. So I guess that begs the question, why didn't they just make this connect to your phone? Everyone has a phone. That's the question that I think a lot of people are wondering. And I think... This is my theory, but I think Humane wants this thing to eventually be a very powerful standalone device someday. And in order to get it to that future, they can't set the precedent now of connecting it to your phone, 'cause then that means they have to remove that feature in the future, and they don't wanna do that. So this device as it exists today is hamstrung by its ideal future version of itself. It's like Vision Pro. Like I talked about it in the Vision Pro review. It doesn't actually pair to your iPhone in any way. It's its own standalone computer. And of course, Apple sees down the road, that could just be like a little pair of smart glasses. You don't need an iPhone to use that. But now, today, this thing is a victim of its future ambition. (mellow instrumental music) It was really hard to come up with a title for this video, but I will say, at one point, my working title for this was, \"This product is either the dumbest thing ever, or I'm an idiot.\" Because yes, it's really, really, really, really bad now. But every once in a while, and I mean a while, I would use it, and it would do exactly what it's supposed to do quickly, and I'd get it. And I'd really feel like that's how it's supposed to feel, and I'd do another request, and it would remind me of reality. But here's an example, right? I've said a thousand times, like, my best ideas, golden rule, they always show up when I can't write them down. Like when I'm about to fall asleep, or I'm in the shower, or driving, right? So I'm using the pin, I'm driving to the studio and I have an idea. I'm not trying to write it down on my phone while driving or pull over, but I had the pin, so I'm driving and I just... (AI Pin beeps) \"Remind me of this cool ABC outro idea for the Humane review.\" (AI Pin beeps) And I just kept driving. And it wrote it down, and it saved it. - [AI Pin] Saving memory. - And when I go check the Humane- - [AI Pin] The outro idea for the Humane review has been saved. - The voice is kind of annoying. But now that's up in the Humane AI Center, so when I arrive at the studio, that thing that I told it to remember, is sitting there waiting for me. That was nice. Or the other thing, the unique first person videos. I could put it in the center of my chest, and take videos. I would never want to distract myself while driving taking a video, but you know, even though the quality's not great, that's the most frictionless version of that, along with smart glasses. That's great. And I think number one, on top of all of this, is if you ask me like, \"Who should buy this device right now?\" I mean, nobody should buy this device right now. But if there's one person who would most consider it, it's the person that wants to spend as little time as possible with a screen in their hands. Like as little time as possible on their phone. And that's me sometimes. I don't wanna doom scroll the second I pull my phone out of my pocket. For that person, if they want that at the expense of everything else, this device represents just a glimmer of hope for that future. Now the problem, of course, is with this device, there's just so much more friction and fumbling and annoyance that comes with it, that you don't wanna do it, even though you would accomplish the goal of less screen time and living in the moment. But yeah, that's the issue with it. I literally had a moment, like we did a shoot in Ohio the other day, which was like a travel day. And I woke up in the morning and I thought like, \"I don't want to deal with this pin today.\" Like I have driving, so the seat belt's gonna be annoying, and then we're gonna go to the airport, and then probably gotta take it off through the metal detector and then put it on again, which means I have to log in with the pin again and... Just all this, and I just was like, \"I don't wanna have to charge this seven times. Like , I don't wanna wear it today.\" So I skipped it. And you should probably skip this product too. And never buy a product based on the future promise of updates to it. Obviously, this is a product that has a long way to go, and there's a team behind it. And look, I gotta say, as a brand new product, and a team trying to make something new... That, I respect. I respect the attempt. Because we don't get a lot of totally new stuff. But yeah, this has a long way to go. They do have a roadmap, actually. I'll say. They've shared it. There's some decent stuff on there, including number sharing, but that also has no date and no other information. So I'll just say, good luck. Godspeed. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.

okay, there seems like a lot of overlap between what this is and what a smartphone can do.", "But everything that this pin does, a modern smartphone does better and faster, and easier and in higher quality, and just better in every way.", "Like your smartphone obviously takes better pictures and videos, and you can frame things more easily.", "Of course, a phone can call and text people more easily.", "You can use it in more places, loud places, private places, use it with literally any outfit.", "Also, a phone, like you can quickly Google things, it's faster to message people back.", "And of course, it can email people, and use all kinds of app experiences.", "Do you know what happens when you try to just send someone a picture from the AI Pin?", "You already know how to do it on your phone.", "With the AI Pin, okay, you take the picture, then you either try this with your voice, or you pull up the picture, which is just a green 720p jpeg on your hand.", "I guess that's a good enough preview, sure.", "You go to send it, you pick your contact, or type in the whole phone number with the gestures.", "Eventually, you go to send, and it has its own internet connection, and it sends a link to view the picture in the Humane web portal.", "Like the difference in how easy, how frictionless that is here versus here, it's not even close.", "And there are honestly many times where I'd be trusting this pin, like I'm reviewing it, I'm living that life, I'm using it, and I'd ask it something, and I would wait so long, and my phone would just be sitting right there, where I could just pick it up and Google the answer in the time it takes me to get hopefully the right answer on the pin.", "It's just...", "Phones are OP.", "(AI Pin beeps) Look and tell me what this is.",

you call an Uber, and you say, \"Take me to the studio from an Uber.\" Even if it could do that, which it can't, but let's say it could.", "And as you're waiting, you're like, \"I'm gonna just go grab a snack from this Starbucks on the corner.\" How do you adjust your pickup location with this?", "Ugh.", "Just that friction of, I could just do it in two seconds on my phone.", "Or buying something online is another one.", "I've seen a lot of demos where someone's like, \"Plan me a trip to Europe.", "Plan me an expedition.\" I don't even wanna buy detergent online on this, because I need to check all the ratings and the titles, and make sure I'm ordering the right one.", "I do not trust that with just my voice.", "But I think most critically, for the AI assistant part...", "I actually love the idea of a virtual assistant that you can talk to like a human.", "Like this is something we've been chasing for years with Google Assistant, and Siri and Alexa.", "And now with this new form factor of, you know, a little AI in a box that can be with you everywhere, maybe that can deliver even better on that specific promise, But the thing about a good assistant is it needs to know everything about you.", "That's even true with a human assistant.", "Like, it needs to know your schedule, it needs to know where you go every day, it needs to know who you talk to, who your preferences are personally and for products.", "Like it needs to know everything about you.", "And your smartphone already knows a lot of things about you.", "But this is a standalone device that doesn't talk to your phone, and so it doesn't know any of the things about you that your phone knows.", "So just from that, it's already at such a massive disadvantage for the smartphone for being helpful.", "I mean, you can do what I did.", "Fully immerse yourself for several days straight, and tell it to remember everything, and call people, text people from it, but it will always have that gap.", "And that's not even mentioning this, like I said, it has its own phone number, and so if you text people and call people from this, yeah, it can summarize all of your messages from the day, and all that stuff from these conversations, but it doesn't see any of these conversations.", "So if you're texting here, this is not the same thread.", "That gap is always gonna be there.", "So I guess that begs the question, why didn't they just make this connect to your phone?", "Everyone has a phone.", "That's the question that I think a lot of people are wondering.", "And I think...", "This is my theory, but I think Humane wants this thing to eventually be a very powerful standalone device someday.", "And in order to get it to that future, they can't set the precedent now of connecting it to your phone, 'cause then that means they have to remove that feature in the future, and they don't wanna do that.", "So this device as it exists today is hamstrung by its ideal future version of itself.", "It's like Vision Pro.", "Like I talked about it in the Vision Pro review.", "It doesn't actually pair to your iPhone in any way.", "It's its own standalone computer.", "And of course, Apple sees down the road, that could just be like a little pair of smart glasses.", "You don't need an iPhone to use that.", "But now, today, this thing is a victim of its future ambition.", "(mellow instrumental music) It was really hard to come up with a title for this video, but I will say, at one point, my working title for this was, \"This product is either the dumbest thing ever, or

and I'd get it.", "And I'd really feel like that's how it's supposed to feel, and I'd do another request, and it would remind me of reality.", "But here's an example, right?", "I've said a thousand times, like, my best ideas, golden rule, they always show up when I can't write them down.", "Like when I'm about to fall asleep, or I'm in the shower, or driving, right?", "So I'm using the pin, I'm

want to distract myself while driving taking a video, but you know, even though the quality's not great, that's the most frictionless version of that, along with smart glasses.", "That's great.", "And I think number one, on top of all of this, is if you ask me like, \"Who should buy this device right now?\" I mean, nobody should buy this device right now.", "But if there's one person who would most consider it, it's the person that wants to spend as little time as possible with a screen in their hands.", "Like as little time as possible on their phone.", "And that's me sometimes.", "I don't wanna doom scroll the second I pull my phone out of my pocket.", "For that person, if they want that at the expense of everything else, this device represents just a glimmer of hope for that future.",

goal of less screen time and living in the moment.", "But yeah, that's the issue with it.", "I literally had a moment, like we did a shoot in Ohio the other day, which was like a travel day.", "And I woke up in the morning and I thought like, \"I don't want to deal with this pin today.\" Like I have driving, so the seat belt's gonna be annoying, and then we're gonna go to the airport, and then probably gotta take it off through the metal detector and then put it on again, which means I have to log in with the pin again and...", "Just all this, and I just was like, \"I don't wanna have to charge this seven times.", "Like , I don't wanna wear it today.\" So I skipped it.", "And you should probably skip this product too.", "And never buy a product based on the future promise of updates

R W Reviewer: Zsófia Herczeg It isn’t true what they say, that you can’t love anyone until you love yourself. Have you heard that? People say you have to learn to love yourself before you can love anybody else. But it’s not true. I loved everybody before I loved myself. Love doesn’t care which way you come or what state you’re in when you get here. Love welcomes everyone unconditionally. Oddly, so do focus group moderators - (Laughter) which is how and why I learned to do it. If you’ve never been a part of a focus group, you’re missing a really special cultural experience. So, in every focus group, there’s a range of characters, right? There’s always a shy one and a chatty one, a grumpy one that doesn’t want to do any of the exercises, and a very excited mom with a notebook, who wants to get an A plus in all of the exercises. (Laughter) There’s a student who lied on the intake because they need the money, and a dad full of jokes who can’t read the room. (Laughter) And usually, there’s one ex-military guy who keeps staring at the two-way mirror suspiciously. (Laughter) It’s a situation where a group of people that may not otherwise ever meet have the chance to share their perspectives. And it’s my job as the moderator to make sure that they all get heard. Now, it’s not quite a classroom. It’s not group therapy. And while the community feel has some elements of holiness, probably no one would call it a spiritual experience. I mean, no one else. Because moderating rooms of strange and difficult voices is what taught me to welcome all the strange and difficult parts of myself. No kidding. I start every morning meditation with the same opener I use as a focus group moderator: “Thanks, everyone, for being here.” (Laughter) “Your input is valued.” (Laughter) “I’m going to hear from each of you. I’ll give you all the chance to speak. Just do your best to be completely present, honest, and try to make any requests reasonable.” So I don’t know about you, but there are a lot of me in here, in the mind of Karen Faith. I’m not referring to psychiatric illness specifically, but I don’t exclude that. (Laughter) My mind has plenty of quirks, but what I have to share is for anyone with an inner dialogue. Though I admit, it’s especially for those of us with a really noisy one. So I noticed some time ago that I was arguing with myself. And then I wondered: If I didn’t agree with me, who is I, and who is me in that scenario? And it turned out that there are quite a few of me. There’s a really sentimental, emotional me, an intellectual, analytical me. Those two argue a lot. There’s a me who loves being on stage. There’s another one who is pretty shaky at the moment. Some of us - at this time, I include you - some of us regard these as feelings or thoughts. And maybe we’ve done our personal homework, accepting that we can have conflicting feelings at the same time. We can be excited about a new job and also dread going back to work. We can be tired and want to stay up. We can adore someone who also annoys us. We can love someone who has badly betrayed us. We know this. And when we’re honest and rational, we can see that these are common experiences. But we’re not crazy to both love and hate camping. (Laughter) It does me no harm to embrace that I feel both ways about it. But what about the thought that I’m worthless, that I don’t belong here? The mistakes I’ve made are unforgivable, that the bad things that happened in my life were my fault. Those thoughts are just as real as the rest of them, but they're harder to live with. And they send many of us to therapy or to yoga or the nearest bar, which more or less describes my daily commute for many years. (Laughter) Because I wanted to silence those thoughts completely. And let me tell you: I tried. I have done every kind of therapy I have ever heard of. I have done talk therapy, energy healing, body work, hypnotherapy, soul retrieval, the tapping stuff, the thing with the lights. I did seven kinds of yoga. I drank the “special tea” with the shaman in the forest. (Laughter) I admit I did pass on the acupuncture they do with live honeybees - (Laughter) people do that. (Laughter) Suffice to say, I tried. And still sometimes, when I was alone, I would hear myself shouting: “Shut up!” or worse to my own mind. In my work as a people researcher, it’s my job to practice empathy with strangers, to receive everything I can about their world in order to understand them as deeply as possible. Now, it’s noteworthy that I found this career at a temp job, writing meeting notes, when my supervisor noticed that I wasn’t just paraphrasing conversation, I was recording body language, micro-expressions, tonal shifts, specific verb choices. What neither of us knew then is that the qualities which made me seem skillful were the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress. The most reasonable results of an appalling upbringing, and a fact I share not to set me apart from you but to welcome you in here with me. Everyone in this room has walked through something difficult in order to be here. And I want you to know that whatever path you’ve taken to get through it is honorable. Whether you never talk about it, or you write bad poetry about it, whether you make tons of money prosecuting it, or if you just hit the gym like a champ to sweat it out of your body, there is truly no wrong way. There are some ways that cause other problems. You know the ones. (Laughter) I’ve done some of those. I still do some of those. And I don’t judge those either, because gifts and curses are “buy one, get one.” And mine were no exception. My early life gave me heaps of shame and a splintered sense of self - hence all the different mes - but it also gave me super antennas for the emotions of others. This hypervigilance made me a certified mess of a person but a damn near-wizard-level observer. So I got to work. The last 20 years I’ve shadowed people in their homes, at their jobs, while they shop and drive, and go on dates. I ask them to be honest and vulnerable with me, and to do this, I practice something that I call unconditional welcome, which is like a researcher’s neutrality, but a little extra. The day I discovered it, I was sitting in the living room of a research subject. She was a very unpleasant woman, if I’m honest. Feeding french fries to an infant, as she snapped at me that she would never have her children vaccinated, not even to protect them from polio because she didn’t know it was in those shots. Now never mind that she said this an inch of ash deep into a Virginia Slim, right. (Laughter) I was judging her, I know. I’m not proud of it, but at least one of me is a jerk. (Laughter) I needed to connect with her, and I didn’t want to. I didn't like her. I didn't respect her. I didn’t want to spend a single moment with her. And the project required that I spend hours. And that I used that time to get to know her: what she values, what she believes, where she finds strength. Researcher neutrality was unavailable to me at the time, so I had to get out the big guns. I called up my New Age visualization skills, and I took a deep breath, secondhand smoke and all. And I imagined that my breath was inflating a shiny soap bubble filled with unconditional welcome. Not tolerance. Not even compassion. Total welcome as is - no comments, no notes. And as I inflated the bubble, it became big enough to contain my whole body. And then hers. And in that moment, I saw a mother feeding her baby in a world that she didn’t trust. I told her that I could see that she cared about protecting her son, and I asked her if she got that from her parents. And then we had a conversation. And I learned about her. I learned why she was afraid and angry, and how she fought through that fear to make a family. When I welcomed this woman unconditionally, I saw her more clearly, but I also loved her instantly. We have been told too often that love is hard. It’s not. Love is what happens when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it. It’s right there when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it, and we welcome someone, anyone, exactly as they are, in the moment. It’ll be two more years before I learn to do this with all the parts of myself. But it started just as simply; a part of me had become very chatty - a part that was afraid and angry, whiny, demanding, unreasonable and relentless. She told me that we were never going to get better. She wanted out of here. I asked her what I could do. She only told me she wanted to die, over and over and over and over. I begged her to shut up, and she did not. Finally, after weeks of harassment, whether out of exhaustion or epiphany, instead of shouting back, I took a deep breath. I became my own moderator. I said out loud in a voice that surprised me: “Thank you for sharing. I’m going to remind you of our agreement to be honest and reasonable.” And she answered me - that voice. Now, don’t get spooked. This is all just thinking happening. (Laughter) But the part of me asking and the part answering did in fact seem like different parts. She told me that she was in a lot of pain. And I told her: “I know. And I promise you I’m going to take care of you. But I need you to get on board. I will listen to you, but I will not obey you.” And as clearly as I’m speaking to you now, she said okay. And then we started to talk. As I continue the dialogue with myself, I found more of me, more voices with more points of view, some of them more fun than others. And the imagined landscape of my mind began to look a lot like a focus group. This round table of wildly mixed characters and one moderator keeping some kind of order with honesty, boundaries, kindness, and most importantly, gratitude. I thank my selves for their contributions. No matter how bonkers or twisted they may seem, because we’re all me. I think of my fragmented self less like broken mirror and more like a prism. We’re full spectrum. Today, there isn’t a voice in my head that I don’t welcome. And while some of us are occasionally unreasonable, we’re not mean. Even my whiny, shamey voice is trying to help in her weird way. But when I ask her to be clear and kind, she tells me exactly what I need to know: what she needs to feel better and what she’d like for me to learn. But just like the scared and angry mother, she only does this when I accept her exactly as she is in the moment. So while my openings for self-talk and focus groups sound almost identical, the closings are a little different. At the round table, I would hand out parking validation, remind everyone to sign for their cash, but when I’m with all of me, I say: “I love you. Thank you for helping me see what you see” - which is why this practice is so useful for all of us here with our different perspectives, inside and outside of one another. If we can receive one another with the curiosity and welcome of a focus group moderator, perhaps we can do a better job of love. Because it is not true what they say: that you can’t love anyone until you love yourself. Love is a house you can crawl in through a window. If you can’t start with yourself, start with the person next to you right now whether you know them or not. All you have to do is let them be here. It's easy, isn't it? Wherever they’ve been, whatever they’re carrying, whatever talents they have or don’t have, whatever mistakes they’ve made, can you just welcome them here? Can you welcome you? We’re here right now, like this. We’re beautiful and strange and complicated and scared and sometimes kind of horrible. But all of us are worthy of welcome. And everyone that you show unconditional welcome may show you a part of yourself to love. You are welcome. Thank you.

with the lights.", "I did seven kinds of yoga.", "I drank the “special tea” with the shaman in the forest.", "(Laughter) I admit I did pass on the acupuncture they do with live honeybees - (Laughter) people do that.", "(Laughter) Suffice to say, I tried.", "And still sometimes, when I was alone, I would hear myself shouting: “Shut up!” or worse to my own mind.", "In my work as a people researcher, it’s my job to practice empathy with strangers, to receive everything I can about their world in order to understand them as deeply as possible.", "Now, it’s noteworthy that I found this career at a temp job, writing meeting notes, when my supervisor noticed that I wasn’t just paraphrasing conversation, I was recording body language, micro-expressions, tonal shifts, specific verb choices.", "What neither of us knew then is that the qualities which made me seem skillful were the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress.", "The most reasonable results of an appalling upbringing, and a fact I share not to set me apart from you but to welcome you in here with me.", "Everyone in this room has walked through something difficult in order to be here.", "And I want you to know that whatever path

those.", "And I don’t judge those either, because gifts and curses are “buy one, get one.” And mine were no exception.", "My early life gave me heaps of shame and a splintered sense of self - hence all the different mes - but it also gave me super antennas for the emotions of others.", "This hypervigilance made me a certified mess of a person but a damn near-wizard-level observer.", "So I got to work.", "The last 20 years I’ve shadowed people in their homes, at their jobs, while they shop and drive, and go on dates.", "I ask them to be honest and vulnerable with me, and to do this, I practice something that I call unconditional welcome, which is like a researcher’s neutrality, but a little extra.", "The day I discovered it, I was sitting in the living room of a research subject.", "She was a very unpleasant woman, if I’m honest.", "Feeding french fries to an infant, as she snapped at me that she would never have her children vaccinated, not even to protect them from polio because she didn’t know it was in those shots.", "Now never mind that she said this an inch of ash deep into a Virginia Slim, right.", "(Laughter) I was judging her, I know.", "I’m not proud of it, but at least one of me is a jerk.", "(Laughter) I needed to connect with her, and I didn’t want to.", "I didn't like her.", "I didn't respect her.", "I didn’t want to spend a single moment with her.", "And the project required that I spend hours.", "And that I used that time to get to know her: what she values, what she believes, where she finds strength.", "Researcher neutrality was unavailable to me at the time, so I had to get out the big guns.", "I called up my New Age visualization skills, and I took a deep breath, secondhand smoke and all.", "And I imagined that my breath was inflating a shiny soap bubble filled with unconditional welcome.", "Not tolerance.", "Not even compassion.", "Total welcome as is - no comments, no notes.", "And as I inflated the bubble, it became big enough to contain my whole body.", "And then hers.", "And in that moment, I saw a mother feeding her baby in a world that she didn’t trust.", "I told her that I could see that she cared about protecting her son, and I asked her if she got that from her parents.", "And then we had a conversation.", "And I learned about her.", "I learned why she was afraid and angry, and how she fought through that fear to make a family.", "When I welcomed this woman unconditionally, I saw her more clearly, but I also loved her instantly.", "We have been told too often that love is hard.", "It’s not.", "Love is what happens when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it.", "It’s right there when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it, and we welcome someone, anyone, exactly as they are, in the moment.", "It’ll be two more years before I learn to do this with all the parts of myself.", "But it started just as simply; a part of me had become very chatty - a part that was afraid and angry, whiny, demanding, unreasonable and relentless.", "She told me that we were never going to get better.", "She wanted out of here.", "I asked her what I could do.", "She only told me she wanted to die, over and over and over and over.", "I begged her to shut up, and she did not.", "Finally, after weeks of harassment, whether out of exhaustion or epiphany, instead of shouting back, I took a deep breath.", "I became my own moderator.", "I said out loud in a voice that surprised me: “Thank you for sharing.", "I’m going to remind you of our agreement to be honest and reasonable.” And she answered me - that voice.", "Now, don’t get spooked.", "This is all just thinking happening.", "(Laughter) But the part of me asking and the part answering did in fact seem like different parts.", "She told me that she was in a lot of pain.", "And I told her: “I know.", "And I promise you I’m going to take care of you.", "But I need you to get on board.", "I will listen to you, but I will not obey you.” And as clearly as I’m speaking to you now, she said okay.", "And then we started to talk.", "As I continue the dialogue with myself, I found more of me, more voices with more points of view, some of them more fun than others.", "And the imagined landscape of my mind began to look a lot like a focus group.", "This round table of wildly mixed characters and one moderator keeping some kind of order with honesty, boundaries, kindness, and most importantly, gratitude.", "I thank my selves for their contributions.", "No matter how bonkers or twisted they may seem, because we’re all me.", "I think of my fragmented self less like broken mirror and more like a prism.", "We’re full spectrum.", "Today, there isn’t a voice in my head that I don’t welcome.", "And while some of us are occasionally unreasonable, we’re not mean.", "Even my whiny, shamey voice is trying to help in her weird way.", "But when I ask her to be clear and kind, she tells me exactly what I need to know: what she needs to feel better and what she’d like for me to learn.", "But just like the scared and angry mother, she only does this when I accept her exactly as she is in the moment.", "So while my openings for self-talk and focus groups sound almost identical, the closings are a little different.", "At the round table, I would hand out parking validation, remind everyone to sign for their cash, but when I’m with all of me, I say: “I love you.", "Thank you for helping me see what you see” - which is why this practice is so useful for all of us here with our different perspectives, inside and outside of one another.", "If we can receive one another with the curiosity and welcome of a focus group moderator, perhaps we can do a better job of love.", "Because it is not true what they say: that you can’t love anyone until you love yourself.", "Love is a house you can crawl in through a window.", "If you can’t start with yourself, start with the person next to you right now whether you know them or not.", "All you have to do is let them be here.", "It's easy, isn't it?", "Wherever they’ve been, whatever they’re carrying, whatever talents they have or don’t have, whatever mistakes they’ve made, can you just welcome them here?", "Can you welcome you?", "We’re here right now, like this.", "We’re beautiful and strange and complicated and scared and sometimes kind of horrible.", "But all of us are worthy of welcome.", "And everyone that you show unconditional welcome may show you a part of yourself to love.", "You are welcome.", "Thank you.", "(Applause)"], "transcript": [{"start": 0.0,

an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United States. In high doses, it affects brain development, the immune system, hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a 20-year difference in life expectancy. And yet, doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment. Now, the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical. It's childhood trauma. Okay. What kind of trauma am I talking about here? I'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game. I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology: things like abuse or neglect, or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence. Now, for a long time, I viewed these things in the way I was trained to view them, either as a social problem -- refer to social services -- or as a mental health problem -- refer to mental health services. And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach. When I finished my residency, I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed, someplace where I could make a difference. So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center, one of the best private hospitals in Northern California, and together, we opened a clinic in Bayview-Hunters Point, one of the poorest, most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco. Now, prior to that point, there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than 10,000 children, so we hung a shingle, and we were able to provide top-quality care regardless of ability to pay. It was so cool. We targeted the typical health disparities: access to care, immunization rates, asthma hospitalization rates, and we hit all of our numbers. We felt very proud of ourselves. But then I started noticing a disturbing trend. A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but when I actually did a thorough history and physical, what I found was that for most of my patients, I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD. Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on. Somehow I was missing something important. Now, before I did my residency, I did a master's degree in public health, and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well, and 98 of them develop diarrhea, you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics, or you can walk over and say, \"What the hell is in this well?\" So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. And then one day, my colleague walked into my office, and he said, \"Dr. Burke, have you seen this?\" In his hand was a copy of a research study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study. That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about. It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC, and together, they asked 17,500 adults about their history of exposure to what they called \"adverse childhood experiences,\" or ACEs. Those include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; physical or emotional neglect; parental mental illness, substance dependence, incarceration; parental separation or divorce; or domestic violence. For every yes, you would get a point on your ACE score. And then what they did was they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes. What they found was striking. Two things: Number one, ACEs are incredibly common. Sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ACE, and 12.6 percent, one in eight, had four or more ACEs. The second thing that they found was that there was a dose-response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes: the higher your ACE score, the worse your health outcomes. For a person with an ACE score of four or more, their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero. For hepatitis, it was also two and a half times. For depression, it was four and a half times. For suicidality, it was 12 times. A person with an ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease, the number one killer in the United States of America. Well, of course this makes sense. Some people looked at this data and they said, \"Come on. You have a rough childhood, you're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health. This isn't science. This is just bad behavior.\" It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in. We now understand better than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens, the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence. It inhibits the prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for impulse control and executive function, a critical area for learning. And on MRI scans, we see measurable differences in the amygdala, the brain's fear response center. So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high-risk behavior, and that's important to know. But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior, you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer. The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight-or-flight response. How does it work? Well, imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear. Immediately, your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary, which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says, \"Release stress hormones! Adrenaline! Cortisol!\" And so your heart starts to pound, Your pupils dilate, your airways open up, and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear. And that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear. (Laughter) But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night, and this system is activated over and over and over again, and it goes from being adaptive, or life-saving, to maladaptive, or health-damaging. Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation, because their brains and bodies are just developing. High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function, they affect the developing immune system, developing hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. So for me, this information threw my old training out the window, because when we understand the mechanism of a disease, when we know not only which pathways are disrupted, but how, then as doctors, it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment. That's what we do. So in San Francisco, we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent, screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress. We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical, because I know that if my patient has an ACE score of 4, she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD, she's four and half times as likely to become depressed, and she's 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs. I know that when she's in my exam room. For our patients who do screen positive, we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices, including home visits, care coordination, mental health care, nutrition, holistic interventions, and yes, medication when necessary. But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets, or lead poisoning, and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment, given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems. So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops, because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview. I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this, it would be routine screening, multi-disciplinary treatment teams, and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols. Yeah. That did not happen. And that was a huge learning for me. What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement. In the words of Dr. Robert Block, the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, \"Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.\" And for a lot of people, that's a terrifying prospect. The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it. But for me, that's actually where the hopes lies, because when we have the right framework, when we recognize this to be a public health crisis, then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions. From tobacco to lead poisoning to HIV/AIDS, the United States actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems, but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment, and when I look at what our nation's response has been so far, I wonder, why haven't we taken this more seriously? You know, at first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us. That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods. Which is weird, because the data doesn't bear that out. The original ACEs study was done in a population that was 70 percent Caucasian, 70 percent college-educated. But then, the more I talked to folks, I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards. If I were to ask how many people in this room grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness, I bet a few hands would go up. And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much, or who really believed that if you spare the rod, you spoil the child, I bet a few more hands would go up. Even in this room, this is an issue that touches many of us, and I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us. Maybe it's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it. We'd rather be sick. Fortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities make that option less viable every day. The science is clear: Early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime. Today, we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death, and 30 years from now, the child who has a high ACE score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized, whose asthma management is not connected, and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS. People will look at that situation and say, \"What the heck happened there?\" This is treatable. This is beatable. The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say, this is real and this is all of us. I believe that we are the movement. Thank you. (Applause)", "sentences": ["In the mid-'90s, the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United States.", "In high doses, it affects brain development, the immune system, hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.", "Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a 20-year difference in life expectancy.", "And yet, doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment.", "Now, the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.", "It's childhood trauma.", "Okay.", "What kind of trauma am I talking about here?", "I'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game.", "I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology: things like abuse or neglect, or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence.", "Now, for a long time, I viewed these things in the way I was trained to view them, either as a social problem -- refer to social services -- or as a mental health problem -- refer to mental health services.", "And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach.", "When I finished my residency, I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed, someplace where I could make a difference.", "So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center, one of the best private hospitals in Northern California, and together, we opened a clinic in Bayview-Hunters Point, one of the poorest, most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco.", "Now, prior to that point, there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than 10,000 children, so we hung a shingle, and we were able to provide top-quality care regardless of ability to pay.", "It was so cool.", "We targeted the typical health disparities: access to care, immunization rates, asthma hospitalization rates, and we hit all of our numbers.", "We felt very proud of ourselves.", "But then I started noticing a disturbing trend.", "A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but when I actually did a thorough history and physical, what I found was that for most of my patients, I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.", "Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on.", "Somehow I was missing something important.", "Now, before I did my residency, I did a master's degree in public health, and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well, and 98 of them develop diarrhea, you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics, or you can walk over and say, \"What the hell is in this well?\" So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children.", "And then one day, my colleague walked into my office, and he said, \"Dr.", "Burke, have you seen this?\" In his hand was a copy of a research study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study.", "That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career.", "The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about.", "It was done by Dr.", "Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr.", "Bob Anda at the CDC, and together, they asked 17,500 adults about their history of exposure to what they called \"adverse childhood experiences,\" or ACEs.", "Those include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; physical or emotional neglect; parental mental illness, substance dependence, incarceration; parental separation or divorce; or domestic violence.", "For every yes, you would get a point on your ACE score.", "And then what they did was they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes.", "What they found was striking.", "Two things: Number one, ACEs are incredibly common.", "Sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ACE, and 12.6 percent, one in eight, had four or more ACEs.", "The second thing that they found was that there was a dose-response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes: the higher your ACE score, the worse your health outcomes.", "For a person with an ACE score of four or more, their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero.", "For hepatitis, it was also two and a half times.", "For depression, it was four and a half times.", "For suicidality, it was 12 times.", "A person with an ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease, the number one killer in the United States of America.", "Well, of course this makes sense.", "Some people looked at this data and they said, \"Come on.", "You have a rough childhood, you're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health.", "This isn't science.", "This is just bad behavior.\" It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in.", "We now understand better than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children.", "It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens, the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence.", "It inhibits the prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for impulse control and executive function, a critical area for learning.", "And on MRI scans, we see measurable differences in the amygdala, the brain's fear response center.", "So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high-risk behavior, and that's important to know.", "But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior, you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer.", "The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight-or-flight response.", "How does it work?", "Well, imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear.", "Immediately, your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary, which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says, \"Release stress hormones!", "Adrenaline!", "Cortisol!\" And so your heart starts to pound, Your pupils dilate, your airways open up, and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear.", "And that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear.", "(Laughter) But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night, and this system is activated over and over and over again, and it goes from being adaptive, or life-saving, to maladaptive, or health-damaging.", "Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation, because their brains and bodies are just developing.", "High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function, they affect the developing immune system, developing hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.", "So for me, this information threw my old training out the window, because when we understand the mechanism of a disease, when we know not only which pathways are disrupted, but how, then as doctors, it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment.", "That's what we do.", "So in San Francisco, we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent, screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress.", "We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical, because I know that if my patient has an ACE score of 4, she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD, she's four and half times as likely to become depressed, and she's 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs.", "I know that when she's in my exam room.", "For our patients who do screen positive, we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices, including home visits, care coordination, mental health care, nutrition, holistic interventions, and yes, medication when necessary.", "But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets, or lead poisoning, and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment, given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems.", "So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops, because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview.", "I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this, it would be routine screening, multi-disciplinary treatment teams, and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols.", "Yeah.", "That did not happen.", "And that was a huge learning for me.", "What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement.", "In the words of Dr.", "Robert Block, the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, \"Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.\" And for a lot of people, that's a terrifying prospect.", "The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it.", "But for me, that's actually where the hopes lies, because when we have the right framework, when we recognize this to be a public health crisis, then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions.", "From tobacco to lead poisoning to HIV/AIDS, the United States actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems, but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment, and when I look at what our nation's response has been so far, I wonder, why haven't we taken this more seriously?", "You know, at first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us.", "That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods.", "Which is weird, because the data doesn't bear that out.", "The original ACEs study was done in a population that was 70 percent Caucasian, 70 percent college-educated.", "But then, the more I talked to folks, I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards.", "If I were to ask how many people in this room grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness, I bet a few hands would go up.", "And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much, or who really believed that if you spare the rod, you spoil the child, I bet a few more hands would go up.", "Even in this room, this is an issue that touches many of us, and I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us.", "Maybe it's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it.", "We'd rather be sick.", "Fortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities make that option less viable every day.", "The science is clear: Early adversity dramatically affects health across a

not be the same | Lara Boyd | TEDxVancouver", "language": "en", "content": "Translator: Jessica Lee Reviewer: Denise RQ So how do we learn? And why does some of us learn things more easily than others? So, as I just mentioned, I'm Dr. Lara Boyd. I am a brain researcher here at the University of British Columbia. These are the questions that fascinate me. (Cheers) (Applause) So brain research is one of the great frontiers in the understanding of human physiology, and also in the consideration of what makes us who we are. It's an amazing time to be a brain researcher, and I would argue to you that I have the most interesting job in the world. What we know about the brain is changing at a breathtaking pace. And much of what we thought we knew and understood about the brain turns out to be not true or incomplete. Some of these misconceptions are more obvious than others. For example, we used to think that after childhood the brain did not, really could not change. And it turns out that nothing could be farther from the truth. Another misconception about the brain is that you only use parts of it at any given time and it's silent when you do nothing. Well, this is also untrue. It turns out that even when you're at a rest and thinking of nothing, your brain is highly active. So it's been advances in technology, such as MRI, that's allowed us to make these and many other important discoveries. And perhaps the most exciting, the most interesting and transformative of these discoveries is that, every time you learn a new fact or skill, you change your brain. It's something we call neuroplasticity. So as little as 25 years ago, we thought that after about puberty, the only changes that took place in the brain were negative: the loss of brain cells with aging, the result of damage, like a stroke. And then, studies began to show remarkable amounts of reorganization in the adult brain. And the ensuing research has shown us that all of our behaviors change our brain. That these changes are not limited by age, it's a good news right? And in fact, they are taking place all the time. And very importantly, brain reorganization helps to support recovery after you damage your brain. The key to each of these changes is neuroplasticity. So what does it look like? So your brain can change in three very basic ways to support learning. And the first is chemical. So your brain actually functions by transferring chemicals signals between brain cells, what we call neurons, and this triggered a series of actions and reactions. So to support learning, your brain can increase the amount or the concentrations of these chemical signaling that's taking place between neurons. Because this change can happen rapidly, this supports short-term memory or the short-term improvement in the performance of a motor skill. The second way that the brain can change to support learning is by altering its structure. So during learning, the brain can change the connections between neurons. Here, the physical structure of the brain is actually changing so this takes a bit more time. These type of changes are related to long-term memory, the long-term improvement in a motor skill. These processes interact, and let me give you an example of how. We've all tried to learn a new motor skill, maybe playing the piano, maybe learning to juggle. You've had the experience of getting better and better within a single session of practice, and thinking \"I have got it.\" And then, maybe you return the next day, and all those improvements from the day before are lost. What happened? Well, in the short-term, your brain was able to increase the chemical signaling between your neurons. But for some reason, those changes did not induce the structural changes that are necessary to support long-term memory. Remember that long-term memories take time. And what you see in the short term does not reflect learning, It's these physical changes that are now going to support long-term memories, and chemical changes that support short-term memories. Structural changes also can lead to integrated networks of brain regions that function together to support learning. And they can also lead to certain brain regions that are important for very specific behaviors to change your structure or to enlarge. So here's some examples of that. People who read Braille have larger hand sensory areas in their brain than those of us who don't. Your dominant hand motor region, which is on the left side of your brain, if you are right-handed, is larger than the other side. And research shows the London taxi cab drivers who actually have to memorize a map of London to get their taxi cab license, they have larger brain regions devoted to spatial, or mapping memories. The last way that your brain can change to support learning is by altering its function. As you use a brain region, It becomes more and more excitable and easy to use again. And as your brain has these areas that increase their excitability, the brain shifts how and when they are activated. With learning, we see that whole networks of brain activity are shifting and changing. So neuroplasticity is supported by chemical, by structural, and by functional changes, and these are happening across the whole brain. They can occur in isolation from one or another, but most often, they take place in concert. Together, they support learning. And they're taking place all the time. I just told you really how awesomely neuroplastic your brain is. Why can't you learn anything you choose to with ease? Why do our kids sometimes fail in school? Why as we age do we tend to forget things? And why don't people fully recover from brain damage? That is: what is it that limits and facilitates neuroplasticity? And so this is what I study. I study specifically how it relates to recovery from stroke. Recently, stroke dropped from being the third leading cause of death in the United States to be the forth leading cause of death. Great news, right? But actually, it turns out that the number of people having a stroke has not declined. We are just better at keeping people alive after a severe stroke. It turns out to be very difficult to help the brain recover from stroke. And frankly, we have failed to develop effective rehabilitation interventions. The net result of this is that stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in adults in the world; individuals with stroke are younger and tending to live longer with that disability, and research from my group actually shows that the health-related quality of life of Canadians with stroke has declined. So clearly we need to be better at helping people recover from stroke. This is an enormous societal problem, and it's one that we are not solving. So what can be done? One thing is absolutely clear: the best driver of neuroplastic change in your brain is your behavior. The problem is that the dose of behavior, the dose of practice that's required to learn new and relearn old motor skills, is very large. And how to effectively deliver these large doses of practice is a very difficult problem; It's also a very expensive problem. So the approach that my research has taken is to develop therapies that prime or that prepare the brain to learn. And these have included brain simulation, exercise, and robotics. But through my research, I've realized that a major limitation to the development of therapies that speed recovery from stroke is that patterns of neuroplasticity are highly variable from person to person. As a researcher, variability used to drive me crazy. It makes it very difficult to use the statistics to test your data and your ideas. And because of this, medical intervention studies are specifically designed to minimize variability. But in my research, it's becoming really clear that the most important, the most informative data we collect is showing this variability. So by studying the brain after stroke, we've learned a lot, and I think these lessons are very valuable in other areas. The first lesson is that the primary driver of change in your brain is your behavior, so there is no neuroplasticity drug you can take. Nothing is more effective than practice at helping you learn, and the bottom line is you have to do the work. And in fact, my research has shown increased difficulty, increased struggle if you will, during practice, actually leads to both more learning, and greater structural change in the brain. The problem here is that neuroplastcity can work both ways. It can be positive, you learn something new, and you refine a motor skill. And it also can be negative though, you forgot something you once knew, you become addicted to drugs, maybe you have chronic pain. So your brain is tremendously plastic, and it's been shaped both structurally and functionally by everything you do, but also by everything that you don't do. The second lesson we've learned about the brain is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to learning. So there is no recipe for learning. Consider the popular belief that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to learn and to master a new motor skill. I can assure you it's not quite that simple. For some of us, it's going to take a lot more practice, and for others it may take far less. So the shaping of our plastic brains is far too unique for there to be any single intervention that's going to work for all of us. This realization has forced us to consider something call personalized medicine. This is the idea that to optimize outcomes each individual requires their own intervention. And the idea actually comes from cancer treatments. And here it turns out that genetics are very important in matching certain types of chemotherapy with specific forms of cancer. My research is showing that this also applies to recovery from stroke. There're certain characteristics of brain structure and function we called biomarkers. And these biomarkers are proving to be very helpful and helping us to match specific therapies with individual patients. The data from my lab suggests it's a combination of biomarkers that best predicts neuroplastic change and patterns of recovery after stroke. And that's not surprising, given how complicated the human brain is. But I also think we can consider this concept much more broadly. Given the unique structure and function of each of our brains what we've learned about neuroplasticity after stroke applies to everyone. Behaviors that you employ in your everyday life are important. Each of them is changing your brain. And I believe we have to consider not just personalized medicine but personalized learning. The uniqueness of your brain will affect you both as a learner and also as a teacher. This idea helps us to understand why some children can thrive in tradition education settings and others don't; why some of us can learn languages easily and yet, others can pick up any sport and excel. So when you leave this room today, your brain will not be the same as when you entered this morning. And I think that's pretty amazing. But each of you is going to have changed your brain differently. Understanding these differences, these individual patterns, this variability and change is going to enable the next great advance in neuroscience; it's going to allow us to develop new and more effective interventions, and allow for matches between learners and teachers, and patients and interventions. And this does not just apply the recovery from stroke, it applies to each of us, as a parent, as a teacher, as a manager, and also because you are at TEDx today, as a lifelong learner. Study how and what you learn best. Repeat those behaviors that are healthy for your brain, and break those behaviors and habits that are not. Practice. Learning is about doing the work that your brain requires. So the best strategies are going to vary between individuals. You know what, they're even going to vary within individuals. So for you, learning music may come very easily, but learning to snowboard, much harder. I hope that you leave today with a new appreciation of how magnificent your brain is. You and your plastic brain are constantly being shaped by the world around you. Understand that everything you do, everything you encounter, and everything you experience is changing your brain. And that can be for better, but it can also be for worse. So when you leave today, go out and build the brain you want. Thank you very much.

nothing could be farther from the truth.", "Another misconception about the brain is that you only use parts of it at any given time and it's silent when you do nothing.", "Well, this is also untrue.", "It turns out that even when you're at a rest and thinking of nothing, your brain is highly active.", "So it's been advances in technology, such as MRI, that's allowed us to make these and many other important discoveries.", "And perhaps the most exciting, the most interesting and transformative of these discoveries is that, every time you learn a new fact or skill, you change your brain.", "It's something we call neuroplasticity.", "So as little as 25 years ago, we thought that after about puberty, the only changes that took place in the brain were negative: the loss of brain cells with aging, the result of damage, like a stroke.", "And then, studies began to show remarkable amounts of reorganization in the adult brain.", "And the ensuing research has shown us that all of our behaviors change our brain.", "That these changes are not limited by age, it's a good news right?", "And in fact, they are taking place all the time.", "And very importantly, brain reorganization helps to support recovery after you damage your brain.", "The key to each of these changes is neuroplasticity.", "So what does it look like?", "So your brain can change in three very basic ways to support learning.", "And the first is chemical.", "So your brain actually functions by transferring chemicals signals between brain cells, what we call neurons, and this triggered a series of actions and reactions.", "So to support learning, your brain can increase the amount or the concentrations of these chemical signaling that's taking place between neurons.", "Because this change can happen rapidly, this supports short-term memory or the short-term improvement in the performance of a motor skill.", "The second way that the brain can change to support learning is by altering its structure.", "So during learning, the brain can change the connections between neurons.", "Here, the physical structure of the brain is actually changing so this takes a bit more time.", "These type of changes are related to long-term memory, the long-term improvement in a motor skill.", "These processes interact, and let me give you an example of how.", "We've all tried to learn a new motor skill, maybe playing the piano, maybe learning to juggle.", "You've had the experience of getting better and better within a single session of practice, and thinking \"I have got it.\" And then, maybe you return the next day, and all those improvements from the day before are lost.", "What happened?", "Well, in the short-term, your brain was able to increase the chemical signaling between your neurons.", "But for some reason, those changes did not induce the structural changes that are necessary to support long-term memory.", "Remember that long-term memories take time.", "And what you see in the short term does not reflect learning, It's these physical changes that are now going to support long-term memories, and chemical changes that support short-term memories.", "Structural changes also can lead to integrated networks of brain regions that function together to support learning.", "And they can also lead to certain brain regions that are important for very specific behaviors to change your structure or to enlarge.", "So here's some examples of that.", "People who read Braille have larger hand sensory areas in their brain than those of us who don't.", "Your dominant hand motor region, which is on the left side of your brain, if you are right-handed, is larger than the other side.", "And research shows the London taxi cab drivers who actually have to memorize a map of London to get their taxi cab license, they have larger brain regions devoted to spatial, or mapping memories.", "The last way that your brain can change to support learning is by altering its function.", "As you use a brain region, It becomes more and more excitable and easy to use again.", "And as your brain has these areas that increase their excitability, the brain shifts how and when they are activated.", "With learning, we see that whole networks of brain activity are shifting and changing.", "So neuroplasticity is supported by chemical, by structural, and by functional changes, and these are happening across the whole brain.", "They can occur in isolation from one or another, but most often, they take place in concert.", "Together, they support learning.", "And they're taking place all the time.", "I just told you really how awesomely neuroplastic your brain is.", "Why can't you learn anything you choose to with ease?", "Why do our kids sometimes fail in school?", "Why as we age do we tend to forget things?", "And why don't people fully recover from brain damage?", "That is: what is it that limits and facilitates neuroplasticity?", "And so this is what I study.", "I study specifically how it relates to recovery from stroke.", "Recently, stroke dropped from being the third leading cause of death in the United States to be the forth leading cause of death.", "Great news, right?", "But actually, it turns out that the number of people having a stroke has not declined.", "We are just better at keeping people alive after a severe stroke.", "It turns out to be very difficult to help the brain recover from stroke.", "And frankly, we have failed to develop effective rehabilitation interventions.", "The net result of this is that stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in adults in the world; individuals with stroke are younger and tending to live longer with that disability, and research from my group actually shows that the health-related quality of life of Canadians with stroke has declined.", "So clearly we need to be better at helping people recover from stroke.", "This is an enormous societal problem, and it's one that we are not solving.", "So what can be done?", "One thing is absolutely clear: the best driver of neuroplastic change in your brain is your behavior.", "The problem is that the dose of behavior, the dose of practice that's required to learn new and relearn old motor skills, is very large.", "And how to effectively deliver these large doses of practice is a very difficult problem; It's also a very expensive problem.", "So the approach that my research has taken is to develop therapies that prime or that prepare the brain to learn.", "And these have included brain simulation, exercise, and robotics.", "But through my research, I've realized that a major limitation to the development of therapies that speed recovery from stroke is that patterns of neuroplasticity are highly variable from person to person.", "As a researcher, variability used to drive me crazy.", "It makes it very difficult to use the statistics to test your data and your ideas.", "And because of this, medical intervention studies are specifically designed to minimize variability.", "But in my research, it's becoming really clear that the most important, the most informative data we collect is showing this variability.", "So by studying the brain after stroke, we've learned a lot, and I think these lessons are very valuable in other areas.", "The first lesson is that the primary driver of change in your brain is your behavior, so there is no neuroplasticity drug you can take.", "Nothing is more effective than practice at helping you learn, and the bottom line is you have to do the work.", "And in fact, my research has shown increased difficulty, increased struggle if you will, during practice, actually leads to both more learning, and greater structural change in the brain.", "The problem here is that neuroplastcity can work both ways.", "It can be positive, you learn something new, and you refine a motor skill.", "And it also can be negative though, you forgot something you once knew, you become addicted to drugs, maybe you have chronic pain.", "So your brain is tremendously plastic, and it's been shaped both structurally and functionally by everything you do, but also by everything that you don't do.", "The second lesson we've learned about the brain is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to learning.", "So there is no recipe for learning.", "Consider the popular belief that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to learn and to master a new motor skill.", "I can assure you it's not quite that simple.", "For some of us, it's going to take a lot more practice, and for others it may take far less.", "So the shaping of our plastic brains is far too unique for there to be any single intervention that's going to work for all of us.", "This realization has forced us to consider something call personalized medicine.", "This is the idea that to optimize outcomes each individual requires their own intervention.", "And the idea actually comes from cancer treatments.", "And here it turns out that genetics are very important in matching certain types of chemotherapy with specific forms of cancer.", "My research is showing that this also applies to recovery from stroke.", "There're certain characteristics of brain structure and function we called biomarkers.", "And these biomarkers are proving to be very helpful and helping us to match specific therapies with individual patients.", "The data from my lab suggests it's a combination of biomarkers that best predicts neuroplastic change and patterns of recovery after stroke.", "And that's not surprising, given how complicated the human brain is.", "But I also think we can consider this concept much more broadly.", "Given the unique structure and function of each of our brains what we've learned about

addiction is wrong | Johann Hari | TED", "language": "en", "content": "One of my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to. And I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why, but as I got older, I realized we had drug addiction in my family, including later cocaine addiction. I'd been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain, and we then imposed that on the rest of the world. It's a century since we made this really fateful decision to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer, because we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop. And a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them. And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction? Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working, and is there a better way out there that we could try instead? So I read loads of stuff about it, and I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for, so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and see if I could learn from them. And I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people, from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them -- it turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances -- to the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal. And the thing I realized that really blew my mind is, almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong, and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction, I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies. But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew. Let's think about this middle row here. Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day. Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect. (Laughter) Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment. Imagine you did that, right? What would happen? Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century. We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right? That's what I thought. First thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me. If I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine. Diamorphine is heroin. It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated. Actually, very little of it is heroin, whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure. And you'll be given it for quite a long period of time. There are loads of people in this room, you may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin. And anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening. And if what we believe about addiction is right -- those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks -- What should happen? They should become addicts. This has been studied really carefully. It doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn't come out as a junkie. (Laughter) And when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander. He's a professor of psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment I think really helps us to understand this issue. Professor Alexander explained to me, the idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story, comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century. They're really simple. You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic. You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly. So there you go, right? That's how we think it works. In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something. He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage. It's got nothing to do except use these drugs. Let's try something different. So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called \"Rat Park,\" which is basically heaven for rats. They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls, they've got loads of tunnels. Crucially, they've got loads of friends. They can have loads of sex. And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water. But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water. They almost never use it. None of them ever use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives. Now, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought, maybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us. Maybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know -- But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time. It was called the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin, and if you look at the news reports from the time, they were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States when the war ends; it made total sense. Now, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home. The Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study, and what happened to them? It turns out they didn't go to rehab. They didn't go into withdrawal. Ninety-five percent of them just stopped. Now, if you believe the story about chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction. He said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks? What if addiction is about your cage? What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment? Looking at this, there was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction. Maybe we should call it bonding. Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other, but if you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief. Now, that might be gambling, that might be pornography, that might be cocaine, that might be cannabis, but you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature. That's what we want as human beings. And at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around, but one way that helped me to think about it is, I can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right? I'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you. Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war. Totally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right? We could all be getting drunk -- I might after this -- (Laughter) -- but we're not. Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months. You wouldn't end up homeless. You're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that is not because anyone's stopping you. It's because you've got bonds and connections that you want to be present for. You've got work you love. You've got people you love. You've got healthy relationships. And a core part of addiction, I came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests, is about not being able to bear to be present in your life. Now, this has really significant implications. The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs. In Arizona, I went out with a group of women who were made to wear t-shirts saying, \"I was a drug addict,\" and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them, and when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records that mean they'll never work in the legal economy again. Now, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang, but actually almost everywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that. We punish them. We shame them. We give them criminal records. We put barriers between them reconnecting. There was a doctor in Canada, Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system. Now, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite, and I went there to see how it worked. In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe. One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing, and every year, they tried the American way more and more. They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse. And one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together, and basically said, look, we can't go on with a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts. Let's set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem. And they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão, to look at all this new evidence, and they came back and they said, \"Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but\" -- and this is the crucial next step -- \"take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off, on disconnecting them, and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society.\" And that's not really what we think of as drug treatment in the United States and Britain. So they do do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy, that does have some value. But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do: a massive program of job creation for addicts, and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses. So say you used to be a mechanic. When you're ready, they'll go to a garage, and they'll say, if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages. The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning. And when I went and met the addicts in Portugal, what they said is, as they rediscovered purpose, they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society. It'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began, and the results are in: injecting drug use is down in Portugal, according to the British Journal of Criminology, by 50 percent, five-zero percent. Overdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts. Addiction in every study is significantly down. One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system. Now, that's the political implications. I actually think there's a layer of implications to all this research below that. We live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating. Before these talks began -- you guys know this -- we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on, and I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours. (Laughter) A lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say, I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction and weird to say it's growing, because you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely. But I increasingly began to think that the connections we have or think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection. If you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something. It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you. It won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round. It'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced and textured, face-to-face relationships with, and there's a study I learned about from Bill McKibben, the environmental writer, that I think tells us a lot about this. It looked at the number of close friends the average American believes they can call on in a crisis. That number has been declining steadily since the 1950s. The amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing, and I think that's like a metaphor for the choice we've made as a culture. We've traded floorspace for friends, we've traded stuff for connections, and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been. And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says, we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery, and it's right to talk about that, but we need to talk much more about social recovery. Something's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group, and we've created a society where, for a lot of us, life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park. If I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it. I didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff. I wanted to know how to help the people I love. And when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this, I looked at the addicts in my life, and if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict, and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room. You are angry a lot of the time, and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us, right? Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you. And the kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by, I think, the reality show \"Intervention,\" if you guys have ever seen it. I think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV, but that's another TED Talk. If you've ever seen the show \"Intervention,\" it's a pretty simple premise. Get an addict, all the people in their life, gather them together, confront them with what they're doing, and they say, if you don't shape up, we're going to cut you off. So what they do is they take the connection to the addict, and they threaten it, they make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want. And I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work, and I began to think that's almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War into our private lives. So I was thinking, how could I be Portuguese? And what I've tried to do now, and I can't tell you I do it consistently and I can't tell you it's easy, is to say to the addicts in my life that I want to deepen the connection with them, to say to them, I love you whether you're using or you're not. I love you, whatever state you're in, and if you need me, I'll come and sit with you because I love you and I don't want you to be alone or to feel alone. And I think the core of that message -- you're not alone, we love you -- has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually. For 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts. I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them, because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection. Thank you.

them suffer, because we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop.", "And a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them.", "And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction?", "Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working, and is there a better way out there that we could try instead?", "So I read loads of stuff about it, and I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for, so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and see if I could learn from them.", "And I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people, from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them -- it turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances -- to the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal.", "And the thing I realized that really blew my mind is, almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong, and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction, I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies.", "But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew.", "Let's think about this middle row here.", "Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day.", "Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect.", "(Laughter) Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment.", "Imagine you did that, right?", "What would happen?", "Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century.", "We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts.", "Right?", "That's what I thought.", "First thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me.", "If I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.", "Diamorphine is heroin.", "It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated.", "Actually, very little of it is heroin, whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure.", "And you'll be given it for quite a long period of time.", "There are loads of people in this room, you may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin.", "And anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening.", "And if what we believe about addiction is right -- those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks -- What should happen?", "They should become addicts.", "This has been studied really carefully.", "It doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn't come out as a junkie.", "(Laughter) And when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.", "He's a professor of psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment I think really helps us to understand this issue.", "Professor Alexander explained to me, the idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story, comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century.", "They're really simple.", "You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic.", "You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.", "If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly.", "So there you go, right?", "That's how we think it works.", "In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something.", "He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage.", "It's got nothing to do except use these drugs.", "Let's try something different.", "So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called \"Rat Park,\" which is basically heaven for rats.", "They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls, they've got loads of tunnels.", "Crucially, they've got loads of friends.", "They can have loads of sex.", "And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water.", "But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.", "They almost never use it.", "None of them ever use it compulsively.", "None of them ever overdose.", "You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives.", "Now, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought, maybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us.", "Maybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know -- But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time.", "It was called the Vietnam War.", "In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin, and if you look at the news reports from the time, they were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States when the war ends; it made total sense.", "Now, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home.", "The Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study, and what happened to them?", "It turns out they didn't go to rehab.", "They didn't go into withdrawal.", "Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.", "Now, if you believe the story about chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction.", "He said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks?", "What if addiction is about your cage?", "What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment?", "Looking at this, there was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction.", "Maybe we should call it bonding.", "Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other, but if you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief.", "Now, that might be gambling, that might be pornography, that might be cocaine, that might be cannabis, but you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature.", "That's what we want as human beings.", "And at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around, but one way that helped me to think about it is, I can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right?", "I'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you.", "Forget the drugs.", "Forget the drug war.", "Totally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right?", "We could all be getting drunk -- I might after this -- (Laughter) -- but we're not.", "Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months.", "You wouldn't end up homeless.", "You're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that is not because anyone's stopping you.", "It's because you've got bonds and connections that you want to be present for.", "You've got work you love.", "You've got people you love.", "You've got healthy relationships.", "And a core part of addiction, I came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests, is about not being able to bear to be present in your life.", "Now, this has really significant implications.", "The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs.", "In Arizona, I went out with a group of women who were made to wear t-shirts saying, \"I was a drug addict,\" and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them, and when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records that mean they'll never work in the legal economy again.", "Now, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang, but actually almost everywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that.", "We punish them.", "We shame them.", "We give them criminal records.", "We put barriers between them reconnecting.", "There was a doctor in Canada, Dr.", "Gabor Maté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system.", "Now, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite, and I went there to see how it worked.", "In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe.", "One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing, and every year, they tried the American way more and more.", "They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse.", "And one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got

| Matt Walker | TED", "language": "en", "content": "Thank you very much. Well, I would like to start with testicles. (Laughter) Men who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more. (Laughter) In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior. So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade in terms of that critical aspect of wellness. And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep. This is the best news that I have for you today. (Laughter) From this point, it may only get worse. Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough, both for your brain and for your body. Let me start with the brain and the functions of learning and memory, because what we've discovered over the past 10 or so years is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the save button on those new memories so that you don't forget. But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain, almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up new information. And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain essentially become waterlogged, as it were, and you can't absorb new memories. So let me show you the data. Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea. So we took a group of individuals and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups: a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group. Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber, but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake in the laboratory, under full supervision. There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved. And then the next day, we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts as we're taking snapshots of brain activity. And then we're going to test them to see how effective that learning has been. And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis. And when you put those two groups head to head, what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep. I think this should be concerning, considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now. In fact, to put that in context, it would be the difference in a child acing an exam versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent. And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain to produce these types of learning disabilities. And there's a structure that sits on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus. And you can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational inbox of your brain. It's very good at receiving new memory files and then holding on to them. And when you look at this structure in those people who'd had a full night of sleep, we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity. Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived, we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever. So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox, and any new incoming files -- they were just being bounced. You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory. So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you, but let me just come back to that control group for a second. Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep? Well, we can ask a very different question: What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep when you do get it that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability each and every day? And by placing electrodes all over the head, what we've discovered is that there are big, powerful brainwaves that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep that have riding on top of them these spectacular bursts of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles. And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night, shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain, and therefore protecting them, making them safe. And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits, because there are real medical and societal implications. And let me just tell you about one area that we've moved this work out into, clinically, which is the context of aging and dementia. Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older, our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline. But what we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing. And only last year, we finally published evidence that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring, they are significantly interrelated. And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep is an underappreciated factor that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline in aging, and most recently we've discovered, in Alzheimer's disease as well. Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news. It's in the mail. It's coming at you. But there's a potential silver lining here. Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging, for example changes in the physical structure of the brain, that's fiendishly difficult to treat. But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting because we may be able to do something about it. And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center is not by using sleeping pills, by the way. Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep. Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this. It's called direct current brain stimulation. You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain, so small you typically don't feel it, but it has a measurable impact. Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young, healthy adults, as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep-sleep brainwaves, not only can you amplify the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves, but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit that you get from sleep. The question now is whether we can translate this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology into older adults and those with dementia. Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep, and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning and memory function? That is my real hope now. That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were. So that's an example of sleep for your brain, but sleep is just as essential for your body. We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system. Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system, and that all it takes is one hour. Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight saving time. Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day. In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep, we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks. Isn't that incredible? And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates. But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this: sleep loss and your immune system. And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image. They are called natural killer cells, and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents of your immune system. They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements and eliminating them. In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass. So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times, and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough. So here in this experiment, you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night, you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours for one single night, and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer. And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent, it's not 20 percent. There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity. That's a concerning state of immune deficiency, and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding significant links between short sleep duration and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer. Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast. In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen, because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms. So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead. Well, I'm being quite serious now -- it is mortally unwise advice. We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals. There's a simple truth: the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality. And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer or even Alzheimer's disease were not sufficiently disquieting, we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA genetic code. So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night for one week, and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night. And there were two critical findings. First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity, caused by a lack of sleep. The second result was that about half of those genes were actually increased in their activity. The other half were decreased. Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with your immune system, so once again, you can see that immune deficiency. In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep, were genes associated with the promotion of tumors, genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body, and genes associated with stress, and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease. There is simply no aspect of your wellness that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed. It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home. Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology, even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out your daily health narrative. And at this point, you may be thinking, \"Oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep? What are you tips for good sleep?\" Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep, and if you're struggling with sleep at night, avoiding naps during the day, I have two pieces of advice for you. The first is regularity. Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time, no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend. Regularity is king, and it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep. The second is keep it cool. Your body needs to drop its core temperature by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep, and it's the reason you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees, or about 18 degrees Celsius. That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people. And then finally, in taking a step back, then, what is the mission-critical statement here? Well, I think it may be this: sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury. Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity. It is your life-support system, and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality. And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness, even the safety and the education of our children. It's a silent sleep loss epidemic, and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges that we face in the 21st century. I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep, and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laziness. And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life, the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were. And with that soapbox rant over, I will simply say, good night, good luck, and above all ... I do hope you sleep well. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. David Biello: No, no, no. Stay there for a second. Good job not running away, though. I appreciate that. So that was terrifying. Matt Walker: You're welcome. DB: Yes, thank you, thank you. Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do? What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else? MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep. Sleep is not like the bank. You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time. I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic and that our health deteriorates so quickly, first, it's because human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason. DB: Because we're smart. MW: And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature, throughout the course of evolution, has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation. So she's never developed a safety net, and that's why when you undersleep, things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body. So you just have to prioritize. DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed, what do I do? MW: So if you are staying in bed awake for too long, you should get out of bed and go to a different room and do something different. The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness, and you need to break that association. So only return to bed when you are sleepy, and that way you will relearn the association that you once had, which is your bed is the place of sleep. So the analogy would be, you'd never sit at the dinner table, waiting to get hungry, so why would you lie in bed, waiting to get sleepy? DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call. Great job, Matt. MW: You're very welcome.

but sleep is just as essential for your body.", "We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system.", "Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system, and that all it takes is one hour.", "Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight saving time.", "Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day.", "In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep, we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks.", "Isn't that incredible?", "And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates.", "But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this: sleep loss and your immune system.", "And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image.", "They are called natural killer cells, and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents of your immune system.", "They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements and eliminating them.", "In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.", "So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times, and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough.", "So here in this experiment, you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night, you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours for one single night, and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer.", "And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent, it's not 20 percent.", "There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity.", "That's a concerning state of immune deficiency, and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding significant links between short sleep duration and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer.", "Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast.", "In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen, because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms.", "So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead.", "Well, I'm being quite serious now -- it is mortally unwise advice.", "We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals.", "There's a simple truth: the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.", "Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.", "And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer or even Alzheimer's disease were not sufficiently disquieting, we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA genetic code.", "So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night for one week, and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night.", "And there were two critical findings.", "First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity, caused by a lack of sleep.", "The second result was that about half of those genes were actually increased in their activity.", "The other half were decreased.", "Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with your immune system, so once again, you can see that immune deficiency.", "In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep, were genes associated with the promotion of tumors, genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body, and genes associated with stress, and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.", "There is simply no aspect of your wellness that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed.", "It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home.", "Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology, even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out your daily health narrative.", "And at this point, you may be thinking, \"Oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep?", "What are you tips for good sleep?\" Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep, and if you're struggling with sleep at night, avoiding naps during the day, I have two pieces of advice for you.", "The first is regularity.", "Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time, no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend.", "Regularity is king, and it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep.", "The second is keep it cool.", "Your body needs to drop its core temperature by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep, and it's the reason you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot.", "So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees, or about 18 degrees Celsius.", "That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people.", "And then finally, in taking a step back, then, what is the mission-critical statement here?", "Well, I think it may be this: sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury.", "Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity.", "It is your life-support system, and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality.", "And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness, even the safety and the education of our children.", "It's a silent sleep loss epidemic, and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges that we face in the 21st century.", "I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep, and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laziness.", "And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life, the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were.", "And with that soapbox rant over, I will simply say, good night, good luck, and above all ...", "I do hope you sleep well.", "Thank you very much indeed.", "(Applause) Thank you.", "(Applause) Thank you so much.", "David Biello: No, no, no.", "Stay there for a second.", "Good job not running away, though.", "I appreciate that.", "So that was terrifying.", "Matt Walker: You're welcome.", "DB: Yes, thank you, thank you.", "Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do?", "What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else?", "MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep.", "Sleep is not like the bank.", "You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time.", "I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic and that our health deteriorates so quickly, first, it's because human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason.", "DB: Because we're smart.", "MW: And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature, throughout the course of evolution, has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation.", "So she's never developed a safety net, and that's why when you undersleep, things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body.", "So you just have to prioritize.", "DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed, what do I do?", "MW: So if you are staying in bed awake for too long, you should get out of bed and go to a different room and do something different.", "The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness, and you need to break that association.", "So only return to bed when you are sleepy, and that way you will relearn the association that you once had, which is your bed is the place of sleep.", "So the analogy would be, you'd never sit at the dinner table, waiting to get hungry, so why would you lie in bed, waiting to get sleepy?", "DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call.", "Great job, Matt.",
