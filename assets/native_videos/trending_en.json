[{"id": "yt_x32Zq-XvID4", "userId": "system_native", "title": "The Obviously True Theorem No One Can Prove", "language": "en", "content": "- [Derek] In Xiamen, China, in the winter of 1954, (fire crackling) air raid sirens (explosions thudding) are sounded all over the city. (siren blaring) People scramble for cover (people screaming) as artillery shells (artillery shells blasting) are being fired in the distance. (artillery shells blasting) The people's Republic of China is bombarding the nearby Kinmen Islands in an attempt to take over control from the anti-communist Chinese. (tank rattling) (boots thudding) But troops on the islands fire back. (artillery shells blasting) Soon, artillery shells are raining down on both sides. (explosion thudding) (siren blaring) (tense music continuing) Back in Xiamen, (siren blaring) Inside one of these shelters is 21-year-old Chen Jingrun. As others are fidgeting impatiently, waiting for the explosions to stop, Chen is reading pages (explosion blasting) from a math book, (pages rustling) because he's on a mission to solve one of the oldest problems in math. (dramatic tense music) - A child can understand the statement, but the greatest geniuses in mathematical history have not been able to solve it. - In the year 2000, a publishing house even offered a $1 million prize to anyone who could solve the problem. But for nearly 300 years, everyone who has tried (dramatic music building) has failed. So the problem is this, can every even number greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes? - So that's the problem. So we can do some examples. (pen cap clicking) We can say, for example, 6. You know that's an even integer. So can we write it as the sum of two primes? So those are numbers that only divide by themselves and by 1. So for 6, it's just 3 plus 3, and we can do more and more numbers. So 10, for example, would be, you know, 5 plus 5, but also 7 plus 3. There's one I want to do, one extra, which is your favorite number. - 42. - 42. What makes it up? - 37 and 5. - 37. Yeah. But there's also a, sort of, nicer, more methodical, way of writing this out, and it will help us (paper rustling) build some intuition. - [Casper] We'll start by drawing two diagonal lines. (soft inquisitive music) - I'm building like a pyramid. A pyramid of prime numbers. (pen cap clicking) - [Derek] All right. - [Casper] So, we're gonna start at the top. We're gonna write down 2. Then we'll write down 3. 5. And this is gonna be a good test of how well I know my primes. Then we'll do the same on the other sides. Okay, and now, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna draw a line from each prime. Can you see where this is going? - [Derek] And where they cross is every sum? - [Casper] Yeah. Now I can start adding them. So we get 2 plus 2. - 4. - [Casper] 4. 3 plus 3. - 6. - 6. You can see, we're starting to get all these numbers. The main point here is just, as you go down, not only do you see all the even numbers appear, but they also seem to appear more frequently. And it seems like it should always happen. And, of course, the conjecture is that it does always happen, and that's known as the gold Goldbach's conjecture. - [Derek] Chen's obsession (mysterious gentle music) with the conjecture goes back to his high school years, when his teacher stood in front of the class telling the students all about the sciences, and said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences. Number theory is the queen's crown. And the Goldbach's conjecture is the pearl on the crown.\" (soft music continuing) - Shortly after, the teacher said, \"Well, perhaps, one day, one of you kids will solve it.\" And then the whole class burst out laughing. (people laughing) Everyone except for Chen Jingrun. (inspiring classical music) He later said, \"I did not laugh. I did not dare to laugh. I was worried my classmates would know my vision, but I never forgot this lesson to always remember the pearl on the crown, and to never forget my aspirations or ideals.\" - [Derek] And now, (alarm blaring) as air raid alarms are ringing, he's maintained his vision. (alarm blaring) He's working on his math, trying to solve Goldbach's conjecture. - And then it's like, well, who the hell is Goldbach? (playful classical music) Do you know a Goldbach? - I know nothing about Goldbach. - Christian Goldbach is a little known Prussian mathematician who grew up in the early 1700s. At first, (paper rustling) he mostly studied medicine and law, only occasionally dabbling in mathematics. But then in 1710, at the age of 20, he set off on a 14 year, and over 4,000 kilometer long, journey to meet some of the greatest mathematicians alive. (playful classical music playing) In Leipzig, he met with Gottfried Leibniz, the co-inventor of calculus. And, in London, he met with both Nicolaus Bernoulli, and, perhaps the greatest mathematician of all time, Sir Isaac Newton. (classical music continuing) He then finished this trip around Europe before ultimately settling down in Russia at the newly formed St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. (waves crashing) (seagulls cawing) Where, in 1727, he met his most important connection, a 20-year-old math prodigy. Can you guess who? - Leonard Euler? - Leonard Euler. (both laughing) - The two quickly became friends, bonding over a shared obsession with number theory. Then, in 1729, Goldbach moved to Moscow, but the two stayed in touch, writing letters to each other for the next 35 years, literally until Goldbach died. (tense fast music playing) (wind whooshing) It was in one of these letters, (paper rustling) on the 7th of June, 1742, where Goldbach scribbled a line in the margin. It was not the exact form of the conjecture which now bears his name, but something related. (wind whooshing) \"It seems that every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" (slow classical music) Euler was intrigued by the proposition, but he thought the idea could be refined further. It made sense to him that odd numbers might need three numbers to add together to make them, but then he turned his attention to even numbers, and he thought, \"Well, with even numbers, perhaps just two prime numbers would be enough to sum to give you every even number.\" In fact, as Euler wrote in his letter, this is how Goldbach originally framed the problem in person. So, Euler reformulated Goldbach's idea (wind whooshing) into two separate conjectures. (wind whooshing) The first dealt with odd numbers, and said, \"Every odd number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" This became known as the weak Goldbach conjecture. And the second (wind whooshing) dealt with even numbers. It said, \"Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.\" This became known as the strong Goldbach conjecture. (wind whooshing) (playful gentle music) They get their names strong and weak conjecture, because (wind whooshing) if you have the strong conjecture, then you've shown that every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of just two primes. And then you can add three (wind whooshing) to each of those sums to get all of the odd numbers. So if you can prove the strong conjecture, you get the weak one for free. But the reverse is not true. If you can prove the weak conjecture, you still don't get the strong one. Now, after Euler reformulated these conjectures, he was so confident they were true, that he wrote, \"I regard this as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.\" - And he couldn't, you know? And for the next 150 years, almost no progress is made. (cymbals crashing) - [Derek] That is until, in 1900, German mathematician David Hilbert addressed the International Congress of Mathematicians, in Paris. (paper rustling) And there, he listed 23 of the most important problems for the 20th century. (pages rustling) Number eight on that list was all about prime numbers, including Goldbach's conjecture. (pen scratching) - Goldbach's conjecture was back on the radar. Only now, mathematicians started to look at the problem differently. (gentle inquisitive music) - [Derek] Let's take a look at our pyramid again. One thing to notice is that this pyramid is symmetrical. When two primes add to make an even number on the right side, those same two primes make an even number on the left side. So, to avoid double counting, we can look only at the right side of this center line. And what we find is that for very small even numbers, like 4, 6, or 8, well, there's only one way to write them as the sum of two primes. But for larger numbers, like 20, well, now there are multiple different ways to write it as the sum of two primes, and the further down you go, the more combinations you find. - So, mathematicians started asking a new question, not just whether every even number can be written as the sum of two primes, but in how many different ways it can be done. - [Derek] Let's call that number H of N. For example, H of 4 is 1, because you can only write 4 as the sum of primes 2 plus 2. H of 20 is 2, because that is 3 plus 17, and 7 plus 13. H of 42 is 4, and so on. (bubble popping) Now, so far, we're just counting up what the value of H should be. But in 1923, two English mathematicians, G. H. Hardy and John Littlewood, tried to come up with a function that would estimate H of N. To do it, they relied on one of the most important results from number theory, the prime number theorem. (harp chiming) (bright classical music) This tells you that, on average, a large number in the neighborhood of N, has 1 over the natural logarithm of N chance of being prime. So here's a crude version of what Hardy and Littlewood did. They imagined this large even number, and they said it equal to 2N. So you could split it right down the middle at N. Now they considered a pair of numbers, A and B, that together add up to 2N. Where A is smaller than N, and B is larger. They both must differ from N by the same amount. Let's call it C. Now, according to the prime number theorem, the chance that A is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N - C. And the chance that B is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N plus C. But here's the trick. - Most of the times we're talking about Ns that are ginormous, that are super, super large. And if you look at 1 over L and N, that function would be something like this. Where, basically, it drops very quickly at the start. And, for large numbers, it's almost constant. So that this C really doesn't affect it a whole lot. So, for most of the numbers, we can, sort of, ignore the C, in both cases, and it becomes much simpler, which is just the chance of A being prime is about 1 over L and N, and the chance of B being prime is about 1 over L and N. Now, what's the chance that both are prime? - [Derek] You're gonna multiply 'em together, - We're gonna multiply them together - [Derek] Still, so far we've just looked at one pair, while, in total, there are about N possible pairs, N ways to add up two numbers to get to 2N. So we can just multiply the chance of one pair being prime with the total number of pairs, to find the total expected number of prime pairs, which comes out to about N over ln N squared. And if we plot this, we find that the expected number of ways to write any number as the sum of two primes increases for larger and larger numbers. - Hardy and Littlewood, they refined this a bit more, but essentially what they find, you know, is the exact same thing. They just have like a correction factor in front, but then this term is still the same. - [Derek] The only problem is that this is just an estimate, not a proof. And as they point out in their own conclusion, \"It is only proof that counts.\" - And that's about as far as they get for the strong Goldbach conjecture. But on the weak one, they have more success. (inquisitive pulsing music) - [Derek] It all comes back to a curious incident 10 years earlier, in 1913. We've invited Elmer, from the YouTube channel, Fern, to tell you about it. (tense inquisitive music) - [Elmer] Hardy sits at his breakfast table, when a strange letter arrives. (inquisitive music continuing) It's sent by a completely unknown mathematician from India, (camera clicking) Srinivasa Ramanujan. The letter reads, \"I'm now about 23 years of age. I have no university education, but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school, I've been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at mathematics.\" Ramanujan writes that he's a poor clerk, earning only about 20 pounds a year. He's attached some formulas and is asking for Hardy's opinion. The letter is over 10 pages long and is packed with over 100 theorems, many of them highly advanced, (clicker clicking) yet Ramanujan provides no proofs and very little explanation. Hardy is astounded. He has never seen anything like it. Some are already known, (clock ticking) others are completely new, (clock ticking) unknown to the world. (clock ticking) And then there are results (clock ticking) that seem impossible. (clock ticking) Like that the sum of all positive integers up to infinity is negative 1 12th. How did he come up with this? (shutter clicking) (inquisitive music continuing) Hardy shows a letter to Littlewood. The two stay up until midnight going through the manuscript, debating whether the mysterious author is a genius or a fraud. - But it sounded like Hardy felt these couldn't be crank results because you couldn't imagine them if you were just a crank. They're too fantastical to be the the work of that kind of second rate mind. Only a really phenomenal, off-the-chart, genius could have come up with them. - [Elmer] So Hardy writes back. The rigorous and strict mathematician he is, he asks for proof. (birds tweeting) Ramanujan, however, is nothing like Hardy. He works on intuition, often guided by dreams. - He would just see the result, or in some mystical versions of his own telling, he would say that his personal goddess, Namagiri, would come to him in his dreams, and write the formulas on his tongue. - Wait on his tongue? - On his tongue is the version I've sometimes heard. But in any case, she planted it in his mind. - [Elmer] \"An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.\" Ramanujan never really learned how to provide proof to his theorems. So Hardy urges him to come to Cambridge to explain them in more detail. But there's a problem. (bird tweeting) Ramanujan is a devout Hindu. His faith forbids him from crossing the sea. Then one night his mother has a dream, (harp trilling) a goddess appears, and tells her to let Ramanujan fulfill his destiny. Convinced by the vision she gives her blessing. (camera clicking) And so, Ramanujan finally sets out for England. (inspiring music playing) In Cambridge, Hardy and Ramanujan start working together. - I mean, I'm gonna get choked up thinking about it. It's such a beautiful sentiment. Trying to remember how Hardy put it. It's something like he thought, (gentle music continuing) you know, on a scale from 0 to 100, you know, maybe he's a 10. Littlewood is a 30. Like Ramanujan is an 80, some kind of crazy thing like that. So he knew that Ramanujan was special. Hmm, didn't expect to get emotional for you, but this is what I do when I think about Ramanujan. (Professor Strogatz laughing) - [Elmer] But his new life in England is harsh. He's not used to the climate, (emotional string music) he's not used to the food, and war is ravaging. It will become one of the darkest chapters of his life. If you wanna know more about Ramanujan's struggles, and what made him such a genius, there's an upcoming video on our channel, Fern. - [Derek] While Ramanujan struggled, Hardy and he did make a breakthrough. (hopeful classical music playing) Around 1917, they invented what's known as the circle method, and used it to tackle different problems in number theory. Hardy and Littlewood later developed this idea further, and for the next a hundred years, this would be the main method to tackle the weak Goldbach conjecture. - But let's remind ourselves of the problem. We're trying to prove that we can always write an odd number, large odd number, as the sum of three primes. Call it P1, P2, and P3. (gentle inquisitive music) - But just like before, we don't only want to know whether it's possible, but in how many different ways it can be done. So, Hardy and Littlewood imagined a counting machine of sorts. As input, it would take all possible combinations of three prime numbers smaller than N. (machine ticking) For each combination it would add them up and check if that sum is equal to N. And, if it is, the machine increments a counter by 1. (bell dinging) But if not, the machine does nothing. (bell dinging) It goes on (machine whirring) to the next combination. (machine whirring) Let's do an example. (machine whirring) Say N is 11. Well, the machine first checks the primes 2, 2, and 2, adds them up to get 6, (machine whirring) which is not equal to 11. So the counter stays at 0. (bell dinging) Next it tries 2, 2, 3, which is 7. So again, it does nothing. (bell dinging) And it keeps cycling through until it hits 2, 2, 7, (bell dinging) which is equal to 11. (machine whirring) So now the machine increments the counter (bell dinging) by 1. As it keeps running through primes, the counter increments only one more time for 3, 3, 5. (bell dinging) (machine whirring) So in total, there are two ways to write 11 (bell dinging) as the sum of three primes. But how would you go about building this machine out of mathematics? (pen scratching) Because that is exactly what Hardy and Littlewood did. Their technique is so ingenious, I want to take you through it step by step. It starts with the function E to the I theta. This function just traces out a unit circle in the complex plane. The angle theta determines how far around the circle you are. Now imagine that theta is restricted to be some multiple M of 2 pi. And since 2 pi is one complete revolution, it doesn't matter if M is 0, 1, 2, 3, or any integer, a vector from the origin would always point in the same direction, to the right. But now Hardy and Littlewood multiply the angle by alpha, where alpha is just some number between 0 and 1. You can think of it as a slider. So if M equals 1, and you increase alpha from 0, well, the vector slowly makes one full rotation. If M equals 2, the vector will move around faster and make two full rotations. And this keeps going for higher values of M. Now imagine taking all possible values of alpha simultaneously, and then averaging out all of those vectors. Mathematically, we can write this as the integral from 0, to 1 of E of the I 2 pi alpha, D alpha. So what happens? Well, this vector cancels with this one on the opposite side, and this one with that one. And the same thing happens with all the vectors. So, averaging them, we get 0. The same thing happens if M equals 2, or 3, or 4. This integral will give 0 for all values of M. Except a single case. If M equals 0, then we have E to the 0 which equals 1. So no matter what alpha is, the vector always points to the right, and averaging that will always give 1. So this equation is very close to the machine we were trying to create. If M equals 0, it returns 1, (bell dinging) but if M is not equal to 0, it returns 0. (bell dinging) So all that's left to do is replace M with what we're interested in. Specifically, is the sum of P1 plus P2 plus P3 equal to N? We can rearrange that to get P1 plus P2 plus P3 minus equals 0. So, if we sub in this expression for M, then every time the three primes add up to N, this value will be 0, and the integral (bell dinging) will be equal to one. And every time the primes don't add up to N, this value will be non-zero. And so the integral will return 0. (bell dinging) But, right now, this equation only checks one triplet of primes. To check all possible combinations of primes smaller than N, we need to add a sum. Since this will count up all the ways three primes can add to make N, we can call it H of N. So in fact, let's try it out. Put in N equals 11, compute this function, and it gives 6. (wind whooshing) (paper rustling) Which is not the 2 we found before. So what happened? Well, we've simplified the logic a little bit, so we actually get some duplicates this time. For example, the machine finds 2, 2, 7, but also 7, 2, 2, and 2, 7, 2. Mathematicians correct for this when doing the real calculation, but for our purposes, this machine is good enough. So we've got our H of N, and if we can show that H of N is at least 1 for every odd number greater than 5, then we've proven the weak Goldbach conjecture. But there are two issues with this approach. The first is that we assumed that we know all of the prime numbers smaller than N, which is true when N is small. But as N goes to infinity, we just don't know all of the primes. The second problem is that, as the number of primes increases, the number of possible combinations explodes. If N is 10,001, there are 1,229 smaller prime numbers, which means a total of 310 million, 144 thousand, 296 possible prime triplets. Increase N to a billion, and the possible combinations jumps up to nearly 22 sextillion. (soft piano music playing) And this trend continues. So, using this approach in a simple way won't work. So Hardy and Littlewood came up with a smarter way. They fundamentally reframed the problem by taking the sum inside the integral. Rather than checking all possible combinations of prime numbers by brute force, they now analyze the collective behavior of all the primes at once. To see how this works, take a look at the equation. In the exponent is the sum of three primes minus N, but adding in the exponent is the same as multiplying exponentials together. So we can rewrite this as the product of four exponentials. The first three of these are actually identical because there's nothing to distinguish what we call P1, P2, P3. They're all prime numbers drawn from the same set. So we could just call this function S of alpha and N, and we could multiply it by itself three times, or just cube it. By doing this, H of N is now a function of just two things, E to the minus I two pi N alpha, which is just a complex number that you could compute, and this new function, S of alpha and N. But what is this function? Well, let's do an example. Again, say N equals 11. Then S of alpha and 11 equals just a sum of four exponentials, each governed by its own prime number. You can think of each of these exponentials as a clock, each with its own prime number that determines how fast the clock spins. So 2 turns the slowest, 3 turns faster, 5 turns faster still, and so on. But remember, this is a sum. So we actually need to add up all the clocks tip to tail. Now watch what happens as we increase alpha. All the clocks wind around at their own rates. What we're interested in is not the behavior of any individual clock, but instead all of them together. Since we've chosen a pretty small value for N, nothing too exciting happens, but watch what happens if we pick a larger value for N, like 99. Now there are 25 prime numbers that are smaller than 99, and hence 25 clocks in our sum. Now as we increase alpha, all the clocks, again, wind around at their different rates. It almost looks like a dragon's tail. And for a while everything seems kind of chaotic, circling around the origin, but then, when alpha hits 1 over 6, the tail unwinds, and suddenly almost all the clocks point in a similar direction, and we get a large resultant value. If we increase alpha further, the clocks cancel out again until we hit the next magic point, 1 over 3. Here again, many clocks line up. And this curious pattern keeps repeating. For the majority of values of alpha, the clocks cancel each other out. But at a few special points, like a half, the tail unwinds, the clocks interfere constructively, and we get a large resultant value. - If the angle is, you know, 360 degrees divided by a whole number, you get some very particular behavior that's very predictable. Those are the angles at which this function, when you sum the primes, they actually go far from from 0. And what happens at a random angle, and you just start adding the primes up, it keeps changing which way it's pointing, and the thing just bounces around. - So why is this happening? Well, let's look at when alpha equals a half. Here what we're doing is multiplying each prime number in the exponent by a half. In other words, dividing each prime number by 2. So let's do this for each of the primes. In the first column, we'll write down how many times it can be divided by 2. And in the second column we'll write down the remainder. So 2 divided by 2 equals 1, leaving a remainder of 0. So we've just made one full rotation. 3 divided by two is 1, but that leaves a remainder of 1, so it makes one full rotation and then a half rotation. 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So it makes two full rotations and then a half rotation more. Now, we don't really care about the first column because it doesn't matter how many full rotations a clock makes, we only care about where the arrow ends up. And that's fully determined by the remainder. It's just the remainder times alpha. So from now on we'll just keep track of the remainders. And what we find is that all of the other remainders are equal to 1. So all clocks, except the first one, point the same way. This is because when we're dividing whole numbers by 2, there are only two possible remainders, 0 or 1. And since we're working with prime numbers, only 2 can have the remainder 0, because no other prime number is even, therefore, all other primes must share the remainder 1. (wind whooshing) Meaning all those clocks end up making another half rotation, so they all point left and constructively interfere. (wind whooshing) A similar thing happens when alpha equals a third. Now each prime is divided by 3. So the possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2. Again, 3 is the only clock that has remainder 0, so that points right. But all the other primes follow a special pattern, a pattern that makes the entire circle method possible. The remaining primes distribute themselves roughly equally between remainders 1 and 2, which means all the remaining clocks are rotated one third or two thirds of the way around the circle. Since these clocks are pointing to the left, again, we get constructive interference. And this pattern of constructive interference also occurs for other small rational fractions. But for non-rational numbers, you don't get these nicely restricted remainders. So the clocks are roughly distributed equally all over the circle, and you get destructive interference. (upbeat tense music playing) Hardy and Littlewood realized they could use this. Imagine taking this plot of the magnitude of the resultant arrow and wrapping it around a circle. What they found is that the majority of the contributions come from very small regions of the circle, what they called the major arcs. The rest of the circle only adds minor contributions. So they called these the minor arcs. This allowed them to split up their calculation into two parts. The major arc part gives you the main term for how many ways you can write a number N as the sum of three primes. And the minor arcs just gives you an error term. (upbeat classical music playing) They then showed that, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then the main term grows faster than the error term. So eventually, for some large enough number, call it K, this value will always be larger than 1, and the weak Goldbach conjecture holds. But there are two problems with this approach. The first is that they assumed that a generalization of the Riemann's hypothesis is true, which we don't know. And the second is that they didn't actually specify that number, K. I mean, how big of a number do you need to get to before you can guarantee that all numbers larger than that adhere to Goldbach conjecture? - Then we've got to wait until 1937 when Russian mathematician, Ivan Vinogradov, proves the same as Hardy and Littlewood. But he did it without the generalized Riemann hypothesis. So, you know, assumption free. - It's one thing to just assume the Riemann hypothesis, and say, \"Oh yeah, you can make some progress.\" But Vinogradov's like, \"No guys, you don't need the Riemann hypothesis. You can really prove this stuff.\" - But again, he gives some large enough number for which the weak Goldbach conjecture will hold without specifying that number. And so it's very unsatisfying. (bright classical music) Over the next 19 years, one of his students did get that satisfaction when he could specify that number. Do you want to have any guess as to what the number is? - 10 to the 50? 10 to the 80? 10 of the 3000? I don't know. I was guessing things that are far too low, probably. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's about 10 to the 6.8 million. - Wow, okay. - It's huge. But then you know, from here on, people start working on this method more, and they all use the same techniques. In 1989, the number was brought down to 10 to the 43,000. Next it dropped to 10 to the 7,194. And by 2002 it had dropped all the way down to 10 to the 1,346. Now that seems so much smaller than what we had before, but if you compare it to how many, you know, protons there are in the universe, which is 10 to the power 80, that's not something you can check by computer. It's absolutely, absolutely hopeless. Even if you turned the whole universe into a computer, you would still have no chance of solving this. So it really needed to get dragged down. - [Derek] This is roughly where the problem stood in 2005, when, Peruvian mathematician, Harald Helfgott became interested in it. (upbeat classical music playing) - He was reading papers about the weak Goldbach conjecture, and new techniques that were being developed. So these were the cutting edge techniques at the time. He was reading it and he thought. - I can do better. I'm having some ideas how to do better. And, you know, it took me a couple of weeks to get better estimates. Not still, you know, strong enough to revolutionize everything, but to make real progress. - So he gets to work and within a couple of weeks he's got better estimates than that in the paper. So now he's getting more confident, like, \"Okay, I got this.\" - Of course, I was a bit naive. I underestimate some difficulties elsewhere. (upbeat bright string music) - To solve the problem, he realized he needed to do two things. One, get the computational number as high as possible, and two, get the constant down as much as he could, which is where the difficult math comes in. So, over the next eight years, he attacked the problem from both sides. Together with David Platt, he checked all numbers up to 8.8 times 10 to the 30 by computer. And by refining his math, he slowly brought down the constant number, K. (numbers ticking) By 2013, he gets the number all the way down to 10 to the 27, which is below the number that his computers had already checked. - So he solved it. He wrote up his results in a paper called \"The Ternary Goldbach Conjecture is True,\" which is quite the mike-drop title. So, nearly 300 years after Goldbach's original letter, Helfgott proved that every odd number greater than five can be written as the sum of three primes. And as a result, he also proved that every even number greater than 2, can be written as the sum of at most four primes. This is because you can always just add 3 to all the odd numbers to get all the even numbers. - So was it a big deal? Were people excited? (playful gentle music playing) - Yeah, it's a good question. I feel like it is mostly an obscure problem. I think the strong one, and this with both of these problems, like they don't have any direct application to the real world. (inquisitive music continuing) Because it's so simple, it has this massive wide appeal, and everyone will kind of know about it. It's also one of the oldest unsolved problems. What did you do when you proved it? - Well, I put it on the archive. Like any normal person. It was a big relief. - You know, given your success (playful piano music playing) with the weak form of the Goldbach conjecture, how do you feel about the strong form? - Oh, I think that's hopeless for the moment. (Casper laughing) And if it yields. If it were to yield during our lifetimes, I wouldn't bet on it, in fact, I would bet against it. - See, the reason the circle method works for the weak Goldbach conjecture is because this main term grows faster than this error term. But that's not the case for the strong Goldbach conjecture. - The major arcs are no longer major. The main contribution comes from the minor arc. So at least as much of the contribution comes from the minor arcs. - So, to solve the strong conjecture, we need some fundamentally new technique, or approach, but we haven't found it yet. (tense classical music playing) - The person who arguably got the closest was Chen Jingrun. (pen scratching) In 1956, Chen was recognized for his mathematical prowess, and, a year later, he became an assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he spent the next 10 years working on problems in number theory, including Goldbach's conjecture. By 1966, he hit a major breakthrough. By using another approach, known as sieve methods, he proved that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and a number that's either a prime, or the product of exactly two primes, what we call a semi prime. - It's a very learned and brilliant proof. I think Andre Weil compared following his proof, is like climbing along the top of the Himalayas. (wind whooshing) You know, that you're way up high in (laughing) practically the stratosphere. It's such a sophisticated argument. - This was the closest anyone had gotten to solving the problem. (playful music continuing) Elated, Chen showed the proof to a colleague, who suggested he should announce the result, and then tidy it up before publishing. - But just as Chen announced his result, the country plunged into chaos. (dramatic music) (crowd shouting) - [Derek] In May, 1966, chairman of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, declared that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society, and they must be purged. This marked the start of the Cultural Revolution, a radical campaign to defeat perceived enemies of the Party. With support from Mao, militant student revolutionaries, known as the Red Guard, (soldiers marching) stormed institutions. (soldiers marching) They burned books and turned on intellectuals. Teachers, scientists, and professors were subjected to brutal public spectacles, known as struggle sessions. They were beaten, humiliated, and forced to wear towering caps, and placards listing their supposed crimes, like capitalist sympathizer or enemy of the revolution. (emotional soft music) Across China, the pursuit of knowledge was replaced by fear and political conflict. By 1968, 131 of the 171 senior members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing faced persecution. And many others lost their lives. - Chen was one of the targets. (shove rattling) He was forced into manual labor, (fire crackling) and made to live in a converted boiler room with no electricity. (shove rattling) The Red Guard insulted him, spat on him, and beat him so badly that Chen often lost consciousness. - In one report, it was so bad that he may have tried to commit suicide. He jumped off of a third story building and, fortunately, didn't hit the ground. He landed on the second floor, and got injured, but didn't die. - [Derek] Despite all of this, (tense music playing) Chen kept secretly working on his math under the dim light of a kerosene lamp. Then on the 13th of September, (plane whirring) 1971, Mao's right-hand man died (camera clicking) in a mysterious plane crash. (camera clicking) After supposedly trying organize a coup. His death shattered the illusion of unity in the Party, (clicker clicking) and the cultural revolution began to lose steam. (clicker clicking) (bright dramatic music) - But Chen faced a dilemma. On the one hand, he wanted to publish his proof, but on the other he was terrified of being criticized, Unsure what to do, he turned to Luo Shengxiong, the head of the mathematical institute, who told him, \"The result is sound. You must publish.\" (dramatic music continuing) - [Derek] And so in April, 1973, Chen published his theorem. Three years later, Mao Zedong died and the Cultural Revolution ended. Famous journalist, Xu Chi took note of Chen's story, and wrote an article about his achievements and hardship. (uplifting music) The article was reprinted in China's most popular newspaper, and read by millions. The State that, just 10 years earlier, silenced Chen now celebrated him as a national hero. His story was retold in schools, books, and films. He even got an asteroid named after him in 1996. - And imagine if he hadn't done it, you know, if he hadn't published it. Like all his work, his whole mission, his whole ideals, his whole vision, maybe no one would've known about it. It would've just been a little line somewhere, like, \"Oh, I've got this proof, but, yeah, I'm not gonna show it to you.\" You know? But so often we like shoot ourselves down, whereas really do your best and then put it out into the world, and then let the world, sort of, like evaluate it. And while Chen got incredibly close, he was never able to fulfill his ultimate dream, to solve the strong Goldbach conjecture. (dramatic music playing) Perhaps one reason why it's so hard to prove true is because maybe it's not. Maybe it's false. But if it is false, then there's a very easy way to show that, by finding a counter example. A single even number that can't be written as the sum of two primes. - If Goldbach is false, it would be very easy for you to convince me that Goldbach is false. - Just find a counter example. - That is the only way that you can convince me that Goldbach is false. If Goldbach is false, then it's false because there's a counter example. And if there's a counter example, then you can give me the counter example, and I can check for myself, then, yes, that's a counter example. - [Casper] In this pursuit, in 1938, a mathematician, named Nils Pipping, checked all numbers up to a hundred thousand, by hand, but he didn't find a single counterexample. Since then, modern computers have brought this number up to four quintillion, and the conjecture holds for every single one of them. - [Derek] In fact, we can also use computers to check in just how many ways a different number can be written as the sum of two primes, (bright music) which gives us this pattern. It looks like a curve with tails, it strongly resembles a comet, which is why this is known as Goldbach's comet. It shows that as the number gets larger, there are more and more ways to write every even number as the sum of two primes. And if we overlay our heuristic argument from before, we find that it matches up remarkably well. - The one way the conjecture could be false is if, for whatever reason, at some very large number, there's a conspiracy where this completely breaks down, and it suddenly drops below that line. Are there any examples where you suddenly have a big drop in the number of ways you can compose a number? - No, no, those asymptotics seem to hold very nicely. There are no big drops. - [Derek] So it seems like the conjecture should be true. - We've tested, by brute force, all the numbers up to four quintillion, and they all obey Goldbach's conjecture. So you might think that we should have found a counterexample by now, or, at least, a number that doesn't follow this general trend we've seen. But, on the scale of all numbers, four quintillion is nothing. So we'll have to come up with some smart approach, or fundamentally new way, of solving this problem. Now, as far as we know, solving Goldbach's conjecture doesn't really affect any other areas of math. And it also doesn't seem to have any direct applications to the real world. So you might think, why bother solving this problem? Why not work on some big problem that we know is important? But I think that misses the point. (gentle inquisitive music) - What if the Goldbach conjectures turns out it is opening up a whole new part of the multiverse of mathematical ideas. We don't really know 'cause we don't have the bird's eye view, or the God's eye view, of math. It's what it looks like to us right now on the web of math. So, I tend to dislike this picture of certain things are central (inquisitive music continuing) and other things are peripheral. People should do what fires them up. Because if you do that, you'll be passionate, you'll think about it all the time. You'll do it when you're in the shower. You'll think about it when you're driving. And you might do something remarkable because of that passion. And if you're just doing something 'cause you think it's important, I think you'll tend to be second rate, honestly. (laughing) I like the modest view that we don't know what's necessarily important, but we do know what we love. So work on that. (electronics whirring) (inquisitive music continuing) - Goldbach's conjecture frustrated mathematicians for centuries. And, for a long time, (wind whooshing) it seemed like an unsolvable problem. Many gave up, thinking it was just too big to tackle. But as we've seen, it only takes a few incredibly determined individuals who reject the status quo to keep pushing towards a solution. And it's not just big math problems. Life is full of inconveniences (bright happy music) that some of us just start to accept as unsolvable. For me, shaving was one of these things. The irritation, the razor burn, the cost of constantly replacing razors. It felt like something I just kinda had to put up with. But then I started using (choir vocalizing) the Henson Razor, and I can honestly say it was a game changer. (upbeat joyful music) I've been using it ever since we first started working together two years ago, and now I don't go anywhere without it. And it's not just me. (clicker clicking) Many of you have shared your experiences too. The experts from Henson come from the aerospace world and they applied the same obsessive focus to create a better shaving experience. Their razor is made using CNC machines, which are capable of achieving incredibly tight tolerances. The razor blades stick out just 0.03 millimeters. That means that the blade is perfectly supported, so it maintains its precise 30 degree cutting angle, and it reduces chaffer, the tiny up and down vibrations that can cause skin irritation. If you want a better shaving experience, engineered by experts, head over to hensonshaving.com/veritasium. Use my code \"veritasium\" for a hundred free blades with the purchase of any razor. Make sure to add both the razor and the blades to your cart for the code to take effect. And try the Henson Razor for yourself.

Moscow, but the two stayed in touch, writing letters to each other for the next 35 years, literally until Goldbach died.", "(tense fast music playing) (wind whooshing) It was in one of these letters, (paper rustling) on the 7th of June, 1742, where Goldbach scribbled a line in the margin.", "It was not the exact form of the conjecture which now bears his name, but something related.", "(wind whooshing) \"It seems that every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" (slow classical music) Euler was intrigued by the proposition, but he thought the idea could be refined further.", "It made sense to him that odd numbers might need three numbers to add together to make them, but then he turned his attention to even numbers, and he thought, \"Well, with even numbers, perhaps just two prime numbers would be enough to sum to give you every even number.\" In fact, as Euler wrote in his letter, this is how Goldbach originally framed the problem in person.", "So, Euler reformulated Goldbach's idea (wind whooshing) into two separate conjectures.", "(wind whooshing) The first dealt with odd numbers, and said, \"Every odd number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" This became known as the weak Goldbach conjecture.", "And the second (wind whooshing) dealt with even numbers.", "It said, \"Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.\" This became known as the strong Goldbach conjecture.", "(wind whooshing) (playful gentle music) They get their names strong and weak conjecture, because (wind

differently.", "(gentle inquisitive music) - [Derek] Let's take a look at our pyramid again.", "One thing to notice is that this pyramid is symmetrical.", "When two primes add to make an even number on the right side, those same two primes make an even number on the left side.", "So, to avoid double counting, we can look only at the right side of this center line.", "And what we find is that for very small even numbers, like 4, 6, or 8, well, there's only one way to write them as the sum of two primes.", "But for larger numbers, like 20, well, now there are multiple different ways to write it as the sum of two primes, and the further down you go, the more combinations you find.", "- So, mathematicians started asking a new question, not just whether every even number can be written as the sum of two primes, but in how many different ways it can be done.", "- [Derek] Let's call that number H of N.", "For example, H of 4 is 1, because you can only write 4 as the sum of primes 2 plus 2.", "H of 20 is 2, because that is 3 plus 17, and 7 plus 13.", "H of 42 is 4, and so on.", "(bubble popping) Now, so far, we're just counting up what the value of H should be.", "But in 1923, two English mathematicians, G.", "H.", "Hardy and John Littlewood, tried to come up with a function that would estimate H of N.", "To do it, they relied on one of the most important results from number theory, the prime number theorem.", "(harp chiming) (bright classical music) This tells you that, on average, a large number in the neighborhood of N, has 1 over the natural logarithm of N chance of being prime.", "So here's a crude version of what Hardy and Littlewood did.", "They imagined this large even number, and they said it equal to 2N.", "So you could split it right down the middle at N.", "Now they considered a pair of numbers, A and B, that together add up to 2N.", "Where A is smaller than N, and B is larger.", "They both must differ from N by the same amount.", "Let's call it C.", "Now, according to the prime number theorem, the chance that A is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N - C.", "And the chance that B is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N plus C.", "But here's the trick.", "- Most of the times we're talking about Ns that are ginormous, that are super, super large.", "And if you look at 1 over L and N, that function would be something like this.", "Where, basically, it drops very quickly at the start.", "And, for large numbers, it's almost constant.", "So that this C really doesn't affect it a whole lot.", "So, for most of the numbers, we can, sort of, ignore the C, in both cases, and it becomes much simpler, which is just the chance of A being prime is about 1 over L and N, and the chance of B being prime is about 1 over L and N.", "Now, what's the chance that both are prime?", "- [Derek] You're gonna multiply 'em together, - We're gonna multiply them together - [Derek] Still, so far we've just looked at one pair, while, in total, there are about N possible pairs, N ways to add up two numbers to get to 2N.", "So we can just multiply the chance of one pair being prime with the total number of pairs, to find the total expected number of prime pairs, which comes out to about N over ln N squared.", "And if we plot this, we find that the expected number of ways to write any number as the sum of two primes increases for larger and larger numbers.", "- Hardy and Littlewood, they refined this a bit more, but essentially what they find, you know, is the exact same thing.", "They just have like a correction factor in front, but then this term is still the same.", "- [Derek] The only problem is that this is just an estimate, not a proof.", "And as they point out in their own conclusion, \"It is only proof that counts.\" - And that's about as far as they get for the strong Goldbach conjecture.", "But on the weak one, they have more success.", "(inquisitive pulsing music) - [Derek] It all comes back to a curious incident 10 years earlier, in 1913.", "We've invited Elmer, from the YouTube channel, Fern, to tell you about it.", "(tense inquisitive music) - [Elmer] Hardy sits at his breakfast table, when a strange letter arrives.", "(inquisitive music continuing) It's sent by a completely unknown mathematician from India, (camera clicking) Srinivasa Ramanujan.", "The letter reads, \"I'm now about 23 years of age.", "I have no university education, but I have undergone the ordinary school course.", "After leaving school, I've been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at mathematics.\" Ramanujan writes that he's a poor clerk, earning only about 20 pounds a year.", "He's attached some formulas and is asking for Hardy's opinion.", "The letter is over 10 pages long and is packed with over 100 theorems, many of them highly advanced, (clicker clicking) yet Ramanujan provides no proofs and very little explanation.", "Hardy is astounded.", "He has never seen anything like it.", "Some are already known, (clock ticking) others are completely new, (clock ticking) unknown to the world.", "(clock ticking) And then there are results (clock ticking) that seem impossible.", "(clock ticking) Like that the sum of all positive integers up to infinity is negative 1 12th.", "How did he come up with this?", "(shutter clicking) (inquisitive music continuing) Hardy shows a letter to Littlewood.", "The two stay up until midnight going through the manuscript, debating whether the mysterious author is a genius or a fraud.", "- But it sounded like Hardy felt these couldn't be crank results because you

with them.", "- [Elmer] So Hardy writes back.", "The rigorous and strict mathematician he is, he asks for proof.", "(birds tweeting) Ramanujan, however, is nothing like Hardy.", "He works on intuition, often guided by dreams.", "- He would just see the result, or in some mystical versions of his own telling, he would say that his personal goddess, Namagiri, would come to him in his dreams, and write the formulas on his tongue.", "- Wait on his tongue?", "- On his tongue is the version I've sometimes heard.", "But in any case, she planted it in his mind.", "- [Elmer] \"An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.\" Ramanujan never really learned how to provide proof to his theorems.", "So Hardy urges him to come to Cambridge to explain them in more detail.", "But there's a problem.", "(bird tweeting) Ramanujan is a devout Hindu.", "His faith forbids him from crossing the sea.", "Then one night his mother has a dream, (harp trilling) a goddess appears, and tells her to let Ramanujan fulfill his destiny.", "Convinced by the vision she gives her blessing.", "(camera clicking) And so, Ramanujan finally sets out for England.", "(inspiring music playing) In Cambridge, Hardy and Ramanujan start working together.", "- I mean, I'm gonna get choked up thinking about it.", "It's such a beautiful sentiment.", "Trying to remember how Hardy put it.", "It's something like he thought, (gentle music continuing) you know, on a scale from 0 to 100, you know, maybe he's a 10.", "Littlewood is a 30.", "Like Ramanujan is an 80, some kind of crazy thing like that.", "So he knew that Ramanujan was special.", "Hmm, didn't expect to get emotional for you, but this is what I do when I think about Ramanujan.", "(Professor Strogatz laughing) - [Elmer] But his new life in England is harsh.", "He's not used to the climate, (emotional string music) he's not used to the food, and war is ravaging.", "It will become one of the darkest chapters of his life.", "If you wanna know more about Ramanujan's struggles, and what made him such a genius, there's an upcoming video on our channel, Fern.", "- [Derek] While Ramanujan struggled, Hardy and he did make a breakthrough.", "(hopeful classical music playing) Around 1917, they invented what's known as the circle method, and used it to tackle different problems in number theory.", "Hardy and Littlewood later developed this idea further, and for the next a hundred years, this would be the main method to tackle the weak Goldbach conjecture.", "- But let's remind ourselves of the problem.", "We're trying to prove that we can always write an odd number, large odd number, as the sum of three primes.", "Call it P1, P2, and P3.", "(gentle inquisitive music) - But just like before, we don't only want to know whether it's possible, but in how many different ways it can be done.", "So, Hardy and Littlewood imagined a counting machine of sorts.", "As input, it would take all possible combinations of three prime numbers smaller than N.", "(machine ticking) For each combination it would add them up and check if that sum is equal to N.", "And, if it is, the machine increments a counter by 1.", "(bell dinging) But if not, the machine does nothing.", "(bell dinging) It goes on (machine whirring) to the next combination.", "(machine whirring) Let's do an example.", "(machine whirring) Say N is 11.", "Well, the machine first checks the primes 2, 2, and 2, adds them up to get 6, (machine whirring) which is not equal to 11.", "So the counter stays at 0.", "(bell dinging) Next it tries 2, 2, 3, which is 7.", "So again, it does nothing.", "(bell dinging) And it keeps cycling through until it hits 2, 2, 7, (bell dinging) which is equal to 11.", "(machine whirring) So now the machine increments the counter (bell dinging) by 1.", "As it keeps running through primes, the counter increments only one more time for 3, 3, 5.", "(bell dinging) (machine whirring) So in total, there are two ways to write 11 (bell dinging) as the sum of three primes.", "But how would you go about building this machine out of mathematics?", "(pen scratching) Because that is exactly what Hardy and Littlewood did.", "Their technique is so ingenious, I want to take you through it step by step.", "It starts with the function E to the I theta.", "This function just traces out a unit circle in the complex plane.", "The angle theta determines how far around the circle you are.", "Now imagine that theta is restricted to be some multiple M of 2 pi.", "And since 2 pi is one complete revolution, it doesn't matter if M is 0, 1, 2, 3, or any integer, a vector from the origin would always point in the same direction, to the right.", "But now Hardy and Littlewood multiply the angle by alpha, where alpha is just some number between 0 and 1.", "You can think of it as a slider.", "So if M equals 1, and you increase alpha from 0, well, the vector slowly makes one full rotation.", "If M equals 2, the vector will move around faster and make two full rotations.", "And this keeps going for higher values of M.", "Now imagine taking all possible values of alpha simultaneously, and then averaging out all of those vectors.", "Mathematically, we can write this as the integral from 0, to 1 of E of the I 2 pi alpha, D alpha.", "So what happens?", "Well, this vector cancels with this one on the opposite side, and this one with that one.", "And the same thing happens with all the vectors.", "So, averaging them, we get 0.", "The same thing happens if M equals 2, or 3, or 4.", "This integral will give 0 for all values of M.", "Except a single case.", "If M equals 0, then we have E to the 0 which equals 1.", "So no matter what alpha is, the vector always points to the right, and averaging that will always give 1.", "So this equation is very close to the machine we were trying to create.", "If M equals 0, it returns 1, (bell dinging) but if M is not equal to 0, it returns 0.", "(bell dinging) So all that's left to do is replace M with what we're interested in.", "Specifically, is the sum of P1 plus P2 plus P3 equal to N?", "We can rearrange that to get P1 plus P2 plus P3 minus equals 0.", "So, if we sub in this expression for M, then every time the three primes add up to N, this value will be 0, and the integral (bell dinging) will be equal to one.", "And every time the primes don't add up to N, this value will be non-zero.", "And so the integral will return 0.", "(bell dinging) But, right now, this equation only checks one triplet of primes.", "To check all possible combinations of primes smaller than N, we need to add a sum.", "Since this will count up all the ways three primes can add to make N, we can call it H of N.", "So in fact, let's try it out.", "Put in N equals 11, compute this function, and it gives 6.", "(wind whooshing) (paper rustling) Which is not the 2 we found before.", "So what happened?", "Well, we've simplified the logic a little bit, so we actually get some duplicates this time.", "For example, the machine finds 2, 2, 7, but also 7, 2, 2, and 2, 7, 2.", "Mathematicians correct for this when doing the real calculation, but for our purposes, this machine is good enough.", "So we've got our H of N, and if we can show that H of N is at least 1 for every odd number greater than 5, then we've proven the weak Goldbach conjecture.", "But there are two issues with this approach.", "The first is that we assumed that we know all of the prime numbers smaller than N, which is true when N is small.", "But as N goes to infinity, we just don't know all of the primes.", "The second problem is that, as the number of primes increases, the number of possible combinations explodes.", "If N is 10,001, there are 1,229 smaller prime numbers, which means a total of 310 million, 144 thousand, 296 possible prime triplets.", "Increase N to a billion, and the possible combinations jumps up to nearly 22 sextillion.", "(soft piano music playing) And this trend continues.", "So, using this approach in a simple way won't work.", "So Hardy and Littlewood came up with a smarter way.", "They fundamentally reframed the problem by taking the sum inside the integral.", "Rather than checking all possible combinations of prime numbers by brute force, they now analyze the collective behavior of all the primes at once.", "To see how this works, take a look at the equation.", "In the exponent is the sum of three primes minus N, but adding in the exponent is the same as multiplying exponentials together.", "So we can rewrite this as the product of four exponentials.", "The first three of these are actually identical because there's nothing to distinguish what we call P1, P2, P3.", "They're all prime numbers drawn from the same set.", "So we could just call this function S of alpha and N, and we could multiply it by itself three times, or just cube it.", "By doing this, H of N is now a function of just two things, E to the minus I two pi N alpha, which is just a complex number that you could compute, and this new function, S of alpha and N.", "But what is this function?", "Well, let's do an example.", "Again, say N equals 11.", "Then S of alpha and 11 equals just a sum of four exponentials, each governed by its own prime number.", "You can think of each of these exponentials as a clock, each with its own prime number that determines how fast the clock spins.", "So 2 turns the slowest, 3 turns faster, 5 turns faster still, and so on.", "But remember, this is a sum.", "So we actually need to add up all the clocks tip to tail.", "Now watch what happens as we increase alpha.", "All the clocks wind around at their own rates.", "What we're interested in is not the behavior of any individual clock, but instead all of them together.", "Since we've chosen a pretty small value for N, nothing too exciting happens, but watch what happens if we pick a larger value for N, like 99.", "Now there are 25 prime numbers that are smaller than 99, and hence 25 clocks in our sum.", "Now as we increase alpha, all the clocks, again, wind around at their different rates.", "It almost looks like a dragon's tail.", "And for a while everything seems kind of chaotic, circling around the origin, but then, when alpha hits 1 over 6, the tail unwinds, and suddenly almost all the clocks point in a similar direction, and we get a large resultant value.", "If we increase alpha further, the clocks cancel out again until we hit the next magic point, 1 over 3.", "Here again, many clocks line up.", "And this curious pattern keeps repeating.", "For the majority of values of alpha, the clocks cancel each other out.", "But at a few special points, like a half, the tail unwinds, the clocks interfere constructively, and we get a large resultant value.", "- If the angle is, you know, 360 degrees divided by a whole number, you get some very particular behavior that's very predictable.", "Those are the angles at which this function, when you sum the primes, they actually go far from from 0.", "And what happens at a random angle, and you just start adding the primes up, it keeps changing which way it's pointing, and the thing just bounces around.", "- So why is this happening?", "Well, let's look at when alpha equals a half.", "Here what we're doing is multiplying each prime number in the exponent by a half.", "In other words, dividing each prime number by 2.", "So let's do this for each of the primes.", "In the first column, we'll write down how many times it can be divided by 2.", "And in the second column we'll write down the remainder.", "So 2 divided by 2 equals 1, leaving a remainder of 0.", "So we've just made one full rotation.", "3 divided by two is 1, but that leaves a remainder of 1, so it makes one full rotation and then a half rotation.", "5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.", "So it makes two full rotations and then a half rotation more.", "Now, we don't really care about the first column because it doesn't matter how many full rotations a clock makes, we only care about where the arrow ends up.", "And that's fully determined by the remainder.", "It's just the remainder times alpha.", "So from now on we'll just keep track of the remainders.", "And what we find is that all of the other remainders are equal to 1.", "So all clocks, except the first one, point the same way.", "This is because when we're dividing whole numbers by 2, there are only two possible remainders, 0 or 1.", "And since we're working with prime numbers, only 2 can have the remainder 0, because no other prime number is even, therefore, all other primes must share the remainder 1.", "(wind whooshing) Meaning all those clocks end up making another half rotation, so they all point left and constructively interfere.", "(wind whooshing) A similar thing happens when alpha equals a third.", "Now each prime is divided by 3.", "So the possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2.", "Again, 3 is the only clock that has remainder 0, so that points right.", "But all the other primes follow a special pattern, a pattern that makes the entire circle method possible.", "The remaining primes distribute themselves roughly equally between remainders 1 and 2, which means all the remaining clocks are rotated one third or two thirds of the way around the circle.", "Since these clocks are pointing to the left, again, we get constructive interference.", "And this pattern of constructive interference also occurs for other small rational fractions.", "But for non-rational numbers, you don't get these nicely restricted remainders.", "So the clocks are roughly distributed equally all over the circle, and you get destructive interference.", "(upbeat tense music playing) Hardy and Littlewood realized they could use this.", "Imagine taking this plot of the magnitude of the resultant arrow and wrapping it around a circle.", "What they found is that the majority of the contributions come from very small regions of the circle, what they called the major arcs.", "The rest of the circle only adds minor contributions.", "So they called these the minor arcs.", "This allowed them to split up their calculation into two parts.", "The major arc part gives you the main term for how many ways you can write a number N as the sum of three primes.", "And the minor arcs just gives you an error term.", "(upbeat classical music playing) They then showed that, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then the main term grows faster than the error term.", "So eventually, for some large enough number, call it K, this value will always be larger than 1, and the weak Goldbach conjecture holds.", "But there are two problems with this approach.", "The first is that they assumed that a generalization of the Riemann's hypothesis is true, which we don't know.", "And the second is that they didn't actually specify that number, K.", "I mean, how big of a number do you need to get to before you can guarantee that all numbers larger than that adhere to Goldbach conjecture?", "- Then we've got to wait until 1937 when Russian mathematician, Ivan Vinogradov, proves the same as Hardy and Littlewood.", "But he did it without the generalized Riemann hypothesis.", "So, you know, assumption free.", "- It's one thing to just assume the Riemann hypothesis, and say, \"Oh yeah, you can make some progress.\" But Vinogradov's like, \"No guys, you don't need the Riemann hypothesis.", "You can really prove this stuff.\" - But again, he gives some large enough number for which the weak Goldbach conjecture will hold without specifying that number.", "And so it's very unsatisfying.", "(bright classical music) Over the next 19 years, one of his students did get that satisfaction when he could specify that number.", "Do you want to have any guess as to what the number is?", "- 10 to the 50?", "10 to the 80?", "10 of the 3000?", "I don't know.", "I was guessing things that are far too low, probably.", "- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.", "It's about 10 to the 6.8 million.", "- Wow, okay.", "- It's huge.", "But then you know, from here on, people start working on this method more, and they all use the same techniques.", "In 1989, the number was brought down to 10 to the 43,000.", "Next it dropped to 10 to the 7,194.", "And by 2002 it had dropped all the way down to 10 to the 1,346.", "Now that seems so much smaller than what we had before, but if you compare it to how many, you know, protons there are in the universe, which is 10 to the power 80, that's not something you can check by computer.", "It's absolutely, absolutely hopeless.", "Even if you turned the whole universe into a computer, you would still have no chance of solving this.", "So it really needed to get dragged down.", "- [Derek] This is roughly where the problem stood in 2005, when, Peruvian mathematician, Harald Helfgott became interested in it.", "(upbeat classical music playing) - He was reading papers about the weak Goldbach conjecture, and new techniques that were being developed.", "So these were the cutting edge techniques at the time.", "He was reading it and he thought.", "- I can do better.", "I'm having some ideas how to do better.", "And, you know, it took me a couple of weeks to get better estimates.", "Not still, you know, strong enough to revolutionize everything, but to make real progress.", "- So he gets to work and within a couple of weeks he's got better estimates than that in the paper.", "So now he's getting more confident, like, \"Okay, I got this.\" - Of course, I was a bit naive.", "I underestimate some difficulties elsewhere.", "(upbeat bright string music) - To solve the problem, he realized he needed to do two things.", "One, get the computational number as high as possible, and two, get the constant down as much as he could, which is where the difficult math comes in.", "So, over the next eight years, he attacked the problem from both sides.", "Together with David Platt, he checked all numbers up to 8.8 times 10 to the 30 by computer.", "And by refining his math, he slowly brought down the constant number, K.", "(numbers ticking) By 2013, he gets the number all the way down to 10 to the 27, which is below the number that his computers had already checked.", "- So he solved it.", "He wrote up his results in a paper called \"The Ternary Goldbach Conjecture is True,\" which is quite the mike-drop title.", "So, nearly 300 years after Goldbach's original letter, Helfgott proved that every odd number greater than five can be written as the sum of three primes.", "And as a result, he also proved that every even number greater than 2, can be written as the sum of at most four primes.", "This is because you can always just add 3 to all the odd numbers to get all the even numbers.", "- So was it a big deal?", "Were people excited?", "(playful gentle music playing) - Yeah, it's a good question.", "I feel like it is mostly an obscure problem.", "I think the strong one, and this with both of these problems, like they don't have any direct application to the real world.",

when you proved it?", "- Well, I put it on the archive.", "Like any normal person.", "It was a big relief.", "- You know, given your success (playful piano music playing) with the weak form of the Goldbach conjecture, how do you feel about the strong form?", "- Oh, I think that's hopeless for the moment.", "(Casper laughing) And if it yields.", "If it were to yield during our lifetimes, I wouldn't bet on it, in fact, I would bet against it.", "- See, the reason the circle method works for the weak Goldbach conjecture is because this main term grows faster than this error term.", "But that's not the case for the strong Goldbach conjecture.", "- The major arcs are no longer major.", "The main contribution comes from the minor arc.", "So at least as much of the contribution comes from the minor arcs.", "- So, to solve the strong conjecture, we need some fundamentally new technique, or approach, but we haven't found it yet.", "(tense classical music playing) - The person who arguably got the closest was Chen Jingrun.", "(pen scratching) In 1956, Chen was recognized for his mathematical prowess, and, a year later, he became an assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,

curve with tails, it strongly resembles a comet, which is why this is known as Goldbach's comet.", "It shows that as the number gets larger, there are more and more ways to write every even number as

jet engine?", "language": "en", "content": "- This is one of the most powerful jet engines in the world, and it actually runs at temperatures 250 degrees Celsius hotter than the melting point of the materials that make it up. - [Assistant] That's 1,200 degrees. - So the question is, why doesn't a jet engine just melt into a puddle? (intense music) (jet hovering) - We are right at the boundaries of the laws of physics (intense music) - That is wild. It's at the same temperature now as it would be inside the jet engine. But here, they're liquid. (dramatic music) - Every time I get on a plane, I'm thinking, \"This is never gonna work.\" - And yet, it does work. Right now, there are over 10,000 planes in the sky powered by engines just like these. Maybe you are on one right now. So, how do they work? (energetic music) (jet humming) This is a jet engine, specifically a turbofan engine. At the front is this giant fan. During takeoff, these rotating blades push 1.3 tons of air backwards every second, and around 10% of that air gets compressed. The compressors force the air into increasingly narrow chambers. They compress the air to about 50 times atmospheric pressure. And just by doing that, the air heats up to around 600 degrees Celsius. This compressed air is then forced into the combustion chamber, where fuel is sprayed in through a ring of nozzles and ignited. (flames blasting) That chemical reaction gives off a lot of heat. So the temperature jumps to around 1,500 degrees Celsius. So now you've got this high-pressure gas from the combustor that just wants to expand, and now it's got an incredible amount of thermal energy. But between the combustion chamber and the outside air is this. (intense music) Rows of turbine blades. (blades humming) So, in order for the gas to expand and get out, it needs to push these turbine blades out of the way. And in pushing the blades, that is how it transfers its energy to the engine. This is where all the power really comes from in modern jets on takeoff, each high-pressure turbine blade is generating as much power as a Formula 1 car. (car droning) And there are 68 of them. (lively music) As the gas rushes through the turbine and nozzle, its pressure drops from around 50 atmospheres down to one, and it expands by almost 20 times. And that spins these turbine blades up to 12,500 revolutions per minute. The fan that is pushing all that air backward and all those compressors that squeeze the air down, all of that is powered by the turbines back here. It's a kind of funny, really counterintuitive way to think about an engine. It's what's happening in the back that's actually driving everything up front. (pensive music) As the hot exhaust gas is shot out the back of the engine, it pushes the engine forward. That generates thrust. But did you know that in a modern passenger jet, this accounts for less than 20% the thrust of the engine? The vast majority of the thrust, over 80% of it, just comes from that big fan at the front of the jet. (numbers beeping) Remember how only 10% of the incoming air gets compressed? The other 90% bypasses all that. It's simply propelled backwards by the fan. It goes right around the guts of the engine and comes straight out the back. The fan pushes that air backwards, so the air pushes the fan forwards. That's how you get 80% of the thrust. It's basically a huge ducted propeller. (jet hovering) So, why do it this way? I mean, why not compress all the incoming air and put it all through the combustion chamber and turbines? (flames blasting) Well, some fighter jets do exactly this, and it makes for very powerful engines, but they're also horribly inefficient. To see why, remember that the impulse pushing the plane forward is equal to the change in the momentum of the air backwards. So you've got options. For example, you could push twice as much air back half as fast, or you could push half as much air back twice as fast. Both will generate the exact same impulse, but the kinetic energy of the air is proportional to v squared. So it takes four times as much energy to speed up the air in the second case, and a lot of that energy is just wasted in the exhaust. So, ideally, you want to push as much air backwards as possible with only a small change in velocity. (enchanted music) That's why jets have gotten bigger and bigger over the years, and the increasing fraction of bypass air has the added benefit that it surrounds the hot exhaust gases, and that reduces noise coming away from the jet. But there is another major factor when it comes to engine efficiency, and that is temperature. At cruising altitudes around 35,000 feet, the outside air is around negative 55 degrees Celsius, while inside the engine, it's over 1,500 degrees Celsius. The hot, high-pressure gas inside the engine wants to expand into the much colder, lower-pressure air outside. It's that difference that lets the engine turn heat into useful work. (ominous music) But there's a fundamental limit to how much work any heat engine can get from that. It's called the Carnot efficiency. It's equal to one minus the temperature of the cold outside air divided by the temperature of the hot gas inside the combustion chamber. (ominous music) So, looking at this, you can improve the efficiency of the engine in two ways, either fly where the air is colder or raise the temperature in the combustion chamber. One problem with that, though, is that it turned the inside of a jet engine into one of the harshest environments we have ever built in which machinery has to survive. - To keep a turbine blade whole and unaffected within an engine is like putting an ice cube inside your oven, turning up to max, leaving for work, coming back after an eight-hour shift, and finding it's still completely frozen in the oven. That's what we've got to try and do within that engine. - It sounds absurd. (intense music) Not only do the turbine blades sit in a stream of gas that's over 1,500 degrees Celsius, they're also spinning at 12,500 RPM with the tip of each blade slicing through the air at nearly 1,900 kilometers per hour. Now, every blade wants to fly straight, but it's forced to spin in a circle, which means, something has to be constantly pulling it inwards. That's the centripetal force. If you take a representative 300 gram high-pressure turbine blade and run it at that speed and radius, it has to be pulled inwards with a force equal to the weight of 20 metric tons. That's roughly the weight of two London double-decker buses tugging on each blade as it spins, all while they're glowing hot. (ominous music) To make matters worse, at these temperatures, oxygen wants to react with the metal of the blades itself. And on top of all that, the air rushing through the engine often carries dust, sand, and pollutants that can damage and erode the surfaces inside. And somehow, these blades have to survive this punishment for tens of thousands of flight hours without deforming, cracking, or failing. They really determine how efficient you can make the engine because you can't make the engine so hot that the blades can't withstand that temperature. So they determine the maximum temperature of the combustion chamber, and therefore, the maximum efficiency you can realize with a jet engine. So what kind of metal could possibly survive these conditions? Well, we sent Veritasium producer, Emilia, to the Department of Materials Science & Metallurgical at Cambridge University to put some different metals to the test. (ominous music) - So this is the steel? This is the steel sample, yes. - Okay. - So we've got about 200 megapascals to start with, which is sort of comparable to some of the stress that's seen by these components in real applications. And we're gonna put that stress on, and then slowly increase the temperature. - [Derek] This is a mild steel. It's relatively strong and easy to form into complex shapes. It seems like a pretty good bet for a turbine blade. And at first, under this load and at these low temperatures, it holds up pretty well. We're essentially tugging on all the atoms within the metal. We're not breaking or forming any bonds. We're just making them flex a little. And that slightly changes the spacing between the atoms. And as a result, the metal gets slightly longer. This resulting change in size, specifically the per-unit change in length, is what we call strain. Critically, at this stage, the material is behaving elastically. If we remove the load right now, the material just snaps back to its original size. In an engine, some elastic deformation like this will occur. It can't be too big or it'll cause problems. But what we really don't want is plastic deformation if the shape changes permanently. And that's exactly what starts to happen as we keep increasing the temperature. - [Howard] It's getting hot now. That's a little bit of oxide. (ominous music) There you go, see this starting to deform? - [Derek] Now, bonds are breaking and reforming as the metal at us deforms permanently. (ominous music) But this doesn't happen all at once. So I got the mechanical engineer on our team, Henry, to build this demo. (ominous music) - Okay, so you can see we're getting a bunch of tiny little bubbles, and just naturally, they're packing into this hexagonal arrangement. And there are actually a lot of materials that have atomic structures just like this. But you can see it's not perfect. Like, right here, you can see there's an extra half-plane of atoms. Well, in this case, bubbles, this is called an edge dislocation. (ominous music) It becomes really interesting when I try to pull this raft apart. (ominous music) You can see these little dark lines that zip back and forth. Those are dislocations, and they move through the lattice. As the dislocation moves, it'll cause one plane, a bubbles, to sheer past the other one, which shifts the structure by exactly one spacing. But there isn't just one dislocation. There are plenty of them. And altogether, their movement produces dramatic changes in the overall shape. (ominous music) - [Derek] That's exactly what's happening here. Everywhere that stress is high enough, billions of dislocations are moving and interacting. The steel starts to deform continuously under this constant load in a process called creep. It takes energy to break the atomic bonds as the dislocation travels through the lattice. So, as we ramp up the temperature and all the atoms get more thermal energy, it no longer requires as much stress to break these bonds, becomes much easier for the dislocations to move. The metal effectively gets softer. Now the steel strength drops so much that the slow, time-dependent creep gives way to rapid deformation. As it stretches, it rapidly decreases in cross-section, and eventually, the remaining metal can no longer bear the load. (ominous music) Now, you could try doing similar tests for other metals like this titanium alloy. (ominous music) Titanium is about half as dense as steel. - Should feel that's quite a bit lighter. - Yeah, it's like loads lighter. - [Derek] So if we were to make turbine blades out of titanium, each blade would be much lighter, and that would reduce the enormous centripetal forces it would experience. So it seems like a great choice. And at first, it performs really well. - That's 100 degrees. It's hanging in there. - [Derek] But as we push the temperature higher... - [Howard] Oh, I can see some glowing. (energetic music) Oh, look at this, oh, it's gone already. (Emilia laughs) - [Derek] Just like the steel, its strength drops rapidly as temperature increases. And that's true for most metals. (lively music) Yet, the first jet engine, dating back all the way to 1941, actually did use steel turbine blades. It was designed by British pilot and engineer Frank Whittle. His engine powered the first flight of a British jet aircraft, the Gloster E.28/39 prototype. When a colleague excitedly told Whittle, \"Frank, it flies,\" he dryly quipped, \"That was bloody well what it was designed to do, wasn't it?\" (film whirs) (lively music) But Whittle's prototype had two major flaws. The first was that the gas inside the engine, only reached temperatures of around 780 degrees Celsius, which was one of the reasons it was inefficient. And the second was that it was only allowed to fly for up to 10 hours. Any longer, and it was too likely parts inside the engine would fail. And both of these drawbacks were largely due to the steel turbine blades. Something that occurred to me is, why aren't they made out of tungsten? I mean, because tungsten doesn't melt until 3,400 degrees Celsius, which is more than twice the temperature inside a modern jet engine. But tungsten is also incredibly dense. It's about two and a half times denser than steel, and it's also brittle, which makes it hard to manufacture. And using a material that heavy wouldn't just make the blade a problem. The components that hold the blade in the engine would also have to carry much higher loads, well beyond what current materials can handle. So, you can optimize for one thing, like the melting point, or a different thing like strength or weight. But the turbine pushes every variable to its limit. So what are these blades actually made of? (energetic music) Well, to find out, we went to Rolls-Royce's precision Casting Facility in Derby, and it turns out the world's most advanced metal parts begin life as, well, something surprising. (lively music) What is with the, like the pink and the green there? - Well, come, I'll show you. - Okay, all right. - I'll come and show you. - I'm just seeing so many cool things around here. I'm like, \"What is that? Why does it look like that?\" You just enter this room, and I smell the wax. - Yeah, yeah. - Smells like a candle factory in here. - Absolutely, so investment casting is a really, really ancient technology. So our ancestors have been doing investment casting to make jewelry, to make weapons for millennia. We've just perfected it here to make turbine blades. - It's so wacky. This is just not how I'd expect it to happen at all. (intense music) Turbine blades strike me as one of the most high-tech things in the world. - Yep. - And yet, this facility is using wax as a starting point. - What you will see through our tour today is that, actually, it's a really highly technological process. (ominous music) This is our wax pattern die. This is how a turbine blade starts its life. So, this is what's gonna go inside the wax pattern, a ceramic core. This is gonna create a hollow inside the turbine blade. So what's happening now is we're injecting into the die. So that's the very start of the life of a turbine blade. - That is really neat. - What we'll actually see is that a lot of these features, such as the aerofoil and the annular surfaces are not touched further. So we will cast that, and that will remain as cast as it goes into the engine. (ominous music) - [Derek] Every surface here has to be perfect because this wax is what will become the blade. - So Kim is our wax pattern assembler. So she's responsible for taking the product straight from that die, making sure that things like die lines have been removed. So where the die box come together and leave a small amount of flash, the operative word in all of wax assembly is smooth. - [Derek] Every tiny imperfection in the wax would become a flaw in the metal. So this takes an incredible amount of skill. (ominous music) - Then it's the case of getting that wax pattern attached to the unit runner to create the assembly. - I mean, the thought that occurs to me, right? Shouldn't you be doing this with a robot? - Can, you know, like- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, Rolls-Royce has facilities that do this by robot, but our facility in particular is very much focused on bringing in those new products. And it's far, far easier for us to work with human beings to develop that method of manufacture that's going to bring the next generation of product through. - I'll bet, I can see the skill here, like it's phenomenal. - Absolutely. - I'll just make a mess of it. - Absolutely, so would I. - Would you like a go? - No. (laughs) (ominous music) Once the wax assembly is perfect, it's ready for the next stage. - Everything that is wax is gonna become air, it's gonna become negative space, right? It's gonna become our cavity. And then we're gonna fill that air with metal. (ominous music) So we take that wax assembly, and we've gotta build a shell. (pensive music) Shell is made of many different layers. It's a zircon-based shell system. We're gonna dip into a primary story. It's really quite thin, like a light syrup or a thin honey. - Oh yeah. (pensive music) - [Henry] And what that's designed to do is map all of those really complex geometric features. - Beautiful. (engine droning) It's like making icing. - [Henry] So that's actually the analogy we use. So, it's a bit like if you put icing on top of a bun or a cake, you need to sprinkle it with some sugar afterwards, otherwise, it's all gonna slop off the top. So we've got the slurry on there. We're gonna get a nice even coat, drain it, make sure that it's an even thin layer. And then we're gonna sand, and that's then gonna set that layer in place. - So cool. (machine droning) Whoa. (machine droning) We're then gonna dry it, so it's air-dried for many, many hours. And then we can create our backup layers. So our backup layers, it's a much thicker slurry, more like a treacle, and the sand is much coarser, more like a granulated sugar. And we're gonna maybe put four, five, maybe even six layers to back up, because what we need is we need a mold that can withstand that casting parameters that we're putting in the die. You know, it's got a lot of work to do. - The wax is then melted out, and the mold is fired. Oh, yeah. (machine whooshing) That is wild. Cleaned and tested to make sure there aren't any cracks. When it's done, this shell is ready to hold molten metal. - This is a billet of alloy that's gonna fill the whole of that mold. So just that amount of metal is gonna fill that whole mold there. - It doesn't look like an F. (ominous music) This is a nickel alloy. The first nickel alloys used in jet engines were developed in the 1940s. By adding chromium and cobalt, engineers created alloys that could handle 800 to 900 degrees Celsius, around 100 degrees hotter than the steel used before. And these alloys could keep their strength for thousands of hours, a tenfold improvement in life. But the real breakthrough came when they added a touch of aluminum. (film whirring) So we wanted to see how it held up under the same lab conditions as the steel and titanium. - [Emilia] What temperature are we in now? - [Howard] Oh, that's 700 degrees. - [Emilia] 700, so the steel's long gone. - Steel's, long gone. That's 800 degrees. 800, yes. (flames blasting) - [Derek] In around this temperature, it's actually getting stronger. (ominous music) So why would heating a metal make it stronger? Well, when these nickel alloys were first used in jet engines, no one actually knew. But about 10 years later, electron microscopes had improved enough for engineers to finally see what was happening inside. (ominous music) As we zoom in on the alloy, a pattern emerges. The microstructure isn't uniform. Instead, it kind of looks like a city grid made up of blocks with rods in between them. Only, each block is so small, over 300 would line up across the width of a human hair. (ominous music) Now, surprisingly, both the rods and the blocks are made up of the exact same atoms, mostly nickel with a little aluminum. They even have the same crystal structure, a grid of tiny cubes with atoms sitting at the corners and at the center of each face. The only difference is that the atoms are arranged slightly differently. In the road structure, the aluminum and nickel can take any spot. There is no repeating sequence from cube to cube. And this is known as the gamma phase. But in the blocks, aluminum always takes the corner spots, and nickel the faces, and you get a perfect repeating pattern cube after cube. This is the gamma prime phase. And it's this difference that is crucial when a dislocation tries to glide through the lattice. In the rods, this motion is easy. Each layer of atoms can shear smoothly past the next, leaving the structure looking unchanged behind it. But if you try to do the same thing in the blocks, well, now you're actually changing the order of the atoms, nickel and aluminum end up sitting in the wrong places. That takes energy, so the lattice resists it. So, when a dislocation moving through the rods hits a block, it gets stuck. And that's what makes this alloy so strong. - [Henry] But if you keep pushing and the stress gets high enough, dislocation can finally force its way in. The catch is that this dislocation leaves the lattice in such a high-energy mess that the only way that it can keep moving is if there's a second one right behind it that puts things back in order. So in the gamma prime phase, dislocations have to travel in pairs, called super dislocations. - I need that creation of those super dislocations, and I need that very high stress to be able to shear. So that's why the strength is very high relative to other alloys. What happens is, ultimately, because you're shearing through that gamma prime with two dislocations, as the temperature continuously increases, you're adding more and more thermal energy in the material. What happens is the atoms are gonna vibrate more and more and more. So there's a likelihood, as I'm doing this and I'm oscillating in three dimensions, that the thermal energy is gonna drive me to actually slip down rather than just slip in one plane. So, now, if one cross slips, they're no longer on the same plane. Think of it as if we're standing in line, and the only way that you can move is I push you, right? And then, I keep on pushing you, and then suddenly, you drop. So if I now try to push you, I cannot find you, right? You're not in front of me anymore. Your shoulders are now below me. - Well, how do you touch 'em? (laughs) (Jaafar laughs) - I should have used the other example, you pushing me. But anyway. (both laughing) But it's exactly that. It's the exact same analogy. There's nothing to push me anymore. There's like, I am not able to do it. (ominous music) - So now you've got these two dislocations that are on different planes, so they can't travel together anymore. And as a result, they're both now locked into place. And you can see that effect on this graph. While steel and titanium strength drops off, in the nickel super alloy, you actually get a peak. That's because the extra thermal energy lets more dislocations cross-slip and get separated. And it's that that shuts down the motion of dislocations. But if gamma prime is so strong, why don't we just make the entire turbine blade out of it? Well, that strength comes at a cost. Gamma prime stops the dislocation so effectively that it becomes brittle. All it takes is one crack or a sudden impact, and it could lead to a sudden failure. So the real trick is in striking the right balance between enough gamma prime to trap the dislocations and to prevent this creep, but also enough gamma to keep the alloy ductile, so that it can bend without breaking. - [Derek] And in our test, you can see exactly how that plays out. - A 1,000 degrees, and still nothing. - Still nothing. (ominous music) (mold clanks) - [Howard] There we go. - [Emilia] Oh my gosh. (suspense music) - [Howard] That's 1,100 degrees C. - It's stretching. (suspense music) I mean, it's still holding up like- - It's doing a good job. That's 1,200 degrees C. - [Emilia] 1,200. (laughs) - [Howard] That's the temperature program that stops. And it's still surviving. - [Emilia] Still going. - But if you push the temperature too far, even this alloy reaches its limits. Cross-slip becomes easier. The paired dislocations can now hop between the planes together, and the ordered cubes of gamma primes start to dissolve. So the dislocations break free, and it finally gives out. - [Howard] Oh, it may have just, did it break? - Oh, yeah, yeah, it did, it broke. - But strength alone isn't what makes these alloys special. When you heat up the alloy, aluminum at the surface reacts with oxygen to form a thin continuous layer of aluminum oxide. Unlike the brittle oxides that form on other materials like steel or titanium, this layer stays intact at high temperatures, protecting the metal below. (suspense music) And by adding other elements, we can tune these super alloys. Each one brings a specific property that we want. Most modern super alloys contain as many as 10 different elements, all carefully balanced in their relative abundances for the desired properties. Chromium improves resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Cobalt, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and vanadium help stabilize the gamma prime phase. Molybdenum and iron strengthen the gamma matrix. And then there's rhenium. Rhenium has one of the highest melting points of any metal at 3,180 degrees Celsius. It's second only to tungsten. In the nickel super alloy, It slows the atomic-scale rearrangements, enhancing the alloy's resistance to deformation even at temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. It's one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust at less than one part per billion. And more than 80% of what we mine ends up right here in jet engines. (ominous music) - But even with these advancements in alloy chemistry, there's still one fundamental problem. And that's that metals are crystalline. Any metal you see from the tip of this ballpoint pen to the spoon in my coffee cup, they're all actually made up of millions of little crystals stuck together. It's kind of like grains in the sugar cube. If I crush it... (ominous music) It's not like I've broken any individual crystal, I've just broken them apart. It's the boundaries between the grains that are the weak point. And it's the same thing in a metal. (ominous music) - So, if we zoom out from the gamma and gamma prime structure, it looks something like this. One crystal is basically a three-dimensional lattice of atoms all lined up in the same orientation. But the crystals themselves are all in different orientations. So where they meet, their lattices don't line up. And that mismatch leaves more open spaces and broken bonds. And you also get defects there, like vacancies and impurities, all of which make grain boundaries the weakest point. And this also has another consequence. It makes it easier for atoms to move along the boundaries. They become kind of super highways for atomic diffusion. This becomes even more of a problem at high temperatures when atoms have more energy to move around, add stress like the massive centrifugal loads on a turbine blade, and the grains can actually start to slide past each other. The whole structure slowly deforms, stretching, almost like warm taffy. (ominous music) As long as it has grains in it, it will creep, and fail far more easily. And that's a really hard problem to solve because normally, as a molten alloy cools, tiny crystals start to form all throughout the liquid. So you have to find some way to control them. - This is one of our furnaces. They're all induction-heated, there's no kind of gas, fire, or anything like that, and they're all under vacuum. So, we only cast to the vacuum in the absence of any atmosphere, but particularly oxygen, which is obviously metallurgically gonna cause us all kinds of problems with oxides. - [Derek] You start by pouring molten super alloy into a ceramic mold that's mounted vertically and heated to about the same temperature as the melt. The mold fills from the root up toward the tip. At the very bottom of the mold sits a copper plate cooled by water. Its surface is patterned with tiny grooves that act as nucleation points for the first crystals to start to form. It's here that solidification begins. Then, the entire mold is slowly lowered out of the hot zone, so the solidification continues in just one direction. - It's a very slow process in the magnitude of hours. Once that's finished, the whole machine will then index round, and it will push the completed mold up out of the other side. - Oh. (machine humming) Wow. - So our casting temperatures are roughly 1,500 degrees Celsius. - It's kind of at the same temperature now as it would be inside the jet engine. - Exactly. - It's absurd, they like, you're making the turbine blades at the same temperature that they're gonna operate, but they like, here, they're liquid. (ominous music) Now, if we just did that on its own, you'd end up with a blade that looks like this. (ominous music) - Here's a directionally solidified blade. And what you can probably see there is the contrast between the grains. These are all different crystals, but they're all running on this axis of the blade, which makes it significantly stronger than an alloy that is cast, where all of the crystals are separate from each other. - So those are like individual crystals. - [Henry] These are individual crystals, yeah, absolutely. So we are looking at- - Wow. - At crystals on kind of a macro level, where normally, we'd be talking about crystals on a micro level. (ominous music) - In a rotating turbine, the blade is being pulled along its length. With columnar crystals all lined up along this span, the blade can carry those stresses far more effectively. There are no grain boundaries that cut across the blade, creating weak points for it to crack. But scientists have found a way to do even better. If you introduce a bend in the mold just above the chill plate, something strange happens. The number of columnar crystals that make it through drops sharply. And if you add another bend, even fewer survive. (ominous music) So, engineers added a helical passage known as the pigtail here at the bottom of the mold. - The pigtail is doing the job to select the single crystal. The spiral is gonna choke out every other grain bar one. So we're only gonna have one grain that is then gonna grow through the entirety of that blade, and cast that blade as a single crystal. Or at least, that's the theory. - That's crazy. - So this is a starter attached to a spiral that we've etched so that we can reveal that structure. So you can see down at the bottom, we are starting to grow directionally solidified grains. But as we get up here, we can start to see that we're growing directionally solidified grains. And then, as we're going up the spiral, the grains are starting to be choked out by the upper surfaces of that spiral until, when we get to the top, we're just as a single crystal. And then, that then allows that to grow right the way through the blade. - Yeah, that's amazing. - And what we should end up with is a blade like this. So this is a blade of a single crystal. It's a really impressive thing to look at. (ominous music) The shimmer is beautiful. - Yeah. - Even after the blade solidifies, it's still not ready for the engine. It's heated again, almost to its melting point. And that might sound risky because we've spent all this time making sure it's a perfect single crystal. But this heating step lets the atoms shuffle around just enough to spread out evenly, and form the final desired microstructure of the gamma and gamma prime phases that make these super alloys so strong. - And as if casting, as a single crystal is not enough, actually, the orientation of that crystal is also of paramount significance. So you may have cast this as a single crystal, but if the crystal orientation is off by a certain amount, you get completely different stress responses within that blade. - Today, after decades of development, over 95% of blades can be cast successfully as single crystals. Just think about how incredible that is. We've gone from a turbine blade that contained on the order of 50,000 crystal grains down to just one. When we grow these things, they don't solidify as a uniform front. On a microscopic scale, the solidification front looks like a forest of tiny tree-like branches called dendrites that are pushing their way into the liquid. At first glance, it looks messy, like millions of separate trees jostling for space. There are up to 10 elements in there, each with its own density and melting point. Yet somehow, every one of those trees is locked into the exact same crystal lattice. So the final crystal is comprised of more than six times 10 to the 24 atoms, that is more stars than there are in the observable universe. When all these atoms are repeating the same pattern, perfectly aligned from root to tip, this completely transformed what jet engines can do. Single-crystal blades can withstand stresses and temperatures that would destroy ordinary alloys. They last up to nine times longer against creep and thermal fatigue, and are more than three times more resistant to corrosion than blades made from multiple grains. That's why modern jet engines can now run for 25,000 hours between major overhauls, something that would've been unthinkable before single crystal blades. (suspense music) And the impact has been huge. Between 1960 and 2010, jet aircraft became about 55% more fuel efficient. And a huge part of that improvement comes down to advances in these nickel super alloys. Back in the 1960s, flying was a luxury few could afford. A one-way flight from New York to Paris would set you back $310, which is about $3,750 adjusted for inflation. But as engines became more efficient, able to handle hotter cores and equipped with much larger fans, airlines could carry more people farther using less fuel. So, tickets got cheaper and air travel exploded. Today, at any given moment, there are roughly 10,000 to 14,000 planes in the sky. That scale of movement is possible because of these turbine blades. (jet hovering) In the furnace, the nickel super alloy outperforms all the other samples, surviving up to 1,200 degrees Celsius. But wait, that's still 300 degrees less than the temperature inside a jet engine. So why don't the blades melt? Well, there are two final layers of defense. The first is built into the shape of the blade itself. - We then have to leach the core out. So we do that in a caustic solution of potassium-sodium hydroxide under pressure and temperature to leach the core out, that will leave those core passages completely empty. - [Derek] And those passages are the real secret to the turbine blade survival. - So as the air's flowing through, it is turbulent, and as such, it can remove much more heat from the surface of the blade. - Yeah. - Than it was. - Is it these ridges here that we're talking about? - Exactly, yeah, yeah, these ridges here. - [Derek] They're intentional to the trip the flow into- - Trip and turbulate that air flow so that it's removing as much heat as possible from the metal. So then we get onto the really juicy part, which is film cooling. So we talked about the ice cube in the ovens that keeping our blades as cool as possible. So this is where we start to drill in what we call film cool holes. And what we're aiming to do is we're aiming to get into those cooling passages. So we saw that core earlier on. They are the cooling passages inside. And these holes have got to get right into those cooling passages to allow the air to come out. And the air is then gonna blow as a film over the surface of the blade, a film-cool hole to create a film of air, which is preventing that metal from melting in those temperatures. - This cooling air isn't exactly cold. It actually comes from the high-pressure compressor section of the engine at around 600 degrees Celsius. But that is cool enough to help keep the blades from melting. But it's still not quite enough. And you can't just add more cooling air because every extra bit of air you use from the compressor, you lose from thrust, and actually make the engine less efficient. So every turbine blade is also coated with two protective layers. First, a thin metallic bond coat that resists oxidation, and then a ceramic topcoat. Even though it's only about a quarter of a millimeter thick, this ceramic coating can keep the metal beneath it 100 to 170 degrees cooler than it would otherwise be. And this is the final barrier that stops the blades from melting. So, now we've got this insane piece of engineering that can survive the 1,500-degree gas. The intense load and the oxidation problem should be solved. Well, it would be, except for one thing, (ominous music) - At 36,000 feet, you wouldn't believe this, but there's dirt and dust in the atmosphere that our engines are ingesting. (ominous music) The dirt and dust comes, it sticks on the blades, but it also goes through the whole cooling circuit, and it walks the cooling from getting through to cool the blades, and then the blades burn up. Usually, every time I get on a plane, I'm thinking, \"This is never gonna work.\" (laughs) No, I mean it's incredible how an engine can work 'cause there's so many moving pieces, there's so many parts to the environment, so terrible. And now, we have this dust and dirt, which is really bad. (intense music) - I am at Testbed 80, and they're about to fire up this jet engine and then throw dust into it. The same stuff that makes up sand and volcanic ash, exactly what real engines encounter in flight. - So this engine is the 97K. It goes on the A350 and is our high-thrust version of that. So 97,000 pounds of thrust is what this engine's producing. When we're running a bit an engine like this, we try and carefully recreate exactly what happens in service, (intense music) - How much dust goes in the engine? - Not very much. It was surprising when I found out exactly how much we put in. It's in the order of tablespoons worth per cycle. - So, I (indistinct) master on. Condition power on. (fan swooshing) (buttons clicking) Master fuel lever on. Start request in three, two, one. Now. (computer beeps) (intense music) (blades swooshing) - So, what does the dust actually do inside a jet engine? - So, once it goes through to the hot section of the engine and hits kind of turbine blades, it's gonna be melted. And so, it sticks to the outside of our turbine components and it slowly rips layers of that thermal barrier coating off. And then, you lose your temperature reduction that comes from the barrier coating, so that your nickel alloy underneath it gets hotter and hotter, and that's when it starts to deteriorate the turbine. (blades swooshing) - That's why engineers at Rolls-Royce are still refining these blades, developing new ceramic coatings designed to resist mold and dust, and extend the life of the turbine by up to 30%. That's just the latest step in a story that's been unfolding for decades. These blades have been refined and perfected to the point where they operate right at the edge of what is physically possible. You're always on a knife-edge, pushing every material, every process to the limit to build an engine that can do the seemingly impossible, run hotter than its own melting point. The more I learned about the brutal environment these blades have to survive, the more it felt like they shouldn't work at all. And yet, they do. Every day, these machines carry millions of people across the world and we barely stop to think about them, they're a monument to human ingenuity. What happens when we refuse to accept limits, when we turn the impossible into the routine? (ominous music) (scene change zooms) (ominous music) I can't grow a single-crystal turbine blade in my kitchen, but with the help from this video sponsor, KiwiCo, I can grow a crystal garden with my kids. This month, they sent us their Crystal Garden Chemistry Kit. We set everything in place, mixed up the chemical solution, and then watched as colorful crystals started to bloom over the next 48 hours. Every few hours, my kids would run back to check how much the garden had grown. They were totally fascinated, and it sparked so many questions about crystals and atoms, how things arrange. Pretty soon, we were talking about how metals are crystalline, too, and setting ourselves the challenge of growing one giant crystal turbine-blade style. (camera shuttering) I love how simple KiwiCo makes this. Everything we needed came right in the box, so we could just open it up and dive straight in, doing the experiment. And it's not just chemistry. They've got crates for robotics, engineering, art, design techniques, and so much more. There is something for every age and interest. (scene change chimes) KiwiCo crates also make a great gift for the holidays. It's creative, hands-on, and gives kids something they can actually make and be proud of. - They're kind of messy. - Mm-hmm. - And like hard to make, but not too hard, but hard enough to make it fun. - So if you wanna try out KiwiCo, click the link in the description or scan this QR code.

temperature.", "- [Derek] This is a mild steel.", "It's relatively strong and easy to form into complex shapes.", "It seems like a pretty good bet for a turbine blade.", "And at first, under this load and at these low temperatures, it holds up pretty well.", "We're essentially tugging on all the atoms within the metal.", "We're not breaking or forming any bonds.", "We're just making them flex a little.", "And that slightly changes the spacing between the atoms.", "And as a result, the metal gets slightly longer.", "This resulting change in size, specifically the per-unit change in length, is what we call strain.", "Critically, at this stage, the material is behaving elastically.", "If we remove the load right now, the material just snaps back to its original size.", "In an engine, some elastic deformation like this will occur.", "It can't be too big or it'll cause problems.", "But what we really don't want is plastic deformation if the shape changes permanently.", "And that's exactly what starts to happen as we keep increasing the temperature.", "- [Howard] It's getting hot now.", "That's a little bit of oxide.", "(ominous music) There you go, see this starting to deform?", "- [Derek] Now, bonds are breaking and reforming as the metal at us deforms permanently.", "(ominous music) But this doesn't happen all at once.", "So I got the mechanical engineer on our team, Henry, to build this demo.", "(ominous music) - Okay, so you can see we're getting a bunch of tiny little bubbles, and just naturally, they're packing into this hexagonal arrangement.", "And there are actually a lot of materials that have atomic structures just like this.", "But you can see it's not perfect.", "Like, right here, you can see there's an extra half-plane of atoms.", "Well, in this case, bubbles, this is called an edge dislocation.", "(ominous music) It becomes really interesting when I try to pull this raft apart.", "(ominous music) You can see these little dark lines that zip back and forth.", "Those are dislocations, and they move through the lattice.", "As the dislocation moves, it'll cause one plane, a bubbles, to sheer past the other one, which shifts the structure by exactly one spacing.", "But there isn't just one dislocation.", "There are plenty of them.", "And altogether, their movement produces dramatic changes in the overall shape.", "(ominous music) - [Derek] That's exactly what's happening here.", "Everywhere that stress is high enough, billions of dislocations are moving and interacting.", "The steel starts to deform continuously under this constant load in a process called creep.", "It takes energy to break the atomic bonds as the dislocation travels through the lattice.", "So, as we ramp up the temperature and all the atoms get more thermal energy, it no longer requires as much stress to break these bonds, becomes much easier for the dislocations to move.", "The metal effectively gets softer.", "Now the steel strength drops so much that the slow, time-dependent creep gives way to rapid deformation.", "As it stretches, it rapidly decreases in cross-section, and eventually, the remaining metal can no longer bear the load.", "(ominous music) Now, you could try doing similar tests for other metals like this titanium alloy.", "(ominous music) Titanium is about half as dense as steel.", "- Should feel that's quite a bit lighter.", "- Yeah, it's like loads lighter.", "- [Derek] So if we were to make turbine blades out of titanium, each blade would be much lighter, and that would reduce the enormous centripetal forces it would experience.", "So it seems like a great choice.", "And at first, it performs really well.", "- That's 100 degrees.", "It's hanging in there.", "- [Derek] But as we push the temperature higher...", "- [Howard] Oh, I can see some glowing.", "(energetic music) Oh, look at this, oh, it's gone already.", "(Emilia laughs) - [Derek] Just like the steel, its strength drops rapidly as temperature increases.", "And that's true for most metals.", "(lively music) Yet, the first jet engine, dating back all the way to 1941, actually did use steel turbine blades.", "It was designed by British pilot and engineer Frank Whittle.", "His engine powered the first flight of a British jet aircraft, the Gloster E.28/39 prototype.", "When a colleague excitedly told Whittle, \"Frank, it flies,\" he dryly quipped, \"That was bloody well what it was designed to do, wasn't it?\" (film whirs) (lively music) But Whittle's prototype had two major flaws.", "The first was that the gas inside the engine, only reached temperatures of around 780 degrees Celsius, which was one of the reasons it was inefficient.", "And the second was that it was only allowed to fly for up to 10 hours.", "Any longer, and it was too likely parts inside the engine would fail.", "And both of these drawbacks were largely due to the steel turbine blades.", "Something that occurred to me is, why aren't they made out of tungsten?", "I mean, because tungsten doesn't melt until 3,400 degrees Celsius, which is more than twice the temperature inside a modern jet engine.", "But tungsten is also incredibly dense.", "It's about two and a half times denser than steel, and it's also brittle, which makes it hard to manufacture.", "And using a material that heavy wouldn't just make the blade a problem.", "The components that hold the blade in the engine would also have to carry much higher loads, well beyond what current materials can handle.", "So, you can optimize for one thing, like the melting point, or a different thing like strength or weight.", "But the turbine pushes every variable to its limit.", "So what are these blades actually made of?", "(energetic music) Well, to find out, we went to Rolls-Royce's precision Casting Facility in Derby, and it turns out the world's most advanced metal parts begin life as, well, something surprising.", "(lively music) What is with the, like the pink and the green there?", "- Well, come, I'll show you.", "- Okay, all right.", "- I'll come and show you.", "- I'm just seeing so many cool things around here.", "I'm like, \"What is that?", "Why does it look like that?\" You just enter this room, and I smell the wax.", "- Yeah, yeah.", "- Smells like a candle factory in here.", "- Absolutely, so investment casting is a really, really ancient technology.", "So our ancestors have been doing investment casting to make jewelry, to make weapons for millennia.", "We've just perfected it here to make turbine blades.", "- It's so wacky.", "This is just not how I'd expect it to happen at all.", "(intense music) Turbine blades strike me as one of the most high-tech things in the world.", "- Yep.", "- And yet, this facility is using wax as a starting point.", "- What you will see through our tour today is that, actually, it's a really highly technological process.", "(ominous music) This is our wax pattern die.", "This is how a turbine blade starts its life.", "So, this is what's gonna go inside the wax pattern, a ceramic core.", "This is gonna create a hollow inside the turbine blade.", "So what's happening now is we're injecting into the die.", "So that's the very start of the life of a turbine blade.", "- That is really neat.", "- What we'll actually see is that a lot of these features, such as the aerofoil and the annular surfaces are not touched further.", "So we will cast that, and that will remain as cast as it goes into the engine.", "(ominous music) - [Derek] Every surface here has to be perfect because this wax is what will become the blade.", "- So Kim is our wax pattern assembler.", "So she's responsible for taking the product straight from that die, making sure that things like die lines have been removed.", "So where the die box come together and leave a small amount of flash, the operative word in all of wax assembly is smooth.", "- [Derek] Every tiny imperfection in the wax would become a flaw in the metal.", "So this takes an incredible amount of skill.", "(ominous music) - Then it's the case of getting that wax pattern attached to the unit runner to create the assembly.", "- I mean, the thought that occurs to me, right?", "Shouldn't you be doing this with a robot?", "- Can, you know, like- - Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "So, Rolls-Royce has facilities that do this by robot, but our facility in particular is very much focused on bringing in those new products.", "And it's far, far easier for us to work with human beings to develop that method of manufacture that's going to bring the next generation of product through.", "- I'll bet, I can see the skill here, like it's phenomenal.", "- Absolutely.", "- I'll just make a mess of it.", "- Absolutely, so would I.", "- Would you like a go?", "- No.", "(laughs) (ominous music) Once the wax assembly is perfect, it's ready for the next stage.", "- Everything that is wax is gonna become air, it's gonna become negative space, right?", "It's gonna become our cavity.", "And then we're gonna fill that air with metal.", "(ominous music) So we take that wax assembly, and we've gotta build a shell.", "(pensive music) Shell is made of many different layers.", "It's a zircon-based shell system.", "We're gonna dip into a primary story.", "It's really quite thin, like a light syrup or a thin honey.", "- Oh yeah.", "(pensive music) - [Henry] And what that's designed to do is map all of those really complex geometric features.", "- Beautiful.", "(engine droning) It's like making icing.", "- [Henry] So that's actually the analogy we use.", "So, it's a bit like if you put icing on top of a bun or a cake, you need to sprinkle it with some sugar afterwards, otherwise, it's all gonna slop off the top.", "So we've got the slurry on there.", "We're gonna get a nice even coat, drain it, make sure that it's an even thin layer.", "And then we're gonna sand, and that's then gonna set that layer in place.", "- So cool.", "(machine droning) Whoa.", "(machine droning) We're then gonna dry it, so it's air-dried for many, many hours.", "And then we can create our backup layers.", "So our backup layers, it's a much thicker slurry, more like a treacle, and the sand is much coarser, more like a granulated sugar.", "And we're gonna maybe put four, five, maybe even six layers to back up, because what we need is we need a mold that can withstand that casting parameters that we're putting in the die.", "You know, it's got a lot of work to do.", "- The wax is then melted out, and the mold is fired.", "Oh, yeah.", "(machine whooshing) That is wild.", "Cleaned and tested to make sure there aren't any cracks.", "When it's done, this shell is ready to hold molten metal.", "- This is a billet of alloy that's gonna fill the whole of that mold.", "So just that amount of metal is gonna fill that whole mold there.", "- It doesn't look like an F.", "(ominous music) This is a nickel alloy.", "The first nickel alloys used in jet engines were developed in the 1940s.", "By adding chromium and cobalt, engineers created alloys that could handle 800 to 900 degrees Celsius, around 100 degrees hotter than the steel used before.", "And these alloys could keep their strength for thousands of hours, a tenfold improvement in life.", "But the real breakthrough came when they added a touch of aluminum.", "(film whirring) So we wanted to see how it held up under the same lab conditions as the steel and titanium.", "- [Emilia] What temperature are we in now?", "- [Howard] Oh, that's 700 degrees.", "- [Emilia] 700, so the steel's long gone.", "- Steel's, long gone.", "That's 800 degrees.", "800, yes.", "(flames blasting) - [Derek] In around this temperature, it's actually getting stronger.", "(ominous music) So why would heating a metal make it stronger?", "Well, when these nickel alloys were first used in jet engines, no one actually knew.", "But about 10 years later, electron microscopes had improved enough for engineers to finally see what was happening inside.", "(ominous music) As we zoom in on the alloy, a pattern emerges.", "The microstructure isn't uniform.", "Instead, it kind of looks like a city grid made up of blocks with rods in between them.", "Only, each block is so small, over 300 would line up across the width of a human hair.", "(ominous music) Now, surprisingly, both the rods and the blocks are made up of the exact same atoms, mostly nickel with a little aluminum.", "They even have the same crystal structure, a grid of tiny cubes with atoms sitting at the corners and at the center of each face.", "The only difference is that the atoms are arranged slightly differently.", "In the road structure, the aluminum and nickel can take any spot.", "There is no repeating sequence from cube to cube.", "And this is known as the gamma phase.", "But in the blocks, aluminum always takes the corner spots, and nickel the faces, and you get a perfect repeating pattern cube after cube.", "This is the gamma prime phase.", "And it's this difference that is crucial when a dislocation tries to glide through the lattice.", "In the rods, this motion is easy.", "Each layer of atoms can shear smoothly past the next, leaving the structure looking unchanged behind it.", "But if you try to do the same thing in the blocks, well, now you're actually changing the order of the atoms, nickel and aluminum end up sitting in the wrong places.", "That takes energy, so the lattice resists it.", "So, when a dislocation moving through the rods hits a block, it gets stuck.", "And that's what makes this alloy so strong.", "- [Henry] But if you keep pushing and the stress gets high enough, dislocation can finally force its way in.", "The catch is that this dislocation leaves the lattice in such a high-energy mess that the only way that it can keep moving is if there's a second one right behind it that puts things back in order.", "So in the gamma prime phase, dislocations have to travel in pairs, called super dislocations.", "- I need that creation of those super dislocations, and I need that very high stress to be able to shear.", "So that's why the strength is very high relative to other alloys.", "What happens is, ultimately, because you're shearing through that gamma prime with two dislocations, as the temperature continuously increases, you're adding more and more thermal energy in the material.", "What happens is the atoms are gonna vibrate more and more and more.", "So there's a likelihood, as I'm doing this and I'm oscillating in three dimensions, that the thermal energy is gonna drive me to actually slip down rather than just slip in one plane.", "So, now, if one cross slips, they're no longer on the same plane.", "Think of it as if we're standing in line, and the only way that you can move is I push you, right?", "And then, I keep on pushing you, and then suddenly, you drop.", "So if I now try to push you, I cannot find you, right?", "You're not in front of me anymore.", "Your shoulders are now below me.", "- Well, how do you touch 'em?", "(laughs) (Jaafar laughs) - I should have used the other example, you pushing me.", "But anyway.", "(both laughing) But it's exactly that.", "It's the exact same analogy.", "There's nothing to push me anymore.", "There's like, I am not able to do it.", "(ominous music) - So now you've got these two dislocations that are on different planes, so they can't travel together anymore.", "And as a result, they're both now locked into place.", "And you can see that effect on this graph.", "While steel and titanium strength drops off, in the nickel super alloy, you actually get a peak.", "That's because the extra thermal energy lets more dislocations cross-slip and get separated.", "And it's that that shuts down the motion of dislocations.", "But if gamma prime is so strong, why don't we just make the entire turbine blade out of it?", "Well, that strength comes at a cost.", "Gamma prime stops the dislocation so effectively that it becomes brittle.", "All it takes is one crack or a sudden impact, and it could lead to a sudden failure.", "So the real trick is in striking the right balance between enough gamma prime to trap the dislocations and to prevent this creep, but also enough gamma to keep the alloy ductile, so that it can bend without breaking.", "- [Derek] And in our test, you can see exactly how that plays out.", "- A 1,000 degrees, and still nothing.", "- Still nothing.", "(ominous music) (mold clanks) - [Howard] There we go.", "- [Emilia] Oh my gosh.", "(suspense music) - [Howard] That's 1,100 degrees C.", "- It's stretching.", "(suspense music) I mean, it's still holding up like- - It's doing a good job.", "That's 1,200 degrees C.", "- [Emilia] 1,200.", "(laughs) - [Howard] That's the temperature program that stops.", "And it's still surviving.", "- [Emilia] Still going.", "- But if you push the temperature too far, even this alloy reaches its limits.", "Cross-slip becomes easier.", "The paired dislocations can now hop between the planes together, and the ordered cubes of gamma primes start to dissolve.", "So the dislocations break free, and it finally gives out.", "- [Howard] Oh, it may have just, did it break?", "- Oh, yeah, yeah, it did, it broke.", "- But strength alone isn't what makes these alloys special.", "When you heat up the alloy, aluminum at the surface reacts with oxygen to form a thin continuous layer of aluminum oxide.", "Unlike the brittle oxides that form on other materials like steel or titanium, this layer stays intact at high temperatures, protecting the metal below.", "(suspense music) And by adding other elements, we can tune these super alloys.", "Each one brings a specific property that we want.", "Most modern super alloys contain as many as 10 different elements, all carefully balanced in their relative abundances for the desired properties.", "Chromium improves resistance to oxidation and corrosion.", "Cobalt, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and vanadium help stabilize the gamma prime phase.", "Molybdenum and iron strengthen the gamma matrix.", "And then there's rhenium.", "Rhenium has one of the highest melting points of any metal at 3,180 degrees Celsius.", "It's second only to tungsten.", "In the nickel super alloy, It slows the atomic-scale rearrangements, enhancing the alloy's resistance to deformation even at temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius.", "It's one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust at less than one part per billion.", "And more than 80% of what we mine ends up right here in jet engines.", "(ominous music) - But even with these advancements in alloy chemistry, there's still one fundamental problem.", "And that's that metals are crystalline.", "Any metal you see from the tip of this ballpoint pen to the spoon in my coffee cup, they're all actually made up of millions of little crystals stuck together.", "It's kind of like grains in the sugar cube.", "If I crush it...", "(ominous music) It's not like I've broken any individual crystal, I've just broken them apart.", "It's the boundaries between the grains that are the weak point.", "And it's the same thing in a metal.", "(ominous music) - So, if we zoom out from the gamma and gamma prime structure, it looks something like this.", "One crystal is basically a three-dimensional lattice of atoms all lined up in the same orientation.", "But the crystals themselves are all in different orientations.", "So where they meet, their lattices don't line up.", "And that mismatch leaves more open spaces and broken bonds.", "And you also get defects there, like vacancies and impurities, all of which make grain boundaries the weakest point.", "And this also has another consequence.", "It makes it easier for atoms to move along the boundaries.", "They become kind of super highways for atomic diffusion.", "This becomes even more of a problem at high temperatures when atoms have more energy to move around, add stress like the massive centrifugal loads on a turbine blade, and the grains can actually start to slide past each other.", "The whole structure slowly deforms, stretching, almost like warm taffy.", "(ominous music) As long as it has grains in it, it will creep, and fail far more easily.", "And that's a really hard problem to solve because normally, as a molten alloy cools, tiny crystals start to form all throughout the liquid.", "So you have to find some way to control them.", "- This is one of our furnaces.", "They're all induction-heated, there's no kind of gas, fire, or anything like that, and they're all under vacuum.", "So, we only cast to the vacuum in the absence of any atmosphere, but particularly oxygen, which is obviously metallurgically gonna cause us all kinds of problems with oxides.", "- [Derek] You start by pouring molten super alloy into a ceramic mold that's mounted vertically and heated to about the same temperature as the melt.", "The mold fills from the root up toward the tip.", "At the very bottom of the mold sits a copper plate cooled by water.", "Its surface is patterned with tiny grooves that act as nucleation points for the first crystals to start to form.", "It's here that solidification begins.", "Then, the entire mold is slowly lowered out of the hot zone, so the solidification continues in just one direction.", "- It's a very slow process in the magnitude of hours.", "Once that's finished, the whole machine will then index round, and it will push the completed mold up out of the other side.", "- Oh.", "(machine humming) Wow.", "- So our casting temperatures are roughly 1,500 degrees Celsius.", "- It's kind of at the same temperature now as it would be inside the jet engine.", "- Exactly.", "- It's absurd, they like, you're making the turbine blades at the same temperature that they're gonna operate, but they like, here, they're liquid.", "(ominous music) Now, if we just did that on its own, you'd end up with a blade that looks like this.", "(ominous music) - Here's a directionally solidified blade.", "And what you can probably see there is the contrast between the grains.", "These are all different crystals, but they're all running on this axis of the blade, which makes it significantly stronger than an alloy that is cast, where all of the crystals are separate from each other.", "- So those are like individual crystals.", "- [Henry] These are individual crystals, yeah, absolutely.", "So we are looking at- - Wow.", "- At crystals on kind of a macro level, where normally, we'd be talking about crystals on a micro level.", "(ominous music) - In a rotating turbine, the blade is being pulled along its length.", "With columnar crystals all lined up along this span, the blade can carry those stresses far more effectively.", "There are no grain boundaries that cut across the blade, creating weak points for it to crack.", "But scientists have found a way to do even better.", "If you introduce a bend in the mold just above the chill plate, something strange happens.", "The number of columnar crystals that make it through drops sharply.", "And if you add another bend, even fewer survive.", "(ominous music) So, engineers added a helical passage known as the pigtail here at the bottom of the mold.", "- The pigtail is doing the job to select the single crystal.", "The spiral is gonna choke out every other grain bar one.", "So we're only gonna have one grain that is then gonna grow through the entirety of that blade, and cast that blade as a single crystal.", "Or at least, that's the theory.", "- That's crazy.", "- So this is a starter attached to a spiral that we've etched so that we can reveal that structure.", "So you can see down at the bottom, we are starting to grow directionally solidified grains.", "But as we get up here, we can start to see that we're growing directionally solidified grains.", "And then, as we're going up the spiral, the grains are starting to be choked out by the upper surfaces of that spiral until, when we get to the top, we're just as a single crystal.", "And then, that then allows that to grow right the way through the blade.", "- Yeah, that's amazing.", "- And what we should end up with is a blade like this.", "So this is a blade of a single crystal.", "It's a really impressive thing to look at.", "(ominous music) The shimmer is beautiful.", "- Yeah.", "- Even after the blade solidifies, it's still not ready for the engine.", "It's heated again, almost to its melting point.", "And that might sound risky because we've spent all this time making sure it's a perfect single crystal.", "But this heating step lets the atoms shuffle around just enough to spread out evenly, and form the final desired microstructure of the gamma and gamma prime phases that make these super alloys so strong.", "- And as if casting, as a single crystal is not enough, actually, the orientation of that crystal is also of paramount significance.", "So you may have cast this as a single crystal, but if the crystal orientation is off by a certain amount, you get completely different stress responses within that blade.", "- Today, after decades of development, over 95% of blades can be cast successfully as single crystals.", "Just think about how incredible that is.", "We've gone from a turbine blade that contained on the order of 50,000 crystal grains down to just one.", "When we grow these things, they don't solidify as a uniform front.", "On a microscopic scale, the solidification front looks like a forest of tiny tree-like branches called dendrites that are pushing their way into the liquid.", "At first glance, it looks messy, like millions of separate trees jostling for space.", "There are up to 10 elements in there, each with its own density and melting point.", "Yet somehow, every one of those trees is locked into the exact same crystal lattice.", "So the final crystal is comprised of more than six times 10 to the 24 atoms, that is more stars than there are in the observable universe.", "When all these atoms are repeating the same pattern, perfectly aligned from root to tip, this completely transformed what jet engines can do.", "Single-crystal blades can withstand stresses and temperatures that would destroy ordinary alloys.", "They last up to nine times longer against creep and thermal fatigue, and are more than three times more resistant to corrosion than blades made from multiple grains.", "That's why modern jet engines can now run for 25,000 hours between major overhauls, something that would've been unthinkable before single crystal blades.", "(suspense music) And the impact has been huge.", "Between 1960 and 2010, jet aircraft became about 55% more fuel efficient.", "And a huge part of that improvement comes down to advances in these nickel super alloys.", "Back in the 1960s, flying was a luxury few could afford.", "A one-way flight from New York to Paris would set you back $310, which is about $3,750 adjusted for inflation.", "But as engines became more efficient, able to handle hotter cores and equipped with much larger fans, airlines could carry more people farther using less fuel.", "So, tickets got cheaper and air travel exploded.", "Today, at any given moment, there are roughly 10,000 to 14,000 planes in the sky.", "That scale of movement is possible because of these turbine blades.", "(jet hovering) In the furnace, the nickel super alloy outperforms all the other samples, surviving up to 1,200 degrees Celsius.", "But wait, that's still 300 degrees less than the temperature inside a jet engine.", "So why don't the blades melt?", "Well, there are two final layers of defense.", "The first is built into the shape of the blade itself.", "- We then have to leach the core out.", "So we do that in a caustic solution of potassium-sodium hydroxide under pressure and temperature to leach the core out, that will leave those core passages completely empty.", "- [Derek] And those passages are the real secret to the turbine blade survival.", "- So as the air's flowing through, it is turbulent, and as such, it can remove much more heat from the surface of the blade.", "- Yeah.", "- Than it was.", "- Is it these ridges here that we're talking about?", "- Exactly, yeah, yeah, these ridges here.", "- [Derek] They're intentional to the trip the flow into- - Trip and turbulate that air flow so that it's removing as much heat as possible from the metal.", "So then we get onto the really juicy part, which is film cooling.", "So we talked about the ice cube in the ovens that keeping our blades as cool as possible.", "So this is where we start to drill in what we call film cool holes.", "And what we're aiming to do is we're aiming to get into those cooling passages.", "So we saw that core earlier on.", "They are the cooling passages inside.", "And these holes have got to get right into those cooling passages to allow the air to come out.", "And the air is then gonna blow as a film over the surface of the blade, a film-cool hole to create a film of air, which is preventing that metal from melting in those temperatures.", "- This cooling air isn't exactly cold.", "It actually comes from the high-pressure compressor section of the engine at around 600 degrees Celsius.", "But that is cool enough to help keep the blades from melting.", "But it's still not quite enough.", "And you can't just add more cooling air because every extra bit of air you use from the compressor, you lose from thrust, and actually make the engine less efficient.", "So every turbine blade is also coated with two protective layers.", "First, a thin metallic bond coat that resists oxidation, and then a ceramic topcoat.", "Even though it's only about a quarter of a millimeter thick, this ceramic coating can keep the metal beneath it 100 to 170 degrees cooler than it would otherwise be.", "And this is the final barrier that stops the blades from melting.", "So, now we've got this insane piece of engineering that can survive the 1,500-degree gas.", "The intense load and the oxidation problem should be solved.", "Well, it would be, except for one thing, (ominous music) - At 36,000 feet, you wouldn't believe this, but there's dirt and dust in the atmosphere that our engines are ingesting.", "(ominous music) The dirt and dust comes, it sticks on the blades, but it also goes through the whole cooling circuit, and it walks the cooling from getting through to cool the blades, and then the blades burn up.", "Usually, every time I get on a plane, I'm thinking, \"This is never gonna work.\" (laughs) No, I mean it's incredible how an engine can work 'cause there's so many moving pieces, there's so many parts to the environment, so terrible.", "And now, we have this dust and dirt, which is really bad.", "(intense music) - I am at Testbed 80, and they're about to fire up this jet engine and then throw dust into it.", "The same stuff that makes up sand and volcanic ash, exactly what real engines encounter in flight.", "- So this engine is the 97K.", "It goes on the A350 and is our high-thrust version of that.", "So 97,000 pounds of thrust is what this engine's producing.", "When we're running a bit an engine like this, we try and carefully recreate exactly what happens in service, (intense music) - How much dust goes in the engine?", "- Not very much.", "It was surprising when I found out exactly how much we put in.", "It's in the order of tablespoons worth per cycle.", "- So, I (indistinct) master on.", "Condition power on.", "(fan swooshing) (buttons clicking) Master fuel lever on.", "Start request in three, two, one.", "Now.", "(computer beeps) (intense music) (blades swooshing) - So, what does the dust actually do inside a jet engine?", "- So, once it goes through to the hot section of the engine and hits kind of turbine blades, it's gonna be melted.", "And so, it sticks to the outside of our turbine components and it slowly rips layers of that thermal barrier coating off.", "And then, you lose your temperature reduction that comes from the barrier coating, so that your nickel alloy underneath it gets hotter and hotter, and that's when it starts to deteriorate the turbine.", "(blades swooshing) - That's why engineers at Rolls-Royce are still refining these blades, developing new ceramic coatings designed to resist mold and dust, and extend the life of the turbine by up to 30%.", "That's just the latest step in a story that's been unfolding for decades.", "These blades have been refined and perfected to the point where they operate right at the edge of what is physically possible.", "You're always on a knife-edge, pushing every material, every process to the limit to build an engine that can do the seemingly impossible, run hotter than its own melting point.", "The more I learned about the brutal environment these blades have to survive, the more it felt like they shouldn't work at all.", "And yet, they do.", "Every day, these machines carry millions of people across the world and we barely stop to think about them, they're a monument to human ingenuity.", "What happens when we refuse to accept limits, when we turn the impossible into the routine?", "(ominous music) (scene change zooms) (ominous music) I

Germany to present a lecture on his recent work. He had a slightly unusual presentation style. Physicist Eugene Wigner described the lecture as detached, almost like a recitation of a technical text. He said, \"The man spoke without giving any sign of enjoying his own lecture.\" But the work this strange unassuming man presented was about to send some of the most famous quantum physicists of the 20th century spiraling. (suspenseful music) After the lecture, Werner Heisenberg described the man's theory as, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" Heisenberg also wrote to Niels Bohr and said, \"I find the present situation quite absurd and, on that account, almost out of despair, I have taken up another field.\" Legend has it that Wolfgang Pauli even announced that he was abandoning quantum physics, and then he started writing a utopian novel. What had the young man said to disrupt the world of quantum mechanics so profoundly? But he had been working on a problem that physicists are still tackling today. The unification of Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics, and his work had revealed something troubling, a particle unlike any scene in the world, a particle with negative energy. (suspenseful music) In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity. It was based on the simple idea that for anyone moving with constant speed, the laws of physics should be the same, and this includes any measurement of the speed of light. So, it doesn't matter how you're moving relative to a beam of light, you should measure its speed to be 300 million meters per second. This means that things that we ordinarily think of as fixed, like time and space, have to transform, so that the speed of light is always measured to have the same value. In making this discovery, Einstein realized that space and time are not really separate dimensions at all. They're linked in a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. (pensive music) When Einstein applied this idea to an object emitting light, he found something peculiar. When an object loses energy by emitting photons, its mass must also decrease, and the change in the object's mass is equal to the energy of the photons emitted divided by the speed of light squared. In other words, he found that energy must be equal to mc squared. E equals mc squared. - [Einstein] Mass and energy are but different manifestations of the same thing. - So, a particle's total energy comes from its momentum and its rest mass, giving it new relationship between energy and momentum. (pensive music) Now, if we take the square root of both sides, we get an expression for the energy of a particle in terms of its mass and momentum. And if we plot energy versus momentum in a single dimension, we get this curve, where mc squared, the rest mass energy of the object, is the lowest possible value for energy. But really, when we took the square root, we should have put a plus/minus out front, which would give us two curves: one for positive energies and another for negative energies. But we don't observe things that have energy less than 0. I mean, what would that even mean? So, in classical physics, the solution is simple. You just ignore the negative energy solutions. They can't physically represent anything, right, Casper? - Well, sure, that sounds right. But around the same time that Einstein was coming up with his special theory of relativity, physicists began observing some strange phenomena in atomic physics that were overthrowing all of these classical assumptions. First of all, they noticed that when looking at the energy levels of subatomic particles, like electrons, they weren't continuous at all, they were discrete. And they also didn't just behave as particles, but as waves. So, if you would take electrons and fire them through two narrow slits, then they would create interference patterns, just like light does. What they were discovering was the new field of quantum mechanics. (suspenseful music) And in 1926, Erwin Schrodinger formalized this field by coming up with his now-famous wave equation, which describes how quantum mechanical systems evolve over time. - This was the most radical new theory of the 20th century, and would remain so. This is not a bit like Newton or a bit like Maxwell. This was radically new. - [Casper] The equation solution, called the wave function, psi, does not describe a particle with a precise position and momentum as classical laws would. But instead, the modular squared can give us the probability of finding the particle in a specific location at a specific time. - Deriving the Schrodinger equation is actually surprisingly simple. Just start by writing down the total energy, which, for a free particle, is just its kinetic energy, 1/2 mv squared. And we can rewrite it in terms of momentum, mass times velocity. So kinetic energy is just momentum squared divided by 2m. Now, we're going to make this quantum, and to do that, we need two things. The first is the wave function, psi, which describes how particles act as waves at quantum scales. And the second is something called a quantum operator. This is just a mathematical tool that extracts information from the wave function to reveal a specific property of the particle, like its position, energy, or momentum. The operators for energy and momentum look like this. By inputting these operators, we can make each side of the equation act on the wave function, and that gives us the Schrodinger equation for a free particle. (pensive music) For particles that aren't free, like electrons in atoms, you need to factor in potential energy, too, which gives you the full Schrodinger equation. (pensive music) - But there are some places where it doesn't produce the right prediction. For example, take the element gold. The Schrodinger equation suggests that it should be a silver gray color, just like all the other metals. But it's not, I mean, it's gold. And for mercury, the Schrodinger equation predicts that it should be a solid at room temperature, but it's a liquid. So, what is wrong? Well, I'll give you a hint, because both gold and mercury are heavy elements. - [Derek] They have a high number of protons in their nuclei, which attract orbiting electrons more strongly. So, if you're thinking in a classical sense, the electrons would be bound tighter in, and they'd be whizzing around at higher speeds than in other elements. And for electrons in some orbits, those speeds start to get a little too close to the speed of light. (pensive music) So, let's go back to the Schrodinger equation. There, we had the kinetic energy was p squared over 2m. But for particles moving at relativistic speeds close to the speed of light, that equation isn't the right one. The correct equation is the energy momentum relation from special relativity. - Schrodinger's equation is not consistent with the theory of relativity, so it's... Technically, it's not right. (pensive music) - So, the solution seems simple enough. Just start with the relativistic energy momentum relation and use that to derive a new wave equation. (pensive music) Well, this is exactly what a physicist named Oskar Klein did in 1926. He subbed in the same energy and momentum operators that Schrodinger used, and found this equation. (pensive music) Klein's work was pretty well-received by a number of his colleagues. In fact, it turned out the two other physicists, Walter Gordon and Vladimir Fock, had independently arrived at the same equation in that same year. It became known as the Klein-Gordon equation, which was a bit of a burn for Fock. (graphic whooshing) (graphic twinkling) But that's often how it goes. You do all the hard work and then no one notices. Things have changed a little since Fock's time, but the key to recognition is still visibility. And these days, that means having a website.

I wanna thank Hostinger for sponsoring this part of the video. And now, back to Klein, Gordon, and Fock. The Klein-Gordon-Fock equation even made its way over to one of the fathers of quantum physics, Niels Bohr, who must have been impressed, because at the 1927 Solvay Conference, Bohr was chatting to a promising young physicist about what he was working on. The young man said, \"I'm trying to get a relativistic theory of the electron.\" Bohr replied, \"But Klein has already solved this problem.\" The young man disagreed. So, who was this bold 25-year-old? He was Paul Dirac, a man who Bohr would later give the nickname The Strangest Man because he was truly one of a kind. - First time I went to Princeton, I met a couple who invited Dirac and his wife. And Dirac, for the whole meal, which lasted three hours, didn't say a single word. Not one word. He wasn't sulky, he wasn't angry. He just saw no reason to speak. - That's crazy. - [Derek] Dirac was a man of so few words that his colleagues invented a special unit, a Dirac, equivalent to speaking one word per hour. Legend also has it that he liked to relax by climbing trees in three-piece suits. And that wasn't his only strange hobby. As a student, Dirac had attended seminars on Einstein's theory of relativity, and he'd kind of fallen in love with it. He was impressed by the elegance and beauty of its mathematics. To Dirac, this got to the core of what a good theory must do. He once said, \"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.\" (pensive music) - [Casper] Do you know why Dirac was so drawn to relativity? - Einstein went in there and did it all... Not all, but almost all by deductive reasoning. That made a huge impression on Dirac, right? He realized that it was advanced mathematics was really important to understanding the way that nature works. - So, Dirac found a new hobby, obsessively updating classical equations with Einstein's theory of relativity, so that they would now work for relative physics scenarios as well that are those approaching the speed of light. He later said this was like a game for him, and so it's maybe not too much of a surprise then that he was one of the people trying to unite quantum physics and relativity because a theory that would cover both of these would be truly beautiful in his eyes. - Dirac didn't see the beauty in Klein, Gordon, and Fock's relativistic update of the Schrodinger equation, and he wasn't alone. Fellow physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, after reading Klein's paper, wrote him a letter, wishing his physics a speedy recovery. Pauli was known for being pretty savage. And actually, the Klein-Gordon equation is useful in some cases, but he and Dirac were both concerned with one particular feature of the equation. - And that's because the Klein-Gordon equation contains this term. That's a second-order time derivative. So the wave function is being differentiated twice with respect to time. Now, remember, the Schrodinger equation also contains a second-order derivative, but that's with space, not with time. Time is just first-order. So, why is this such a problem? Well, think of a very simple second-order time derivative. Something like d squared y over dt squared is equal to 3. Now, to figure out what y is, the function that satisfies this equation, we just have to integrate it twice. (pensive music) (record scratching) But notice, to find the solution, we now two integration constants, c and D. And the problem is that we can only find that if we know both y at a given time and if we know the first derivative of y at a given time. This makes sense physically, if you think about, say, throwing a ball in the air. If you want to predict the ball's future motion, well, then, you need to know where you threw it from, that's its position, and how hard you threw it, that's its velocity. Or in other words, you need to know both the position and the first derivative of the position. (suspenseful music) - Similarly, to predict a quantum systems future state using the Klein-Gordon equation, you'd need the initial wave function and the initial first derivative of the wave function. (suspenseful music) Now, the beauty of the Schrodinger equation was that if you knew only the wave function of a system at a given time, you could use it to determine all the future states of that system. But in the Klein-Gordon equation, the wave function no longer told the whole story. And this introduced a further problem. The probability of finding a particle in a given area could no longer be simply described by the modulus of the wave function, as it was for the Schrodinger equation. For the Klein-Gordon equation, a new equation was needed to describe the probability using the wave function, which takes a while to derive, so we won't get into that here, but it looks like this. And the problem with that equation is that unlike the simple modulus of the wave function, it can have negative solutions, negative probabilities. How can the chance of something happening be less than zero? As Dirac put it, that, of course, is physically nonsense. (suspenseful music) So, Dirac did what Dirac does best, and he set out to find his own solution that contained no second-order time derivatives. First, he rewrote the relativistic energy momentum relationship like this, which is a linear equation. So no squaring E, that is no squaring the energy operator, which is what gave rise to that second-order time derivative in the Klein-Gordon equation. Now, he just had to solve this equation and find the coefficients, alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta, and he would have a solution. (pensive music) To do this, we can start by squaring both sides of the equation. Next, we can expand the momentum on the left-hand side into its three dimensions, and then expand the right-hand side to end up with this long equation. It might look pretty complicated, but there is a trick we can use. (pensive music) And notice that all these terms on the right-hand side are multiplied by pmc cubed, but on the left-hand side, there are no terms containing pmc cubed. So that tells us that when you multiply these coefficients together, like the alpha times beta and beta times alphas, all of that must be 0. And similarly, notice that these terms are multiplied by two different momenta, like px and py times c squared, which also don't have a counterpart on the left-hand side. So these alpha times alpha terms must also be equal to 0. And that just leaves this top row. These terms do match on both sides, which tells us that alpha x squared must be equal to 1, and so must alpha y squared, alpha z squared, and beta squared. So Dirac now had a set of simultaneous equations for alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta that he just needed to solve. That sounds easy, right? But it's not that straightforward. - To see why, let's do some examples. So say alpha x is 1 and beta equals minus 1. Well, then, we get 1 squared, which is 1, equals minus 1 squared, which is also 1, so that satisfies the top equation. But if we fill it in here, we get 1 times minus 1, which is just minus 1, plus minus 1 times 1, which is, again, minus 1, for a total of minus 2. So, that doesn't work. So, let's try another number. Say alpha x is 1, and now it's alpha z that is minus 1. Well, in that case, we get 1 times minus 1. So, again, we get minus 1, plus minus, 1 times 1, again, minus 1. So we, again, get minus 2. And in fact, if you look at this top equation, the only numbers that satisfy this relation is 1 and minus 1. So all these coefficients have to be either 1 or minus 1, but if you fill that in, then the only two possible answers you're gonna get in these equations is minus 2 or positive 2. Now, the two equations that are giving problems are these two, and that's because alpha times beta is the same as beta times alpha. So, you're always gonna get minus 2 or 2. So, the only way to get out of this is to somehow make the order of multiplication matter. But where do you find something like that? (pensive music) - Let's think about a really simple vector, say 1 in the x-direction and 2 in the y-direction. If I reflect this vector along the line y equals x and then reflect it about the x-axis, I get this. But if I start again and instead reflect it first about the x-axis and then along y equals x, I get this, which is totally different. So, the order matters. How do we express this mathematically? We need some way to represent transformations, like reflections as a single coefficient, which means we need matrices. Matrices are arrays of numbers which encapsulate these transformations, telling us how to reflect, rotate, stretch, or squish across each dimension. Mathematically, the order we multiply them matters. Since we multiply the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second, (pensive music) (graphic whooshing) A matrix that reflects along y equals x looks like this and a matrix that reflects about the x-axis looks like this. (pensive music) And if I apply them to that original vector one by one, you can see how we end up with different results. (pensive music) And actually, using matrices in quantum mechanics was not completely out there. Dirac had already seen it done by Werner Heisenberg, his new, if unlikely, friend. Dirac and Heisenberg were very different characters. Heisenberg was charming and outgoing, Dirac hated socializing and small talk. Once the two were on a cruise ship to a conference together and Heisenberg spent a lot of time dancing with women on board. So, Dirac asked him, \"Why do you dance?\" Heisenberg replied, \"When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure.\" Dirac thought about this for a bit before saying, \"How do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?\" So, they were pretty different guys, but Heisenberg had a profound impact on Dirac. (upbeat music) - Do you know what drew him to quantum mechanics initially? - He always said that Heisenberg gave him his start, he always said that. In later life, he used to begin lectures when he was 70, even 80 years old, with the following words. - Quantum mechanics was discovered by Heisenberg in 1925. - As a PhD student, Dirac had closely followed Heisenberg's work, and a few years earlier, Heisenberg had founded for certain properties, like position and momentum. The order of multiplication matters. So x times p is not the same as p times x. This was actually the beginning of Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle, which says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of physical properties in quantum systems. It turns out that if the order of multiplication matters for two properties like position and momentum, then that means there's an inherent uncertainty in their combined measurements. The order we measure them in will change the outcome. Heisenberg's mentor, Max Born, suggested that he could represent this mathematically by using matrices, because there, the order of multiplication also matters. (pensive music) This led Heisenberg to a new form of quantum mechanics, which was mathematically equivalent to Schrodinger's equation, but it was based on matrix algebra. - Dirac recognized something similar in his coefficients where the order of multiplication clearly mattered. So, he thought matrices might be the solution. For his coefficients, he tried 2x2 matrices since they're the smallest, simplest matrices that could make the order of multiplication matter. He found that some worked with the equations. In fact, those reflection matrices we tried earlier worked well, but he just couldn't find solutions for all four coefficients that all worked together. - So this is not simple. Dirac is one of the smartest people of the 20th century in physics, right? But it was not easy. You don't have just to twiddle with bits of the Schrodinger equation. You'd have to do something completely radical. His working is in there, and you could see him really struggling. - Then, Dirac had a stroke of genius. He said, \"I suddenly realized that there was no need to stick to quantities, which can be represented by matrices with just two rows and columns. Why not go to four rows and columns?\" (compelling music) With these four 4x4 matrices, Dirac got these solutions to his simultaneous equations, a matrix with 1s on the diagonal is mathematically equivalent to a 1, and a whole array of 0s is the same thing as 0. So, all of the equations were satisfied. Dirac had found coefficients that worked. Now, we can substitute those matrices back into Dirac's linear equation, then rewrite the three momenta and alpha coefficients as vectors. And just as we did with the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations, we can use the energy and momentum operators to make both sides act on the wave function. If we substitute those operators in, we get Dirac's final equation for the relativistic free electron. (compelling music) The young man who spent his life looking for mathematical beauty had found, perhaps, his most beautiful equation of all. - The people were expecting the solution to be horrible, and it turned out to be a thing of beauty, right? It was something you look at and you think, \"That is absolutely amazing.\" It's a pattern that Dirac found deep in nature. Nothing like that has been seen in physics at that time. (suspenseful music) - To see some of that beauty, you only have to compare it to the Schrodinger equation, which you can see right here. Now, the two look very similar, but there is a lot hidden in the Dirac equation. First of all, it's relativistic, so it works at really, really high speeds because it uses Einstein's energy momentum relationship, unlike the Schrodinger equation which breaks down there. But what's even more beautiful is that if you look at this, Dirac's equation isn't just first order in time derivatives, it's also first order in spatial derivatives. Whereas the Schrodinger equation was second order in spatial derivatives. So you might wonder, \"Well, why does that matter?\" Well, because not only does going first order in all derivatives solve the second-order time derivative problem of the Klein-Gordon equation, it now also treats time and space symmetrically. And it becomes really important if you start thinking about relativity, where time and space are not separate dimensions, they're intertwined in a four dimensional spacetime. And while the Schrodinger equation had just a single component wave function, to make the wave function work with these 4x4 matrices, in Dirac's case, you actually need a wave function that has four components. So, it'll look something like this. Psi one, psi two, psi three, and psi four. - The four-component wave function means that the Dirac equation describes four possible states for any quantum system, which reveals something Schrödinger's single wave function didn't. An electron at a given energy level actually has two possible states due to different orientations of its intrinsic angular momentum, spin up and spin down. (pensive music) This spin creates a tiny magnetic field. So these two states are like tiny magnets pointing in opposite directions, and that has an interesting implication. Take hydrogen, which has one proton and one electron. Classically, the electron whizzes around the proton. But if you switch to the perspective of the electron, well, now, it's the proton that's moving. And since it's positively charged, that moving charge creates a magnetic field in the electron's frame of reference. So, now you've got this electron, which has its own mini magnetic field, interacting with a larger magnetic field, and that interaction will be slightly different for a spin up and a spin down electron. And as a result, some energy levels of the electron split into two closely-spaced energy levels. And you can actually see this if you zoom into the emission spectrum for a hydrogen atom. (suspenseful music) Schrödinger's equation didn't predict that splitting since it just had one solution for each energy level. But with Dirac's four-component solution, the top two wave functions now described two different spin states with two slightly different energies. - Dirac admitted himself that he had never set out to capture spin in his equation. - I started out this work without any intention at all of bringing in the spin of the electron. - [Casper] But hold on, because if an electron at a given energy level only has two possible spin states, then why do we have a four-component wave function? Why are there four states and not just two? (compelling music) - [Derek] Well, that's what brings us back to that 1928 lecture at the start, the one that seemed to drive even the most well-established quantum physicists mad. Because that strange man presenting his work was actually Paul Dirac sharing his new equation with the world. It was Dirac's beautiful equation that Heisenberg called, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" (somber music) - To understand why all those physicists were losing their minds, we only have to look at the simple case when a particle is at rest. This term right here describes the momentum. So, when the particle doesn't move, this becomes 0 and it drops out, which gives us this. Next, we can sub in the energy for this quantum operator to get this. So now, we know that beta times mc squared must be equal to the particle's energy. And if we write out beta and multiplied by mc squared, then we find two positive solutions and two negative solutions for the energy. So, negative energy solutions are baked right into the Dirac equation. (pensive music) This idea that a free electron could have negative energy was impossible for any of these physicists to accept. Because think about it. If electrons can have a negative energy, then that means that they could continually radiate positive energy, that is emit photons, and drop into lower and lower negative energy states. There would be no limit to how far they could fall into the negative energy abyss. (compelling music) - It looked like, to many very smart people, and Dirac was smart enough to know they had a point, that this equation, it got the mass and the magnetic moment of the electron. Yes, but on the other hand, it predicts this ridiculous situation, where you have negative energy values. - Right. - That's nonsense. So, Heisenberg said, \"I give up. This is just ridiculous.\" So, Dirac, he had, in some very clear sense, had to rescue his equation. (pensive music) - [Derek] Dirac spent three years sticking to his guns. He tried all sorts of ways to interpret his new equation to explain where the negative energy was coming from. Then, in 1931, he proposed something radical to explain the negative energy solutions. (suspenseful music) A new kind of particle unknown to experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron. We may call such a particle an anti-electron. We should not expect to find any of them in nature on account of their rapid rate of recombination with electrons. (suspenseful music) So, Dirac was proposing that those four states described in his four-component wave function are a spin up electron, a spin down electron, a spin up antielectron, and a spin down antielectron. - When Dirac said that, people didn't start running around saying, \"Where's this antielectron?\" They just ignored it. - Yeah. - Cut to the laboratory at Caltech. - In 1932, a Caltech postdoc named Carl Anderson was working on a project trying to identify the charge particles produced by cosmic rays. He photographed the tracks these particles left in a cloud chamber containing a uniform magnetic field. Anderson noticed several instances of a similar track. It looked a lot like the tracks he'd seen left by electrons. Only, it curved in the opposite direction in the magnetic field. Kind of like the tracks of positively charged protons. But there was no way it could be a proton based on the length of the track. It had traveled farther in air, and therefore it had to be much lighter. It had to be something with around the same mass as an electron, but opposite charge. A positive electron, or as he named it, a positron. He actually also tried to rebrand electrons as negatrons, but that one didn't quite stick. Just one year after Dirac proposed the antielectron, Carl Anderson found it entirely by accident. (uplifting music) - But this alone doesn't get rid of the negative energy problem. Remember what we said earlier. If any particles, like these positrons, can have negative energy, then they could continually radiate energy and drop into lower and lower negative energy states. Fortunately, Dirac proposed a solution to this problem as well, although it was a little crazy. (suspenseful music) - He theorized something called the Dirac sea, describing a vacuum as an infinite sea of electrons occupying all available negative energy states. And since no two electrons can occupy the same state, this prevents observable positive energy electrons from falling into the negative energy states. A hole or vacancy in this sea then becomes a positron. When an electron and a positron meet and annihilate, well, that's just an electron falling back into the sea and filling that hole. The theory is mathematically sound. Of course, it's Dirac we're talking about, but if you feel like it's hard to come to terms with the idea that we're floating on an infinite sea of electrons, well, you wouldn't be alone. - It's not even that crazy if, I don't know, several decades later, people find that exact model in a physical system. In condensed matter physics, you see an exact analogy of also having electrons in the conduction band and say valence-covalence band. - Yes, that's true. That's true. But Dirac really was, you know, out there. You see what I mean? Maybe it was people like... He doesn't see it, really seeing that people are saying, \"This is nonsense.\" But it was a way of Dirac's rectilinear thinking, thinking, \"Well maybe this is...\" And then it drove him to antimatter. - Thankfully, in 1941, a Swiss physicist named Ernst Stueckelberg had a clever idea. The way function contains a term that looks like this, where energy is multiplied by time. So, we can see that if we just change the sign of time when the energy is negative, then we get the same result because a negative multiplied by a negative gives us a positive. Stueckelberg took this, and he suggested that negative energy electrons traveling backwards in time are mathematically equivalent to positive energy antielectrons, that is positrons, traveling forwards in time. - A few years later, around 1948, Richard Feynman took this idea and used it in one of the most powerful tools in modern physics, the Feynman diagrams. In his sketches of particle interactions, he showed antiparticles traveling the opposite way to particles backwards in time. (pensive music) It was a brilliant trick. Negative energy solutions no longer had to mean there was negative energy or a Dirac sea. They simply indicated the presence of an antiparticle. (suspenseful music) We now know that there's a corresponding antiparticle for every subatomic particle, with the same mass, but opposite charge. So, the proton has the antiproton, the neutrino has the antineutrino, and so on. - According to his friend, Heisenberg, that was the biggest leap in 20th-century physics to say there's a whole slew of antiparticles corresponding to particles, and Dirac got that through this crazy model. (pensive music) - But all is not solved. This new antiworld introduces some big questions about the very nature of our universe. Because particles and their antiparticles are equal and opposite, when they come together, they annihilate and produce two photons with energy equivalent to their mass and kinetic energy. And this process is reversible. Two photons with the right energies can produce a matter and antimatter pair. This is called Breit-Wheeler pair production. (suspenseful music) (Big Bang exploding) During the first moments after the Big Bang, the universe was hot, dense, and full of these pairs popping into and out of existence. If an equal number of matter and antimatter particles were created, you would expect them to all annihilate each other in this dense environment, leaving behind only energy. But that didn't happen. We ended up with a universe full of matter. If we work backwards from how much matter and antimatter is in the universe today, it's actually estimated that only one particle per billion of matter needed to survive this hot, dense era and not get annihilated. That tiny difference would give us the makeup of our universe today, where matter dominates. - So what allowed that one particle per billion to escape annihilation? Why did matter win out over antimatter? (compelling music) Well, that's a pretty big question with some not so simple answers. So, we're doing an entire second video where we have some pretty spectacular stuff happening. We're getting into the beast. It's absolutely insane. I feel like I should not be in here. So you're making anti-atoms? - Yes. (energy humming) - [Casper] It's so cool. (compelling music) - Dirac is probably less well-known than people like Heisenberg or Schrödinger, but his contribution to quantum physics was immense, and he was recognized for it. He shared the 1933 Nobel Prize with Schrödinger for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory. And perhaps this gave strange, quiet Dirac some newfound confidence, because that physicist in the audience of his 1928 lecture at the start, Eugene Wigner, actually became a reasonable friend of Dirac's. And in 1934, introduced Dirac to his sister, Margit Wigner, a woman who would change Dirac's life, perhaps more than any equation or Nobel Prize. (pensive music) - They were antiparticles, right? They had completely different personalities. He had almost no empathy, right? And he knew it. She had buckets of it. He hardly talked, she couldn't stop talking. You could just go on, like they are completely different people. But the marriage did work. My great friend Lilia Harris Chandra, who knew them, she came out with a great line, great line, which is, \"He gave her status, she gave him a life.\" - So, I guess there is one particle-antiparticle pair that never annihilated.

had a slightly unusual presentation style.", "Physicist Eugene Wigner described the lecture as detached, almost like a recitation of a technical text.", "He said, \"The man spoke without giving any sign of enjoying his own lecture.\" But the work this strange unassuming man presented was about to send some of the most famous quantum physicists of the 20th century spiraling.", "(suspenseful music) After the lecture, Werner Heisenberg described the man's theory as, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" Heisenberg also wrote to Niels Bohr and said, \"I find the present situation quite absurd and, on that account, almost out of despair, I have taken up another field.\" Legend has it that Wolfgang Pauli even announced that he was abandoning quantum physics, and then he started writing a utopian novel.", "What had the young man said to disrupt the world of quantum mechanics so profoundly?", "But he had been working on a problem that physicists are still tackling today.", "The unification of Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics, and his work had revealed something troubling, a particle unlike any scene in the world, a particle with negative energy.", "(suspenseful music) In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity.", "It was based on the simple idea that for anyone moving with constant speed, the laws of physics should be the same, and this includes any measurement of the speed of light.", "So, it doesn't matter how you're moving relative to a beam of light, you should measure its speed to be 300 million meters per second.", "This means that things that we ordinarily think of as fixed, like time and space, have to transform, so that the speed of light is always measured to have the same value.", "In making this discovery, Einstein realized that space and time are not really separate dimensions at all.", "They're linked in a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime.", "(pensive music) When Einstein applied this idea to an object emitting light, he found something peculiar.", "When an object loses energy by emitting photons, its mass must also decrease, and the change in the object's mass is equal to the energy of the photons emitted divided by the speed of light squared.", "In other words, he found that energy must be equal to mc squared.", "E equals mc squared.", "- [Einstein] Mass and energy are but different manifestations of the same thing.", "- So, a particle's total energy comes from its momentum and its rest mass, giving it new relationship between energy and momentum.", "(pensive music) Now, if we take the square root of both sides, we get an expression for the energy of a particle in terms of its mass and momentum.", "And if we plot energy versus momentum in a single dimension, we get this curve, where mc squared, the rest mass energy of the object, is the lowest possible value for energy.", "But really, when we took the square root, we should have put a plus/minus out front, which would give us two curves: one for positive energies and another for negative energies.", "But we don't observe things that have energy less than 0.", "I mean, what would that even mean?", "So, in classical physics, the solution is simple.", "You just ignore the negative energy solutions.", "They can't physically represent anything, right, Casper?", "- Well, sure, that sounds right.", "But around the same time that Einstein was coming up with his special theory of relativity, physicists began observing some strange phenomena in atomic physics that were overthrowing all of these classical assumptions.", "First of all, they noticed that when looking at the energy levels of subatomic particles, like electrons, they weren't continuous at all, they were discrete.", "And they also didn't just behave as particles, but as waves.", "So, if you would take electrons and fire them through two narrow slits, then they would create interference patterns, just like light does.", "What they were discovering was the new field of quantum mechanics.", "(suspenseful music) And in 1926, Erwin Schrodinger formalized this field by coming up with his now-famous wave equation, which describes how quantum mechanical systems evolve over time.", "- This was the most radical new theory of the 20th century, and would remain so.", "This is not a bit like Newton or a bit like Maxwell.", "This was radically new.", "- [Casper] The equation solution, called the wave function, psi, does not describe a particle with a precise position and momentum as classical laws would.", "But instead, the modular squared can give us the probability of finding the particle in a specific location at a specific time.", "- Deriving the Schrodinger equation is actually surprisingly simple.", "Just start by writing down the total energy, which, for a free particle, is just its kinetic energy, 1/2 mv squared.", "And we can rewrite it in terms of momentum, mass times velocity.", "So kinetic energy is just momentum squared divided by 2m.", "Now, we're going to make this quantum, and to do that, we need two things.", "The first is the wave function, psi, which describes how particles act as waves at quantum scales.", "And the second is something called a quantum operator.", "This is just a mathematical tool that extracts information from the wave function to reveal a specific property of the particle, like its position, energy, or momentum.", "The operators for energy and momentum look like this.", "By inputting these operators, we can make each side of the equation act on the wave function, and that gives us the Schrodinger equation for a free particle.", "(pensive music) For particles that aren't free, like electrons in atoms, you need to factor in potential energy, too, which gives you the full Schrodinger equation.", "(pensive music) - But there are some places where it doesn't produce the right prediction.", "For example, take the element gold.", "The Schrodinger equation suggests that it should be a silver gray color, just like all the other metals.", "But it's not, I mean, it's gold.", "And for mercury, the Schrodinger equation predicts that it should be a solid at room temperature, but it's a liquid.", "So, what is wrong?", "Well, I'll give you a hint, because both gold and mercury are heavy elements.", "- [Derek] They have a high number of protons in their nuclei, which attract orbiting electrons more strongly.", "So, if you're thinking in a classical sense, the electrons would be bound tighter in, and they'd be whizzing around at higher speeds than in other elements.", "And for electrons in some orbits, those speeds start to get a little too close to the speed of light.", "(pensive music) So, let's go back to the Schrodinger equation.", "There, we had the kinetic energy was p squared over 2m.", "But for particles moving at relativistic speeds close to the speed of light, that equation isn't the right one.", "The correct equation is the energy momentum relation from special relativity.", "- Schrodinger's equation is not consistent with the theory of relativity, so it's...", "Technically, it's not right.", "(pensive music) - So, the solution seems simple enough.", "Just start with the relativistic energy momentum relation and use that to derive a new wave equation.", "(pensive music) Well, this is exactly what a physicist named Oskar Klein did in 1926.", "He subbed in the same energy and momentum operators that Schrodinger used, and found this equation.", "(pensive music) Klein's work was pretty well-received by a number of his colleagues.", "In fact, it turned out the two other physicists, Walter Gordon and Vladimir Fock, had independently arrived at the same equation in that same year.", "It became known as the Klein-Gordon equation, which was a bit of a burn for Fock.", "(graphic whooshing) (graphic twinkling) But that's often how it goes.", "You do all the hard work and then no one notices.", "Things have changed a little since Fock's time, but the key to recognition is still visibility.", "And these days, that means having a website.", "Simple enough, you just need to write a couple thousand lines of CSS, JavaScript, or HTML, or else pay someone a few thousand dollars to do it for you.", "Oh, and then there's the hosting costs and the maintenance.", "Or you could check out today's

the sale and use the code VERITASIUM for an extra 10% off.", "Just scan this QR code or follow the link in the description to get started.", "I wanna thank Hostinger for sponsoring this part of the video.", "And now, back to Klein, Gordon, and Fock.", "The Klein-Gordon-Fock equation even made its way over to one of the fathers of quantum physics, Niels Bohr, who must have been impressed, because at the 1927 Solvay Conference, Bohr was chatting to a promising young physicist about what he was working on.", "The young man said, \"I'm trying to get a relativistic theory of the electron.\" Bohr replied, \"But Klein has already solved this problem.\" The young man disagreed.", "So, who was this bold 25-year-old?", "He was Paul Dirac, a man who Bohr would later give the nickname The Strangest Man because he was truly one of a kind.", "- First time I went to Princeton, I met a couple who invited Dirac and his wife.", "And Dirac, for the whole meal, which lasted three hours, didn't say a single word.", "Not one word.", "He wasn't sulky, he wasn't angry.", "He just saw no reason to speak.", "- That's crazy.", "- [Derek] Dirac was a man of so few words that his colleagues invented a special unit, a Dirac, equivalent to speaking one word per hour.", "Legend also has it that he liked to relax by climbing trees in three-piece suits.", "And that wasn't his only strange hobby.", "As a student, Dirac had attended seminars on Einstein's theory of relativity, and he'd kind of fallen in love with it.", "He was impressed by the elegance and beauty of its mathematics.", "To Dirac, this got to the core of what a good theory must do.", "He once said, \"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.\" (pensive music) - [Casper] Do you know why Dirac was so drawn to relativity?", "- Einstein went in there and did it all...", "Not all, but almost all by deductive reasoning.", "That made a huge impression on Dirac, right?", "He realized that it was advanced mathematics was really important to understanding the way that nature works.", "- So, Dirac found a new hobby, obsessively updating classical equations with Einstein's theory of relativity, so that they would now work for relative physics scenarios as well that are those approaching the speed of light.", "He later said this was like a game for him, and so it's maybe not too much of a surprise then that he was one of the people trying to unite quantum physics and relativity because a theory that would cover both of these would be truly beautiful in his eyes.", "- Dirac didn't see the beauty in Klein, Gordon, and Fock's relativistic update of the Schrodinger equation, and he wasn't alone.", "Fellow physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, after reading Klein's paper, wrote him a letter, wishing his physics a speedy recovery.", "Pauli was known for being pretty savage.", "And actually, the Klein-Gordon equation is useful in some cases, but he and Dirac were both concerned with one particular feature of the equation.", "- And that's because the Klein-Gordon equation contains this term.", "That's a second-order time derivative.", "So the wave function is being differentiated twice with respect to time.", "Now, remember, the Schrodinger equation also contains a second-order derivative, but that's with space, not with time.", "Time is just first-order.", "So, why is this such a problem?", "Well, think of a very simple second-order time derivative.", "Something like d squared y over dt squared is equal to 3.", "Now, to figure out what y is, the function that satisfies this equation, we just have to integrate it twice.", "(pensive music) (record scratching) But notice, to find the solution, we now two integration constants, c and D.", "And the problem is that we can only find that if we know both y at a given time and if we know the first derivative of y at a given time.", "This makes sense physically, if you think about, say, throwing a ball in the air.", "If you want to predict the ball's future motion, well, then, you need to know where you threw it from, that's its position, and how hard you threw it, that's its velocity.", "Or in other words, you need to know both the position and the first derivative of the position.", "(suspenseful music) - Similarly, to predict a quantum systems future state using the Klein-Gordon equation, you'd need the initial wave function and the initial first derivative of the wave function.", "(suspenseful music) Now, the beauty of the Schrodinger equation was that if you knew only the wave function of a system at a given time, you could use it to determine all the future states of that system.", "But in the Klein-Gordon equation, the wave function no longer told the whole story.", "And this introduced a further problem.", "The probability of finding a particle in a given area could no longer be simply described by the modulus of the wave function, as it was for the Schrodinger equation.", "For the Klein-Gordon equation, a new equation was needed to describe the probability using the wave function, which takes a while to derive, so we won't get into that here, but it looks like this.", "And the problem with that equation is that unlike the simple modulus of the wave function, it can have negative solutions, negative probabilities.", "How can the chance of something happening be less than zero?", "As Dirac put it, that, of course, is physically nonsense.", "(suspenseful music) So, Dirac did what Dirac does best, and he set out to find his own solution that contained no second-order time derivatives.", "First, he rewrote the relativistic energy momentum relationship like this, which is a linear equation.", "So no squaring E, that is no squaring the energy operator, which is what gave rise to that second-order time derivative in the Klein-Gordon equation.", "Now, he just had to solve this equation and find the coefficients, alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta, and he would have a solution.", "(pensive music) To do this, we can start by squaring both sides of the equation.", "Next, we can expand the momentum on the left-hand side into its three dimensions, and then expand the right-hand side to end up with this long equation.", "It might look pretty complicated, but there is a trick we can use.", "(pensive music) And notice that all these terms on the right-hand side are multiplied by pmc cubed, but on the left-hand side, there are no terms containing pmc cubed.", "So that tells us that when you multiply these coefficients together, like the alpha times beta and beta times alphas, all of that must be 0.", "And similarly, notice that these terms are multiplied by two different momenta, like px and py times c squared, which also don't have a counterpart on the left-hand side.", "So these alpha times alpha terms must also be equal to 0.", "And that just leaves this top row.", "These terms do match on both sides, which tells us that alpha x squared must be equal to 1, and so must alpha y squared, alpha z squared, and beta squared.", "So Dirac now had a set of simultaneous equations for alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta that he just needed to solve.", "That sounds easy, right?", "But it's not that straightforward.", "- To see why, let's do some examples.", "So say alpha x is 1 and beta equals minus 1.", "Well, then, we get 1 squared, which is 1, equals minus 1 squared, which is also 1, so that satisfies the top equation.", "But if we fill it in here, we get 1 times minus 1, which is just minus 1, plus minus 1 times 1, which is, again, minus 1, for a total of minus 2.", "So, that doesn't work.", "So, let's try another number.", "Say alpha x is 1, and now it's alpha z that is minus 1.", "Well, in that case, we get 1 times minus 1.", "So, again, we get minus 1, plus minus, 1 times 1, again, minus 1.", "So we, again, get minus 2.", "And in fact, if you look at this top equation, the only numbers that satisfy this relation is 1 and minus 1.", "So all these coefficients have to be either 1 or minus 1, but if you fill that in, then the only two possible answers you're gonna get in these equations is minus 2 or positive 2.", "Now, the two equations that are giving problems are these two, and that's because alpha times beta is the same as beta times alpha.", "So, you're always gonna get minus 2 or 2.", "So, the only way to get out of this is to somehow make the order of multiplication matter.", "But where do you find something like that?", "(pensive music) - Let's think about a really simple vector, say 1 in the x-direction and 2 in the y-direction.", "If I reflect this vector along the line y equals x and then reflect it about the x-axis, I get this.", "But if I start again and instead reflect it first about the x-axis and then along y equals x, I get this, which is totally different.", "So, the order matters.", "How do we express this mathematically?", "We need some way to represent transformations, like reflections as a single coefficient, which means we need matrices.", "Matrices are arrays of numbers which encapsulate these transformations, telling us how to reflect, rotate, stretch, or squish across each dimension.", "Mathematically, the order we multiply them matters.", "Since we multiply the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second, (pensive music) (graphic whooshing) A matrix that reflects along y equals x looks like this and a matrix that reflects about the x-axis looks like this.", "(pensive music) And if I apply them to that original vector one by one, you can see how we end up with different results.", "(pensive music) And actually, using matrices in quantum mechanics was not completely out there.", "Dirac had already seen it done by Werner Heisenberg, his new, if unlikely, friend.", "Dirac and Heisenberg were very different characters.", "Heisenberg was charming and outgoing, Dirac hated socializing and small talk.", "Once the two were on a cruise ship to a conference together and Heisenberg spent a lot of time dancing with women on board.", "So, Dirac asked him, \"Why do you dance?\" Heisenberg replied, \"When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure.\" Dirac thought about this for a bit before saying, \"How do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?\" So, they were pretty different guys, but Heisenberg had a profound impact on Dirac.", "(upbeat music) - Do you know what drew him to quantum mechanics initially?", "- He always said that Heisenberg gave him his start, he always said that.", "In later life, he used to begin lectures when he was 70, even 80 years old, with the following words.", "- Quantum mechanics was discovered by Heisenberg in 1925.", "- As a PhD student, Dirac had closely followed Heisenberg's work, and a few years earlier, Heisenberg had founded for certain properties, like position and momentum.", "The order of multiplication matters.", "So x times p is not the same as p times x.", "This was actually the beginning of Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle, which says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of physical properties in quantum systems.", "It turns out that if the order of multiplication matters for two properties like position and momentum, then that means there's an inherent uncertainty in their combined measurements.", "The order we measure them in will change the outcome.", "Heisenberg's mentor, Max Born, suggested that he could represent this mathematically by using matrices, because there, the order of multiplication also matters.", "(pensive music) This led Heisenberg to a new form of quantum mechanics, which was mathematically equivalent to Schrodinger's equation, but it was based on matrix algebra.", "- Dirac recognized something similar in his coefficients where the order of multiplication clearly mattered.", "So, he thought matrices might be the solution.", "For his coefficients, he tried 2x2 matrices since they're the smallest, simplest matrices that could make the order of multiplication matter.", "He found that some worked with the equations.", "In fact, those reflection matrices we tried earlier worked well, but he just couldn't find solutions for all four coefficients that all worked together.", "- So this is not simple.", "Dirac is one of the smartest people of the 20th century in physics, right?", "But it was not easy.", "You don't have just to twiddle with bits of the Schrodinger equation.", "You'd have to do something completely radical.", "His working is in there, and you could see him really struggling.", "- Then, Dirac had a stroke of genius.", "He said, \"I suddenly realized that there was no need to stick to quantities, which can be represented by matrices with just two rows and columns.", "Why not go to four rows and columns?\" (compelling music) With these four 4x4 matrices, Dirac got these solutions to his simultaneous equations, a matrix with 1s on the diagonal is mathematically equivalent to a 1, and a whole array of 0s is the same thing as 0.", "So, all of the equations were satisfied.", "Dirac had found coefficients that worked.", "Now, we can substitute those matrices back into Dirac's linear equation, then rewrite the three momenta and alpha coefficients as vectors.", "And just as we did with the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations, we can use the energy and momentum operators to make both sides act on the wave function.", "If we substitute those operators in, we get Dirac's final equation for the relativistic free electron.", "(compelling music) The young man who spent his life looking for mathematical beauty had found, perhaps, his most beautiful equation of all.", "- The people were expecting the solution to be horrible, and it turned out to be a thing of beauty, right?", "It was something you look at and you think, \"That is absolutely amazing.\" It's a pattern that Dirac found deep in nature.", "Nothing like that has been seen in physics at that time.", "(suspenseful music) - To see some of that beauty, you only have to compare it to the Schrodinger equation, which you can see right here.", "Now, the two look very similar, but there is a lot hidden in the Dirac equation.", "First of all, it's relativistic, so it works at really, really high speeds because it uses Einstein's energy momentum relationship, unlike the Schrodinger equation which breaks down there.", "But what's even more beautiful is that if you look at this, Dirac's equation isn't just first order in time derivatives, it's also first order in spatial derivatives.", "Whereas the Schrodinger equation was second order in spatial derivatives.", "So you might wonder, \"Well, why does that matter?\" Well, because not only does going first order in all derivatives solve the second-order time derivative problem of the Klein-Gordon equation, it now also treats time and space symmetrically.", "And it becomes really important if you start thinking about relativity, where time and space are not separate dimensions, they're intertwined in a four dimensional spacetime.", "And while the Schrodinger equation had just a single component wave function, to make the wave function work with these 4x4 matrices, in Dirac's case, you actually need a wave function that has four components.", "So, it'll look something like this.", "Psi one, psi two, psi three, and psi four.", "- The four-component wave function means that the Dirac equation describes four possible states for any quantum system, which reveals something Schrödinger's single wave function didn't.", "An electron at a given energy level actually has two possible states due to different orientations of its intrinsic angular momentum, spin up and spin down.", "(pensive music) This spin creates a tiny magnetic field.", "So these two states are like tiny magnets pointing in opposite directions, and that has an interesting implication.", "Take hydrogen, which has one proton and one electron.", "Classically, the electron whizzes around the proton.", "But if you switch to the perspective of the electron, well, now, it's the proton that's moving.", "And since it's positively charged, that moving charge creates a magnetic field in the electron's frame of reference.", "So, now you've got this electron, which has its own mini magnetic field, interacting with a larger magnetic field, and that interaction will be slightly different for a spin up and a spin down electron.", "And as a result, some energy levels of the electron split into two closely-spaced energy levels.", "And you can actually see this if you zoom into the emission spectrum for a hydrogen atom.", "(suspenseful music) Schrödinger's equation didn't predict that splitting since it just had one solution for each energy level.", "But with Dirac's four-component solution, the top two wave functions now described two different spin states with two slightly different energies.", "- Dirac admitted himself that he had never set out to capture spin in his equation.", "- I started out this work without any intention at all of bringing in the spin of the electron.", "- [Casper] But hold on, because if an electron at a given energy level only has two possible spin states, then why do we have a four-component wave function?", "Why are there four states and not just two?", "(compelling music) - [Derek] Well, that's what brings us back to that 1928 lecture at the start, the one that seemed to drive even the most well-established quantum physicists mad.", "Because that strange man presenting his work was actually Paul Dirac sharing his new equation with the world.", "It was Dirac's beautiful equation that Heisenberg called, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" (somber music) - To understand why all those physicists were losing their minds, we only have to look at the simple case when a particle is at rest.", "This term right here describes the momentum.", "So, when the particle doesn't move, this becomes 0 and it drops out, which gives us this.", "Next, we can sub in the energy for this quantum operator to get this.", "So now, we know that beta times mc squared must be equal to the particle's energy.", "And if we write out beta and multiplied by mc squared, then we find two positive solutions and two negative solutions for the energy.", "So, negative energy solutions are baked right into the Dirac equation.", "(pensive music) This idea that a free electron could have negative energy was impossible for any of these physicists to accept.", "Because think about it.", "If electrons can have a negative energy, then that means that they could continually radiate positive energy, that is emit photons, and drop into lower and lower negative energy states.", "There would be no limit to how far they could fall into the negative energy abyss.", "(compelling music) - It looked like, to many very smart people, and Dirac was smart enough to know they had a point, that this equation, it got the mass and the magnetic moment of the electron.", "Yes, but on the other hand, it predicts this ridiculous situation, where you have negative energy values.", "- Right.", "- That's nonsense.", "So, Heisenberg said, \"I give up.", "This is just ridiculous.\" So, Dirac, he had, in some very clear sense, had to rescue his equation.", "(pensive music) - [Derek] Dirac spent three years sticking to his guns.", "He tried all sorts of ways to interpret his new equation to explain where the negative energy was coming from.", "Then, in 1931, he proposed something radical to explain the negative energy solutions.", "(suspenseful music) A new kind of particle unknown to experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron.", "We may call such a particle an anti-electron.", "We should not expect to find any of them in nature on account of their rapid rate of recombination with electrons.", "(suspenseful music) So, Dirac was proposing that those four states described in his four-component wave function are a spin up electron, a spin down electron, a spin up antielectron, and a spin down antielectron.", "- When Dirac said that, people didn't start running around saying, \"Where's this antielectron?\" They just ignored it.", "- Yeah.", "- Cut to the laboratory at Caltech.", "- In 1932, a Caltech postdoc named Carl Anderson was working on a project trying to identify the charge particles produced by cosmic rays.", "He photographed the tracks these particles left in a cloud chamber containing a uniform magnetic field.", "Anderson noticed several instances of a similar track.", "It looked a lot like the tracks he'd seen left by electrons.", "Only, it curved in the opposite direction in the magnetic field.", "Kind of like the tracks of positively charged protons.", "But there was no way it could be a proton based on the length of the track.", "It had traveled farther in air, and therefore it had to be much lighter.", "It had to be something with around the same mass as an electron, but opposite charge.", "A positive electron, or as he named it, a positron.", "He actually also tried to rebrand electrons as negatrons, but that one didn't quite stick.", "Just one year after Dirac proposed the antielectron, Carl Anderson found it entirely by accident.", "(uplifting music) - But this alone doesn't get rid of the negative energy problem.", "Remember what we said earlier.", "If any particles, like these positrons, can have negative energy, then they could continually radiate energy and drop into lower and lower negative energy states.", "Fortunately, Dirac proposed a solution to this problem as well, although it was a little crazy.", "(suspenseful music) - He theorized something called the Dirac sea, describing a vacuum as an infinite sea of electrons occupying all available negative energy states.", "And since no two electrons can occupy the same state, this prevents observable positive energy electrons from falling into the negative energy states.", "A hole or vacancy in this sea then becomes a positron.", "When an electron and a positron meet and annihilate, well, that's just an electron falling back into the sea and filling that hole.", "The theory is mathematically sound.", "Of course, it's Dirac we're talking about, but if you feel like it's hard to come to terms with the idea that we're floating on an infinite sea of electrons, well, you wouldn't be alone.", "- It's not even that crazy if, I don't know, several decades later, people find that exact model in a physical system.", "In condensed matter physics, you see an exact analogy of also having electrons in the conduction band and say valence-covalence band.", "- Yes, that's true.", "That's true.", "But Dirac really was, you know, out there.", "You see what I mean?", "Maybe it was people like...", "He doesn't see it, really seeing that people are saying, \"This is nonsense.\" But it was a way of Dirac's rectilinear thinking, thinking, \"Well maybe this is...\" And then it drove him to antimatter.", "- Thankfully, in 1941, a Swiss physicist named Ernst Stueckelberg had a clever idea.", "The way function contains a term that looks like this, where energy is multiplied by time.", "So, we can see that if we just change the sign of time when the energy is negative, then we get the same result because a negative multiplied by a negative gives us a positive.", "Stueckelberg took this, and he suggested that negative energy electrons traveling backwards in time are mathematically equivalent to positive energy antielectrons, that is positrons, traveling forwards in time.", "- A few years later, around 1948, Richard Feynman took this idea and used it in one of the most powerful tools in modern physics, the Feynman diagrams.", "In his sketches of particle interactions, he showed antiparticles traveling the opposite way to particles backwards in time.", "(pensive music) It was a brilliant trick.", "Negative energy solutions no longer had to mean there was negative energy or a Dirac sea.", "They simply indicated the presence of an antiparticle.", "(suspenseful music) We now know that there's a corresponding antiparticle for every subatomic particle, with the same mass, but opposite charge.", "So, the proton has the antiproton, the neutrino has the antineutrino, and so on.", "- According to his friend, Heisenberg, that was the biggest leap in 20th-century physics to say there's a whole slew of antiparticles corresponding to particles, and Dirac got that through this crazy model.", "(pensive music) - But all is not solved.", "This new antiworld introduces some big questions about the very nature of our universe.", "Because particles and their antiparticles are equal and opposite, when they come together, they annihilate and produce two photons with energy equivalent to their mass and kinetic energy.", "And this process is reversible.", "Two photons with the right energies can produce a matter and antimatter pair.", "This is called Breit-Wheeler pair production.", "(suspenseful music) (Big Bang exploding) During the first moments after the Big Bang, the universe was hot, dense, and full of these pairs popping into and out of existence.", "If an equal number of matter and antimatter particles were created, you would expect them to all annihilate each other in this dense environment, leaving behind only energy.", "But that didn't happen.", "We ended up with a universe full of matter.", "If we work backwards from how much matter and antimatter is in the universe today, it's actually estimated that only one particle per billion of matter needed to survive this hot, dense era and not get annihilated.", "That tiny difference would give us the makeup of our universe today, where matter dominates.", "- So what allowed that one particle per billion to escape annihilation?", "Why did matter win out over antimatter?", "(compelling music) Well, that's a pretty big question with some not so simple answers.", "So, we're doing an entire second video where we have some pretty spectacular stuff happening.", "We're getting into the beast.", "It's absolutely insane.", "I feel like I should not be in here.", "So you're making anti-atoms?", "- Yes.", "(energy humming) - [Casper] It's so cool.", "(compelling music) - Dirac is probably less well-known than people like Heisenberg or Schrödinger, but his contribution to quantum physics was immense, and he was recognized for it.", "He shared the 1933 Nobel Prize with Schrödinger for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory.", "And perhaps this gave strange, quiet Dirac some newfound confidence, because that physicist in the audience of his 1928 lecture at the start, Eugene Wigner, actually became a reasonable friend of Dirac's.", "And in 1934, introduced Dirac to his sister, Margit Wigner, a woman who would change Dirac's life, perhaps more than any equation or Nobel Prize.", "(pensive music) - They were antiparticles, right?", "They had completely different personalities.", "He had almost no empathy, right?", "And he knew it.", "She had buckets of it.", "He hardly talked, she couldn't stop talking.", "You could just go on, like they are completely different people.", "But the marriage did work.", "My great friend Lilia Harris Chandra, who knew them, she came out with a great line, great line, which is, \"He gave her status, she gave him a life.\" - So, I guess there is one particle-antiparticle pair that never annihilated.", "(pensive music) (graphic beeping) (pensive music) - Hey, one last thing, in case you didn't already know, we just launched the official Veritasium game.", "It comes with 800 questions, and it's the perfect way to challenge your friends.", "Every time we play it at Veritasium, things get a little bit heated, and that is so much fun.", "If you want to go check it out, then head over to our Kickstarter, where you can pre-order your own version.", "And right now, we've enabled global shipping, so no matter where you are in the world, you can get your own version.", "We're coming close to the final few days of the Kickstarter campaign.", "So, this is your last chance to get your hands on the exclusive launch edition.", "So, if you wanna support us, head over to Kickstarter by clicking the link in the

[music] [music] [music] Once they've re kind of reached Once they've re kind of reached Once they've re kind of reached maturity, they're transferred out to maturity, they're transferred out to maturity, they're transferred out to ocean farms.

To sum it up, soy farming can be a major cause of deforestation, can be a major cause of deforestation, can be a major cause of deforestation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. water pollution, and biodiversity loss. water pollution, and biodiversity loss. And a lot of the demand is driven by a And a lot of the demand is driven by a And a lot of the demand is driven by a need to feed farm animals. But in the need to feed farm animals. But in the need to feed farm animals. But in the wild, salmon are carnivores. So for wild, salmon are carnivores. So for wild, salmon are carnivores. So for farm-raised salmon, this soybased diet farm-raised salmon, this soybased diet farm-raised salmon, this soybased diet is supplemented by feeding them other is supplemented by feeding them other is supplemented by feeding them other fish. There are some fish that are fish. There are some fish that are fish. There are some fish that are salmon that are raised without any fish salmon that are raised without any fish salmon that are raised without any fish meal and fish oil, [music] but um I meal and fish oil, [music] but um I meal and fish oil, [music] but um I think most farm salmon use fish meal and think most farm salmon use fish meal and think most farm salmon use fish meal and fish oil to some extent. Some of this fish oil to some extent. Some of this fish oil to some extent. Some of this fish meal does come from fish byproduct fish meal does come from fish byproduct fish meal does come from fish byproduct and scraps from other fish that have and scraps from other fish that have and scraps from other fish that have been processed to be eaten, but most of been processed to be eaten, but most of been processed to be eaten, but most of it comes from wild caught fish that are it comes from wild caught fish that are it comes from wild caught fish that are being caught just to feed the [music] being caught just to feed the [music] being caught just to feed the [music] salmon. So, the effects of salmon on the salmon. So, the effects of salmon on the salmon. So, the effects of salmon on the environment ripple out far beyond the environment ripple out far beyond the environment ripple out far beyond the farms themselves [music] to the soy farms themselves [music] to the soy farms themselves [music] to the soy farms and fisheries that feed them. But farms and fisheries that feed them. But farms and fisheries that feed them. But even still, Professor Hillbornne argues even still, Professor Hillbornne argues even still, Professor Hillbornne argues that farming salmon is more sustainable that farming salmon is more sustainable that farming salmon is more sustainable than farming other land animals. than farming other land animals. than farming other land animals. &gt;&gt; So, it takes less feed to make a pound &gt;&gt; So, it takes less feed to make a pound &gt;&gt; So, it takes less feed to make a pound of salmon than it takes to produce a of salmon than it takes to produce a of salmon than it takes to produce a pound of chicken.

When you zoom out, salmon aquaculture looks you zoom out, salmon aquaculture looks you zoom out, salmon aquaculture looks like a better alternative to land-based like a better alternative to land-based like a better alternative to land-based farming and even wildcaugh salmon.

What is salmon farming like for the salmon salmon farming like for the salmon salmon farming like for the salmon themselves? themselves? themselves? &gt;&gt; So, uh, in salmon farming, there are &gt;&gt; So, uh, in salmon farming, there are &gt;&gt; So, uh, in salmon farming, there are many things that are done to the animals many things that are done to the animals many things that are done to the animals that are invasive.
