[{"id": "yt_95ovIJ3dsNk", "userId": "system_native", "title": "How childhood trauma affects health across a lifetime | Nadine Burke Harris | TED", "language": "en", "content": "In the mid-'90s, the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United States. In high doses, it affects brain development, the immune system, hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a 20-year difference in life expectancy. And yet, doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment. Now, the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical. It's childhood trauma. Okay. What kind of trauma am I talking about here? I'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game. I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology: things like abuse or neglect, or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence. Now, for a long time, I viewed these things in the way I was trained to view them, either as a social problem -- refer to social services -- or as a mental health problem -- refer to mental health services. And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach. When I finished my residency, I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed, someplace where I could make a difference. So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center, one of the best private hospitals in Northern California, and together, we opened a clinic in Bayview-Hunters Point, one of the poorest, most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco. Now, prior to that point, there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than 10,000 children, so we hung a shingle, and we were able to provide top-quality care regardless of ability to pay. It was so cool. We targeted the typical health disparities: access to care, immunization rates, asthma hospitalization rates, and we hit all of our numbers. We felt very proud of ourselves. But then I started noticing a disturbing trend. A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but when I actually did a thorough history and physical, what I found was that for most of my patients, I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD. Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on. Somehow I was missing something important. Now, before I did my residency, I did a master's degree in public health, and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well, and 98 of them develop diarrhea, you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics, or you can walk over and say, \"What the hell is in this well?\" So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. And then one day, my colleague walked into my office, and he said, \"Dr. Burke, have you seen this?\" In his hand was a copy of a research study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study. That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about. It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC, and together, they asked 17,500 adults about their history of exposure to what they called \"adverse childhood experiences,\" or ACEs. Those include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; physical or emotional neglect; parental mental illness, substance dependence, incarceration; parental separation or divorce; or domestic violence. For every yes, you would get a point on your ACE score. And then what they did was they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes. What they found was striking. Two things: Number one, ACEs are incredibly common. Sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ACE, and 12.6 percent, one in eight, had four or more ACEs. The second thing that they found was that there was a dose-response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes: the higher your ACE score, the worse your health outcomes. For a person with an ACE score of four or more, their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero. For hepatitis, it was also two and a half times. For depression, it was four and a half times. For suicidality, it was 12 times. A person with an ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease, the number one killer in the United States of America. Well, of course this makes sense. Some people looked at this data and they said, \"Come on. You have a rough childhood, you're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health. This isn't science. This is just bad behavior.\" It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in. We now understand better than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens, the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence. It inhibits the prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for impulse control and executive function, a critical area for learning. And on MRI scans, we see measurable differences in the amygdala, the brain's fear response center. So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high-risk behavior, and that's important to know. But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior, you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer. The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight-or-flight response. How does it work? Well, imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear. Immediately, your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary, which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says, \"Release stress hormones! Adrenaline! Cortisol!\" And so your heart starts to pound, Your pupils dilate, your airways open up, and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear. And that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear. (Laughter) But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night, and this system is activated over and over and over again, and it goes from being adaptive, or life-saving, to maladaptive, or health-damaging. Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation, because their brains and bodies are just developing. High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function, they affect the developing immune system, developing hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. So for me, this information threw my old training out the window, because when we understand the mechanism of a disease, when we know not only which pathways are disrupted, but how, then as doctors, it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment. That's what we do. So in San Francisco, we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent, screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress. We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical, because I know that if my patient has an ACE score of 4, she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD, she's four and half times as likely to become depressed, and she's 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs. I know that when she's in my exam room. For our patients who do screen positive, we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices, including home visits, care coordination, mental health care, nutrition, holistic interventions, and yes, medication when necessary. But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets, or lead poisoning, and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment, given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems. So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops, because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview. I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this, it would be routine screening, multi-disciplinary treatment teams, and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols. Yeah. That did not happen. And that was a huge learning for me. What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement. In the words of Dr. Robert Block, the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, \"Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.\" And for a lot of people, that's a terrifying prospect. The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it. But for me, that's actually where the hopes lies, because when we have the right framework, when we recognize this to be a public health crisis, then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions. From tobacco to lead poisoning to HIV/AIDS, the United States actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems, but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment, and when I look at what our nation's response has been so far, I wonder, why haven't we taken this more seriously? You know, at first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us. That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods. Which is weird, because the data doesn't bear that out. The original ACEs study was done in a population that was 70 percent Caucasian, 70 percent college-educated. But then, the more I talked to folks, I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards. If I were to ask how many people in this room grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness, I bet a few hands would go up. And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much, or who really believed that if you spare the rod, you spoil the child, I bet a few more hands would go up. Even in this room, this is an issue that touches many of us, and I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us. Maybe it's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it. We'd rather be sick. Fortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities make that option less viable every day. The science is clear: Early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime. Today, we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death, and 30 years from now, the child who has a high ACE score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized, whose asthma management is not connected, and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS. People will look at that situation and say, \"What the heck happened there?\" This is treatable. This is beatable. The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say, this is real and this is all of us. I believe that we are the movement. Thank you.

not be the same | Lara Boyd | TEDxVancouver", "language": "en", "content": "Translator: Jessica Lee Reviewer: Denise RQ So how do we learn? And why does some of us learn things more easily than others? So, as I just mentioned, I'm Dr. Lara Boyd. I am a brain researcher here at the University of British Columbia. These are the questions that fascinate me. (Cheers) (Applause) So brain research is one of the great frontiers in the understanding of human physiology, and also in the consideration of what makes us who we are. It's an amazing time to be a brain researcher, and I would argue to you that I have the most interesting job in the world. What we know about the brain is changing at a breathtaking pace. And much of what we thought we knew and understood about the brain turns out to be not true or incomplete. Some of these misconceptions are more obvious than others. For example, we used to think that after childhood the brain did not, really could not change. And it turns out that nothing could be farther from the truth. Another misconception about the brain is that you only use parts of it at any given time and it's silent when you do nothing. Well, this is also untrue. It turns out that even when you're at a rest and thinking of nothing, your brain is highly active. So it's been advances in technology, such as MRI, that's allowed us to make these and many other important discoveries. And perhaps the most exciting, the most interesting and transformative of these discoveries is that, every time you learn a new fact or skill, you change your brain. It's something we call neuroplasticity. So as little as 25 years ago, we thought that after about puberty, the only changes that took place in the brain were negative: the loss of brain cells with aging, the result of damage, like a stroke. And then, studies began to show remarkable amounts of reorganization in the adult brain. And the ensuing research has shown us that all of our behaviors change our brain. That these changes are not limited by age, it's a good news right? And in fact, they are taking place all the time. And very importantly, brain reorganization helps to support recovery after you damage your brain. The key to each of these changes is neuroplasticity. So what does it look like? So your brain can change in three very basic ways to support learning. And the first is chemical. So your brain actually functions by transferring chemicals signals between brain cells, what we call neurons, and this triggered a series of actions and reactions. So to support learning, your brain can increase the amount or the concentrations of these chemical signaling that's taking place between neurons. Because this change can happen rapidly, this supports short-term memory or the short-term improvement in the performance of a motor skill. The second way that the brain can change to support learning is by altering its structure. So during learning, the brain can change the connections between neurons. Here, the physical structure of the brain is actually changing so this takes a bit more time. These type of changes are related to long-term memory, the long-term improvement in a motor skill. These processes interact, and let me give you an example of how. We've all tried to learn a new motor skill, maybe playing the piano, maybe learning to juggle. You've had the experience of getting better and better within a single session of practice, and thinking \"I have got it.\" And then, maybe you return the next day, and all those improvements from the day before are lost. What happened? Well, in the short-term, your brain was able to increase the chemical signaling between your neurons. But for some reason, those changes did not induce the structural changes that are necessary to support long-term memory. Remember that long-term memories take time. And what you see in the short term does not reflect learning, It's these physical changes that are now going to support long-term memories, and chemical changes that support short-term memories. Structural changes also can lead to integrated networks of brain regions that function together to support learning. And they can also lead to certain brain regions that are important for very specific behaviors to change your structure or to enlarge. So here's some examples of that. People who read Braille have larger hand sensory areas in their brain than those of us who don't. Your dominant hand motor region, which is on the left side of your brain, if you are right-handed, is larger than the other side. And research shows the London taxi cab drivers who actually have to memorize a map of London to get their taxi cab license, they have larger brain regions devoted to spatial, or mapping memories. The last way that your brain can change to support learning is by altering its function. As you use a brain region, It becomes more and more excitable and easy to use again. And as your brain has these areas that increase their excitability, the brain shifts how and when they are activated. With learning, we see that whole networks of brain activity are shifting and changing. So neuroplasticity is supported by chemical, by structural, and by functional changes, and these are happening across the whole brain. They can occur in isolation from one or another, but most often, they take place in concert. Together, they support learning. And they're taking place all the time. I just told you really how awesomely neuroplastic your brain is. Why can't you learn anything you choose to with ease? Why do our kids sometimes fail in school? Why as we age do we tend to forget things? And why don't people fully recover from brain damage? That is: what is it that limits and facilitates neuroplasticity? And so this is what I study. I study specifically how it relates to recovery from stroke. Recently, stroke dropped from being the third leading cause of death in the United States to be the forth leading cause of death. Great news, right? But actually, it turns out that the number of people having a stroke has not declined. We are just better at keeping people alive after a severe stroke. It turns out to be very difficult to help the brain recover from stroke. And frankly, we have failed to develop effective rehabilitation interventions. The net result of this is that stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in adults in the world; individuals with stroke are younger and tending to live longer with that disability, and research from my group actually shows that the health-related quality of life of Canadians with stroke has declined. So clearly we need to be better at helping people recover from stroke. This is an enormous societal problem, and it's one that we are not solving. So what can be done? One thing is absolutely clear: the best driver of neuroplastic change in your brain is your behavior. The problem is that the dose of behavior, the dose of practice that's required to learn new and relearn old motor skills, is very large. And how to effectively deliver these large doses of practice is a very difficult problem; It's also a very expensive problem. So the approach that my research has taken is to develop therapies that prime or that prepare the brain to learn. And these have included brain simulation, exercise, and robotics. But through my research, I've realized that a major limitation to the development of therapies that speed recovery from stroke is that patterns of neuroplasticity are highly variable from person to person. As a researcher, variability used to drive me crazy. It makes it very difficult to use the statistics to test your data and your ideas. And because of this, medical intervention studies are specifically designed to minimize variability. But in my research, it's becoming really clear that the most important, the most informative data we collect is showing this variability. So by studying the brain after stroke, we've learned a lot, and I think these lessons are very valuable in other areas. The first lesson is that the primary driver of change in your brain is your behavior, so there is no neuroplasticity drug you can take. Nothing is more effective than practice at helping you learn, and the bottom line is you have to do the work. And in fact, my research has shown increased difficulty, increased struggle if you will, during practice, actually leads to both more learning, and greater structural change in the brain. The problem here is that neuroplastcity can work both ways. It can be positive, you learn something new, and you refine a motor skill. And it also can be negative though, you forgot something you once knew, you become addicted to drugs, maybe you have chronic pain. So your brain is tremendously plastic, and it's been shaped both structurally and functionally by everything you do, but also by everything that you don't do. The second lesson we've learned about the brain is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to learning. So there is no recipe for learning. Consider the popular belief that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to learn and to master a new motor skill. I can assure you it's not quite that simple. For some of us, it's going to take a lot more practice, and for others it may take far less. So the shaping of our plastic brains is far too unique for there to be any single intervention that's going to work for all of us. This realization has forced us to consider something call personalized medicine. This is the idea that to optimize outcomes each individual requires their own intervention. And the idea actually comes from cancer treatments. And here it turns out that genetics are very important in matching certain types of chemotherapy with specific forms of cancer. My research is showing that this also applies to recovery from stroke. There're certain characteristics of brain structure and function we called biomarkers. And these biomarkers are proving to be very helpful and helping us to match specific therapies with individual patients. The data from my lab suggests it's a combination of biomarkers that best predicts neuroplastic change and patterns of recovery after stroke. And that's not surprising, given how complicated the human brain is. But I also think we can consider this concept much more broadly. Given the unique structure and function of each of our brains what we've learned about neuroplasticity after stroke applies to everyone. Behaviors that you employ in your everyday life are important. Each of them is changing your brain. And I believe we have to consider not just personalized medicine but personalized learning. The uniqueness of your brain will affect you both as a learner and also as a teacher. This idea helps us to understand why some children can thrive in tradition education settings and others don't; why some of us can learn languages easily and yet, others can pick up any sport and excel. So when you leave this room today, your brain will not be the same as when you entered this morning. And I think that's pretty amazing. But each of you is going to have changed your brain differently. Understanding these differences, these individual patterns, this variability and change is going to enable the next great advance in neuroscience; it's going to allow us to develop new and more effective interventions, and allow for matches between learners and teachers, and patients and interventions. And this does not just apply the recovery from stroke, it applies to each of us, as a parent, as a teacher, as a manager, and also because you are at TEDx today, as a lifelong learner. Study how and what you learn best. Repeat those behaviors that are healthy for your brain, and break those behaviors and habits that are not. Practice. Learning is about doing the work that your brain requires. So the best strategies are going to vary between individuals. You know what, they're even going to vary within individuals. So for you, learning music may come very easily, but learning to snowboard, much harder. I hope that you leave today with a new appreciation of how magnificent your brain is. You and your plastic brain are constantly being shaped by the world around you. Understand that everything you do, everything you encounter, and everything you experience is changing your brain. And that can be for better, but it can also be for worse. So when you leave today, go out and build the brain you want. Thank you very much.

"language": "en", "content": "One of my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to. And I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why, but as I got older, I realized we had drug addiction in my family, including later cocaine addiction. I'd been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain, and we then imposed that on the rest of the world. It's a century since we made this really fateful decision to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer, because we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop. And a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them. And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction? Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working, and is there a better way out there that we could try instead? So I read loads of stuff about it, and I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for, so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and see if I could learn from them. And I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people, from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them -- it turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances -- to the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal. And the thing I realized that really blew my mind is, almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong, and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction, I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies. But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew. Let's think about this middle row here. Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day. Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect. (Laughter) Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment. Imagine you did that, right? What would happen? Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century. We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right? That's what I thought. First thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me. If I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine. Diamorphine is heroin. It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated. Actually, very little of it is heroin, whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure. And you'll be given it for quite a long period of time. There are loads of people in this room, you may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin. And anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening. And if what we believe about addiction is right -- those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks -- What should happen? They should become addicts. This has been studied really carefully. It doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn't come out as a junkie. (Laughter) And when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander. He's a professor of psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment I think really helps us to understand this issue. Professor Alexander explained to me, the idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story, comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century. They're really simple. You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic. You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly. So there you go, right? That's how we think it works. In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something. He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage. It's got nothing to do except use these drugs. Let's try something different. So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called \"Rat Park,\" which is basically heaven for rats. They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls, they've got loads of tunnels. Crucially, they've got loads of friends. They can have loads of sex. And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water. But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water. They almost never use it. None of them ever use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives. Now, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought, maybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us. Maybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know -- But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time. It was called the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin, and if you look at the news reports from the time, they were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States when the war ends; it made total sense. Now, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home. The Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study, and what happened to them? It turns out they didn't go to rehab. They didn't go into withdrawal. Ninety-five percent of them just stopped. Now, if you believe the story about chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction. He said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks? What if addiction is about your cage? What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment? Looking at this, there was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction. Maybe we should call it bonding. Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other, but if you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief. Now, that might be gambling, that might be pornography, that might be cocaine, that might be cannabis, but you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature. That's what we want as human beings. And at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around, but one way that helped me to think about it is, I can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right? I'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you. Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war. Totally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right? We could all be getting drunk -- I might after this -- (Laughter) -- but we're not. Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months. You wouldn't end up homeless. You're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that is not because anyone's stopping you. It's because you've got bonds and connections that you want to be present for. You've got work you love. You've got people you love. You've got healthy relationships. And a core part of addiction, I came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests, is about not being able to bear to be present in your life. Now, this has really significant implications. The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs. In Arizona, I went out with a group of women who were made to wear t-shirts saying, \"I was a drug addict,\" and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them, and when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records that mean they'll never work in the legal economy again. Now, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang, but actually almost everywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that. We punish them. We shame them. We give them criminal records. We put barriers between them reconnecting. There was a doctor in Canada, Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system. Now, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite, and I went there to see how it worked. In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe. One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing, and every year, they tried the American way more and more. They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse. And one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together, and basically said, look, we can't go on with a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts. Let's set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem. And they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão, to look at all this new evidence, and they came back and they said, \"Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but\" -- and this is the crucial next step -- \"take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off, on disconnecting them, and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society.\" And that's not really what we think of as drug treatment in the United States and Britain. So they do do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy, that does have some value. But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do: a massive program of job creation for addicts, and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses. So say you used to be a mechanic. When you're ready, they'll go to a garage, and they'll say, if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages. The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning. And when I went and met the addicts in Portugal, what they said is, as they rediscovered purpose, they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society. It'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began, and the results are in: injecting drug use is down in Portugal, according to the British Journal of Criminology, by 50 percent, five-zero percent. Overdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts. Addiction in every study is significantly down. One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system. Now, that's the political implications. I actually think there's a layer of implications to all this research below that. We live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating. Before these talks began -- you guys know this -- we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on, and I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours. (Laughter) A lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say, I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction and weird to say it's growing, because you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely. But I increasingly began to think that the connections we have or think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection. If you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something. It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you. It won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round. It'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced and textured, face-to-face relationships with, and there's a study I learned about from Bill McKibben, the environmental writer, that I think tells us a lot about this. It looked at the number of close friends the average American believes they can call on in a crisis. That number has been declining steadily since the 1950s. The amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing, and I think that's like a metaphor for the choice we've made as a culture. We've traded floorspace for friends, we've traded stuff for connections, and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been. And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says, we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery, and it's right to talk about that, but we need to talk much more about social recovery. Something's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group, and we've created a society where, for a lot of us, life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park. If I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it. I didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff. I wanted to know how to help the people I love. And when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this, I looked at the addicts in my life, and if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict, and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room. You are angry a lot of the time, and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us, right? Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you. And the kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by, I think, the reality show \"Intervention,\" if you guys have ever seen it. I think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV, but that's another TED Talk. If you've ever seen the show \"Intervention,\" it's a pretty simple premise. Get an addict, all the people in their life, gather them together, confront them with what they're doing, and they say, if you don't shape up, we're going to cut you off. So what they do is they take the connection to the addict, and they threaten it, they make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want. And I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work, and I began to think that's almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War into our private lives. So I was thinking, how could I be Portuguese? And what I've tried to do now, and I can't tell you I do it consistently and I can't tell you it's easy, is to say to the addicts in my life that I want to deepen the connection with them, to say to them, I love you whether you're using or you're not. I love you, whatever state you're in, and if you need me, I'll come and sit with you because I love you and I don't want you to be alone or to feel alone. And I think the core of that message -- you're not alone, we love you -- has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually. For 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts. I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them, because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection. Thank you.

Walker | TED", "language": "en", "content": "Thank you very much. Well, I would like to start with testicles. (Laughter) Men who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more. (Laughter) In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior. So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade in terms of that critical aspect of wellness. And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep. This is the best news that I have for you today. (Laughter) From this point, it may only get worse. Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough, both for your brain and for your body. Let me start with the brain and the functions of learning and memory, because what we've discovered over the past 10 or so years is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the save button on those new memories so that you don't forget. But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain, almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up new information. And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain essentially become waterlogged, as it were, and you can't absorb new memories. So let me show you the data. Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea. So we took a group of individuals and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups: a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group. Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber, but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake in the laboratory, under full supervision. There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved. And then the next day, we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts as we're taking snapshots of brain activity. And then we're going to test them to see how effective that learning has been. And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis. And when you put those two groups head to head, what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep. I think this should be concerning, considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now. In fact, to put that in context, it would be the difference in a child acing an exam versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent. And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain to produce these types of learning disabilities. And there's a structure that sits on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus. And you can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational inbox of your brain. It's very good at receiving new memory files and then holding on to them. And when you look at this structure in those people who'd had a full night of sleep, we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity. Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived, we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever. So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox, and any new incoming files -- they were just being bounced. You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory. So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you, but let me just come back to that control group for a second. Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep? Well, we can ask a very different question: What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep when you do get it that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability each and every day? And by placing electrodes all over the head, what we've discovered is that there are big, powerful brainwaves that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep that have riding on top of them these spectacular bursts of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles. And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night, shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain, and therefore protecting them, making them safe. And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits, because there are real medical and societal implications. And let me just tell you about one area that we've moved this work out into, clinically, which is the context of aging and dementia. Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older, our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline. But what we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing. And only last year, we finally published evidence that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring, they are significantly interrelated. And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep is an underappreciated factor that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline in aging, and most recently we've discovered, in Alzheimer's disease as well. Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news. It's in the mail. It's coming at you. But there's a potential silver lining here. Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging, for example changes in the physical structure of the brain, that's fiendishly difficult to treat. But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting because we may be able to do something about it. And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center is not by using sleeping pills, by the way. Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep. Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this. It's called direct current brain stimulation. You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain, so small you typically don't feel it, but it has a measurable impact. Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young, healthy adults, as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep-sleep brainwaves, not only can you amplify the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves, but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit that you get from sleep. The question now is whether we can translate this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology into older adults and those with dementia. Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep, and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning and memory function? That is my real hope now. That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were. So that's an example of sleep for your brain, but sleep is just as essential for your body. We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system. Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system, and that all it takes is one hour. Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight saving time. Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day. In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep, we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks. Isn't that incredible? And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates. But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this: sleep loss and your immune system. And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image. They are called natural killer cells, and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents of your immune system. They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements and eliminating them. In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass. So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times, and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough. So here in this experiment, you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night, you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours for one single night, and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer. And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent, it's not 20 percent. There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity. That's a concerning state of immune deficiency, and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding significant links between short sleep duration and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer. Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast. In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen, because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms. So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead. Well, I'm being quite serious now -- it is mortally unwise advice. We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals. There's a simple truth: the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality. And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer or even Alzheimer's disease were not sufficiently disquieting, we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA genetic code. So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night for one week, and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night. And there were two critical findings. First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity, caused by a lack of sleep. The second result was that about half of those genes were actually increased in their activity. The other half were decreased. Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with your immune system, so once again, you can see that immune deficiency. In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep, were genes associated with the promotion of tumors, genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body, and genes associated with stress, and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease. There is simply no aspect of your wellness that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed. It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home. Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology, even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out your daily health narrative. And at this point, you may be thinking, \"Oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep? What are you tips for good sleep?\" Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep, and if you're struggling with sleep at night, avoiding naps during the day, I have two pieces of advice for you. The first is regularity. Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time, no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend. Regularity is king, and it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep. The second is keep it cool. Your body needs to drop its core temperature by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep, and it's the reason you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees, or about 18 degrees Celsius. That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people. And then finally, in taking a step back, then, what is the mission-critical statement here? Well, I think it may be this: sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury. Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity. It is your life-support system, and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality. And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness, even the safety and the education of our children. It's a silent sleep loss epidemic, and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges that we face in the 21st century. I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep, and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laziness. And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life, the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were. And with that soapbox rant over, I will simply say, good night, good luck, and above all ... I do hope you sleep well. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. David Biello: No, no, no. Stay there for a second. Good job not running away, though. I appreciate that. So that was terrifying. Matt Walker: You're welcome. DB: Yes, thank you, thank you. Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do? What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else? MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep. Sleep is not like the bank. You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time. I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic and that our health deteriorates so quickly, first, it's because human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason. DB: Because we're smart. MW: And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature, throughout the course of evolution, has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation. So she's never developed a safety net, and that's why when you undersleep, things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body. So you just have to prioritize. DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed, what do I do? MW: So if you are staying in bed awake for too long, you should get out of bed and go to a different room and do something different. The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness, and you need to break that association. So only return to bed when you are sleepy, and that way you will relearn the association that you once had, which is your bed is the place of sleep. So the analogy would be, you'd never sit at the dinner table, waiting to get hungry, so why would you lie in bed, waiting to get sleepy? DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call. Great job, Matt.

discovered over the past 10 or so years is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the save button on those new memories so that you don't forget.", "But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain, almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up new information.", "And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain essentially become waterlogged, as it were, and you can't absorb new memories.", "So let me show you the data.", "Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea.", "So we took a group of individuals and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups: a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group.", "Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber, but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake in the laboratory, under full supervision.", "There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved.", "And then the next day, we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts as we're taking snapshots of brain activity.", "And then we're going to test them to see how effective that learning has been.", "And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis.", "And when you put those two groups head to head, what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep.", "I think this should be concerning, considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now.", "In fact, to put that in context, it would be the difference in a child acing an exam versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.", "And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain to produce these types of learning disabilities.", "And there's a structure that sits on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus.", "And you can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational inbox of your brain.", "It's very good at receiving new memory files and then holding on to them.", "And when you look at this structure in those people who'd had a full night of sleep, we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity.", "Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived, we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.", "So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox, and any new incoming files -- they were just being bounced.", "You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory.", "So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you, but let me just come back to that control group for a second.", "Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep?", "Well, we can ask a very different question: What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep when you do get it that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability each and every day?", "And by placing electrodes all over the head, what we've discovered is that there are big, powerful brainwaves that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep that have riding on top of them these spectacular bursts of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles.", "And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night, shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain, and therefore protecting them, making them safe.", "And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits, because there are real medical and societal implications.", "And let me just tell you about one area that we've moved this work out into, clinically, which is the context of aging and dementia.", "Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older, our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline.", "But what we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing.", "And only last year, we finally published evidence that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring, they are significantly interrelated.", "And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep is an underappreciated factor that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline in aging, and most recently we've discovered, in Alzheimer's disease as well.", "Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news.", "It's in the mail.", "It's coming at you.", "But there's a potential silver lining here.", "Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging, for example changes in the physical structure of the brain, that's fiendishly difficult to treat.", "But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting because we may be able to do something about it.", "And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center is not by using sleeping pills, by the way.", "Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep.", "Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this.", "It's called direct current brain stimulation.", "You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain, so small you typically don't feel it, but it has a measurable impact.", "Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young, healthy adults, as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep-sleep brainwaves, not only can you amplify the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves, but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit that you get from sleep.", "The question now is whether we can translate this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology into older adults and those with dementia.", "Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep, and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning and memory function?", "That is my real hope now.", "That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were.", "So that's an example of sleep for your brain, but sleep is just as essential for your body.", "We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system.", "Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system, and that all it takes is one hour.", "Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight saving time.", "Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day.", "In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep, we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks.", "Isn't that incredible?", "And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates.", "But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this: sleep loss and your immune system.", "And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image.", "They are called natural killer cells, and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents of your immune system.", "They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements and eliminating them.", "In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.", "So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times, and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough.", "So here in this experiment, you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night, you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours for one single night, and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer.", "And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent, it's not 20 percent.", "There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity.", "That's a concerning state of immune deficiency, and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding significant links between short sleep duration and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer.", "Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast.", "In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen, because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms.", "So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead.", "Well, I'm being quite serious now -- it is mortally unwise advice.", "We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals.", "There's a simple truth: the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.", "Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.", "And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer or even Alzheimer's disease were not sufficiently disquieting, we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA genetic code.", "So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night for one week, and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night.", "And there were two critical findings.", "First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity, caused by a lack of sleep.", "The second result was that about half of those genes were actually increased in their activity.", "The other half were decreased.", "Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with your immune system, so once again, you can see that immune deficiency.", "In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep, were genes associated with the promotion of tumors, genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body, and genes associated with stress, and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.", "There is simply no aspect of your wellness that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed.", "It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home.", "Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology, even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out your daily health narrative.", "And at this point, you may be thinking, \"Oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep?", "What are you tips for good sleep?\" Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep, and if you're struggling with sleep at night, avoiding naps during the day, I have two pieces of advice for you.", "The first is regularity.", "Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time, no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend.", "Regularity is king, and it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep.", "The second is keep it cool.", "Your body needs to drop its core temperature by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep, and it's the reason you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot.", "So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees, or about 18 degrees Celsius.", "That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people.", "And then finally, in taking a step back, then, what is the mission-critical statement here?", "Well, I think it may be this: sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury.", "Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity.", "It is your life-support system, and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality.", "And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness, even the safety and the education of our children.", "It's a silent sleep loss epidemic, and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges that we face in the 21st century.", "I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep, and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laziness.", "And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life, the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were.", "And with that soapbox rant over, I will simply say, good night, good luck, and above all ...", "I do hope you sleep well.", "Thank you very much indeed.", "(Applause) Thank you.", "(Applause) Thank you so much.", "David Biello: No, no, no.", "Stay there for a second.", "Good job not running away, though.", "I appreciate that.", "So that was terrifying.", "Matt Walker: You're welcome.", "DB: Yes, thank you, thank you.", "Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do?", "What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else?", "MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep.", "Sleep is not like the bank.", "You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time.", "I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic and that our health deteriorates so quickly, first, it's because human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason.", "DB: Because we're smart.", "MW: And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature, throughout the course of evolution, has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation.", "So she's never developed a safety net, and that's why when you undersleep, things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body.", "So you just have to prioritize.", "DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed, what do I do?", "MW: So if you are staying in bed awake for too long, you should get out of bed and go to a different room and do something different.", "The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness, and you need to break that association.", "So only return to bed when you are sleepy, and that way you will relearn the association that you once had, which is your bed is the place of sleep.", "So the analogy would be, you'd never sit at the dinner table, waiting to get hungry, so why would you lie in bed, waiting to get sleepy?", "DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call.", "Great job, Matt.",

This is iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Air. Definitely get subscribed to be among the first to see the full reviews when they come out. But this is my first impressions. And I actually found it pretty simple to synthesize my thoughts on everything they announced today. Like there is some good tech, there's some interesting new designs, and some questionable decisions. But the funny thing is, you know, as I go to these events, and as I think about all of this stuff, what usually happens is I end up typically getting some texts from friends asking what I think of the announcements. And my mental task is to summarize everything I'm thinking about into one or two easily-digestible sentences, or just words, to understand what's new and what happened. I don't wanna tell them too much information. And so that's what I'm gonna give you about each of the things Apple announced today. I'm gonna give you my super, super compressed version of what I saw. So let's just start with the iPhone 17, right? The base new iPhones. My ultra-simple summary for the iPhone 17 would be, hey, it got ProMotion and a better selfie camera, and the rest is mostly the same. So the design is mostly unchanged, other than the new colors. Same screen sizes, same dimensions, same camera bump, same buttons, and camera control, which they barely talked about. But there's a new A19 chip inside, which we expected. That should see some nice performance gains and efficiency bumps. Roughly 20% faster CPU, which is nice. And battery life should be a few beats longer. And the display is brighter too, getting up to 3,000 nits. But this is the first time we are seeing a Pro-branded feature on a non-Pro iPhone, because every new iPhone across the range now has ProMotion. And it's the same ProMotion too. It's the adaptive 1 to 120 hertz. Doesn't seem to be handicapped at all. It's funny, we always used to have that \"Oh, regular people don't care about 120 hertz\" argument. But now here it is on the new base iPhones, so hey, sounds great to me. This makes the base iPhones much more usable, and so does the new base storage of 256 gigs. So those are welcome upgrades. But the other new thing was the selfie camera. And it was funny, the keynote was pretty chill, up until the point where they started to talk about this, and it was actually the loudest applause, and it was really tempting to make fun of it. But I actually do think this was really clever, because all these new iPhones have this massively-upgraded selfie camera system. They're calling it Center Stage, but I actually think that kind of does a disservice, because the actual Center Stage on their laptops and stuff is kind of annoying. But what's happening is with these phones, they all have a larger 24-megapixel square selfie camera sensor. And so then when you go to take a selfie, the phone can take a regular vertical selfie, or can manually, or even automatically, take a horizontal selfie without you having to rotate the phone. And honestly, this might be genius. Like the default for most people is obviously to take a vertical selfie now. It just fits on the phone. You're probably viewing it on the phone. But if you go to take a horizontal selfie to fit more people, suddenly the camera lens is off to the side, and it's a little bit less natural-looking. So now since the selfie camera is larger, and a square, it can literally just crop an 18-megapixel selfie in portrait or landscape. And for videos or photos. I think it's great, it's very useful. It might be the biggest upgrade to the iPhone 17. So then there's the iPhone 17 Pro. And my quick, friendly summary of the Pro phones is, hey, they got better zoom, and more battery, and orange. So the Pro iPhones actually look a little bit different. There's actually quite a bit going on here with this new design. First of all, there's only three colors. Cosmic Orange, Deep Blue, and Silver. Really bumming me out that there's no black Pro phone. But then I remembered dbrand exists. Nevermind. But then the thing that's gonna catch everyone's eye on the back is the camera bar up at the top, which is what Apple keeps calling in their keynote a plateau. It kind of looks a little bit like the Pixel's visor, or frankly, what we've been seeing on a ton of other Android phones for years now. Just a huge bar across the top of the back of the phone. But it's actually not just cameras in here. Apple's done some rearranging of the insides of the phone, to actually shove more components, like the A19 Pro chip, and the logic board and storage up here in that bar, so they could fill out more of the bottom of the phone with more battery. And that approach is gonna make even more sense in a little bit. But my first reaction to that is, oh yeah, great, that sounds like these Pro phones might actually come with a real substantial battery upgrade from last year, which is, again, very welcome. Now you might also notice some other little things like the millimeter-wave antenna at the top of the phone, and the ring around that plateau actually also being an antenna. But then the other new design element is that they actually switched back to aluminum. Which is interesting, because we just saw, like, two years ago the iPhone 15 Pro's whole thing was titanium. The new titanium color and titanium rails. And it was a whole big deal. But now they're switching back to aluminum in a unibody form because it's much better thermally. And so there's also a new vapor chamber right in the middle of the back of this phone. First time we've seen a vapor chamber on the iPhone. And so this new cooling system, and new unibody aluminum build, should mean the iPhone shouldn't get nearly as hot from sustained loads to the chip. Which is different from normal, bursty, quick on-and-off workloads of everyday use. I'm talking more about like rendering long videos, or playing an intense game for a long time with ray tracing at high frame rates. This phone should be able to keep cool, and keep that performance high without overheating. Apple is saying 40% better sustained performance. So yeah, this design, it is just a little bit more than meets the eye. You know, rearranging some components here and there, being more efficient, better cooling, and better battery. The number that they quoted on stage was 39 hours of video playback, which, whatever, dumb stat, video playback. It's kind of ridiculous. But okay, we'll take that. And I also looked up the iPhone 16 Pro Max's video playback, and that was also a great battery life phone. That one quoted 33 hours. So maybe up to like 10% battery life on this phone, which is sick. And then there's the cameras that I mentioned. They always go hard with Pro phones and cameras. And this generation is no exception, with the main improvement being the new 48-megapixel 4X telephoto camera. Now 4X might be a lesser number than last year's 5X, but that was a smaller 12-megapixel sensor. This new zoom camera is a 56% larger sensor, and has way more resolution. It's 48 megapixels. So that is a smaller gap between the main camera and the zoom. And you should be able to continue to zoom further, and crop more with less consequence, now that you have 48 megapixels. The Pro phones also get the new selfie camera, they also get the new brighter display. These also got Qi2 support. And then they also got some seriously Pro features that I'm looking forward to testing, like Genlock sync support, and also ProRes RAW video, which I will hopefully be getting to test in an autofocus video coming up very soon. But of course there was one more new iPhone, the iPhone Air. No number, just Air. And you all know what that means? They're doing the ultra-thin thing, and they're leaning in hard. So this thing is a stunningly, ridiculously thin 5.6 millimeters at the thinnest part. And you can tell from the commercials, you can tell from my footage here, and, you know, the first time I hold the phone it has the same effect on me that the S25 Edge did from Samsung, which is just, it's so sick. Like clearly nobody's asking for thinner phones, but once you hold one, it is pretty impressive that they're able to make something like this. But there are also absolutely some red flags that come along with this. So the basics are, it's a 6.5-inch ProMotion display. It's got the A19 Pro chip inside. Titanium body. The new selfie camera of course is in there, and it has a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera on the back with the new design, again. Same camera as the iPhone 17, but with the nice plateau from the Pro phone. And then there's a new N1 chip inside for all the networking connectivity, which is Wi‑Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, Thread, and a new, more energy-efficient C1X modem for cellular. I put out a short that basically already said this, but I really think this phone is gonna be a hard sell, because if you subtract emotions from it, it's the worst one. This is gonna jump in the lineup at 999. It replaces essentially the Plus phones in the lineup. And it is surrounded by other iPhones that are better than it in basically every way, other than being super thin and light. So it's a fascinating gamble. This phone has the same A19 Pro chip in it as the Pro phones, minus one GPU core. Interesting choice. Apparently it's a bit more efficient than the base A19, so that's good for battery life. But we also just heard a whole long list of choices Apple made with the Pro phones to make them more thermally efficient to not overheat. Switching from titanium to aluminum, and adding a vapor chamber to the back. But this phone is still titanium, and absolutely does not have room for an advanced thermal solution, or any sort of vapor chamber. So it sounds like this phone could get much hotter, and throttle performance much quicker. It's a red flag. Now we also know that ultra-thin phones have a tendency to be a little bit less durable. They've bent over the years. And I'm not gonna be the first one to point this out. I mean, you're, I'm sure already glued to JerryRigEverything's channel for his bend test. And Apple of course has thought about this. They've for sure tested this, and they're telling us it's the most durable iPhone ever. But I mean, I'm looking at the phone, and I think it qualifies also as a red flag. And then we already know there is just no way battery life can be good on this phone, right? There's just no way. I've been reviewing phones for more than a decade, and all signs point to it being trash. There was a slide in the keynote today about how they were still proud to achieve all-day battery life. But, like come on. Really? I mean they still do the thing where they rearranged the components up into the little plateau at the top to make room for more battery at the bottom. But there's just absolutely not enough room in this phone for a large battery. And it doesn't appear to be silicon-carbon, or any sort of a special ultra-high density battery. And Apple also announced it alongside a special dedicated MagSafe battery accessory, just for this phone, that adds 3,149 mAh, and just barely, combined, will match the 17 Pro in terms of quoted video playback. So if that doesn't scream red flag, I don't know what to tell you. It is also e-SIM-only, globally, 'cause there's no room in any version of this phone for a plastic SIM card. There's also no millimeter-wave 5G. And like I said, it's coming in at $1,000, which is more expensive than the base iPhone, which will have a better camera system, and better battery life, and may overheat less. So look, I think there's two ways to look at this phone. This is either Apple just throwing something new at the wall and seeing if it sticks. Like we just saw them try, okay, they had the Mini phone for, like, two years, and that really didn't sell that well. So then they moved to the Plus, and that was also a little bit underwhelming. So now they're trying that same spot in the lineup for a ultra-thin phone, and seeing if maybe they can market that to turn into some more sales. So you can see it as that. Or you can see this as a visionary, long-time-in-the-making preview at the future of all phones. Like, maybe someday in the future every phone will be this thin. And Apple is just now, today, getting the tech together with the battery and display and modem and Apple Silicon to make this phone possible. Maybe kind of like how the first MacBook Air sucked, and was underpowered, but then eventually all laptops became that thin. Maybe that's also what's gonna happen to smartphones. And maybe the same way Samsung made the ultra-thin S25 Edge, and then a few months later they came out with their super-thin foldable, the Z Fold7, and I felt like the Edge phone was one half of that foldable. Maybe that's also what Apple's doing. Maybe we're gonna see an ultra-thin foldable iPhone next year. Maybe. Either way, I do think it's clear that you probably won't find too many logical reasons to pick up this first-gen iPhone Air. But I do also think that picking it up and holding it is gonna convince a lot of people, 'cause it's pretty stunning in person. And it's the same thing I said about the Samsung phone. It's pretty sick. But only time will tell for that part of the story. Now, there were a couple other announcements today. There were new AirPods Pro 3, which have twice as good ANC as the last gen, which is crazy. Plus IP57, and heart rate tracking during workouts. All at the same $250 price. Definitely gonna test those. And there's also a new Apple Watch Series 11, now with 5G, and possible hypertension detection. And a slightly new Watch Ultra 3 with thinner bezels, LTPO3, and slightly longer battery life. I'm gonna be testing all this stuff over the next couple weeks, so get subscribed and I'll see you in those videos. And shout out to channel sponsor Ridge for being ahead of the game, because while the iPhone Air does lack battery, it does still have MagSafe, which means you're gonna wanna pick up a Ridge Power Bank. I've seen plenty of power banks over my 15 years of reviewing tech, but this Ridge one quickly became a favorite. It's got five ways to charge, 15-watt MagSafe-compatible wireless charging, two built-in cables, USB-C up to 20 watts, and Lightning for older Apple devices. And a charging pad for your Apple Watch, pass-through charging, so it doubles as a hub, and it also comes in three colors. Matte Black, Matte Olive, and, I guess, perfect for the new iPhone 17 Pro color, Basecamp Orange. Ridge also makes a MagSafe card holder that snaps right onto your iPhone and holds up to three cards. Every Ridge product comes with a lifetime warranty, and a 99-day risk-free trial. So get one today, and head over to ridge.com/mkbhd for 10% off. Thanks for watching. See you guys very soon in the next videos. Peace.

Cooked?", "language": "en", "content": "- All right, so there are a lot of hot takes in the tech world and I see a lot of them in the comment section and in articles all the time. And one of the most common ones is, you know, have you seen these Chinese electric cars? If they ever came to the US, they would cook everything that we have here. They are too good, they have too much tech and they are too cheap to not dominate everything. And so I figured, I should get my hands on one and actually figure out if that's true or not. And yeah, you could say there's a little something to it. (uptempo music) There are so many crazy things I've learned about this car while I've been testing it but let's just start with the basics. This car here I've been driving for the last two weeks is called the Xiaomi SU7. Yeah, that Xiaomi. So the Xiaomi that makes basically everything in China, tablets, headphones, robot vacuums, printers, appliances, and smartphones. And they even refer to the trims of this car as the SU7, SU7 Pro, SU7 max, and SU7 ultra. So this here is the SU7 Max and this retails for about 299,000 Chinese yuan, which actually converts to about $42,000 US, which is gonna be a lot more impressive in about five minutes. So base specs, this is a fully electric four-door sedan, 101 kilowatt hour battery, dual motor all-wheel drive, 673 horsepower, and 320 miles a range. Already those are specs on paper on the level of like a Tesla Model 3 performance, which today costs like $55,000. Now looking around on the outside of this car, it looks like a pretty reasonable car. I think a lot of people would agree. But that's the thing, this is Xiaomi we're talking about making this car and they're not a car company, which means they don't have any previous designs that they have to pay homage to or any traditional lines and shapes that they have to keep around, which means a little bit less prestige, yes, but also a little bit more freedom because I see them taking stuff from all over the rest of the car industry in this car. Like these headlights, for example, that is very much a McLaren looking headlight and they have lotus lines on the hood here. And then as you get back, even more. Kinda looks like a Porsche Taycan from the side profile, if I'm not crazy. It has these thin bezels like the Polestar and then a thicker taillight across the back which kinda looks maybe like a Lincoln or some others. And then there's a fully active wing on the back that kinda looks like a Mercedes-AMG GT. All of these are more expensive cars for more premium brands and so they kinda meld them all together into one car with this kinda unique purple color that honestly I think looks pretty good and we're not even on the inside yet. So the inside here is where they really start to stack the winds. This is a nice car, not just in like a nice with an asterisk type of way. Like oh this is nice for a $45,000 car. Or oh this is nice for a car I've never heard of. No this, this is a nice car. It's got this pretty clean design all around the interior, again, bringing in inspiration and premium features from a bunch of different places. Like these are comfortable, heated, and ventilated leather seats. This heated steering wheel looks and feels a lot like a Porsche steering wheel to me with the shape and the simplicity and just a few buttons with stalks at the bottom. There's a big bright and automatically aligning HUD in front of me right in front of the road at all times and that's right above a small display behind the steering wheel and then a 16-inch primary display in the center. And then there's storage everywhere. There's here in the middle between the front seats where they've also cleverly stored a flashlight powered by the cars battery, kinda like Rivian. And believe it or not, a tasteful amount of real hardware controls here. There's a power on off button right here. There's temperature controls up and down, fan speed up and down at my fingertips. You can also put the wing up or down at the back of the car and there's a lift height because there is, of course, an adjustable air suspension. Up at the top there's a pair of air-cooled 50 watt wireless chargers because you know if you got a Xiaomi car you might as well have a Xiaomi phone with 50 watt wireless charging to match. So those go up there. There's also a huge tinted glass panoramic sunroof over my head. Very nice feature. The headliner is all Alcantara everywhere and there are 25 speakers in this car that sounds really good and ambient lighting everywhere that pulses to the bass of your music in the colors of the album art of the song that's playing 'cause it's connected to the car and it just knows that type of thing. And that's not even mentioning the backseat experience of this car, which is also really nice. Those screens for the rear passengers are Xiaomi tablets 'cause of course they are. I haven't even driven it yet and it's already feeling like a 60, $65,000 car. But there are not one but two really cool features I've never seen in any other car that are in this one. So, number one is the software. The software is so good. This feels like a preview kind of of like what Apple might've done if they'd made an Apple car. I say that because it's super smooth just like a smartphone but also it's a car made by someone who makes a phone. And so, the car plugs right into the Xiaomi ecosystem in so many ways. There's the wireless charger but also wireless screen mirroring. It connects to various other Xiaomi smart home accessories like security cameras. You can sign into them with the car with your account. So, everything from text messages to map directions are all syncing from your phone. And hey, if all else fails, thankfully as a backup, this car also happens to have wireless Apple CarPlay and it's nice. I think it is the biggest, nicest window of wireless CarPlay I have ever seen in a car. I think probably my favorite example of the software being incredible in this car is you see the speaker and the headrest behind me, when I'm driving and my phone is paired to the speakers in this car and I'm navigating, you know that part where like you're driving and the music's getting pretty good and right as the bass is about to drop, the navigation voice comes on and interrupts it. That never happens in this car because it separates out the voice from the navigation and puts it just in that speaker behind me while all of the rest of the music and the sound in the car stays exactly the same. So as a driver I hear the voice saying turn left, turn right, but everything else, including the music for all the passengers stays sick. That is my favorite software feature I've seen in a car in a while. So the software being awesome is the one thing, but the second awesome thing is the modules. Because this is a modular interior because hidden around this car are a bunch of various mounting points for modular accessories. There's one over here in the corner and another over here in the center all the way around the back of this center display. And so, on these mounting points you can attach various accessories that Xiaomi makes like this extra speedometer and trip display or this magnetic car mount in the corner of the car or this super useful USB hub that gets full power and can pass it along through a cable to passengers in the backseat or wherever they want. There's also high quality microphones that pair to the car for a karaoke experience, or even long range walkie-talkies for some reason if you need to maybe shoot a video with the car and communicate with the camera car. What other car does this? I've never seen the ability to customize exactly how much hardware or how little hardware you have in the interior layout like Xiaomi does. I mean they're not a car company clearly, but they've come up with some really innovative things to make the car uniquely your own. You can make it maximalist, you can make it minimalist, you can do as much or as little as you want and that'll of course fluctuate the price you pay but hey, that's up to you. I think that's pretty sick. All of that is without even mentioning all the little stuff like the active noise cancellation in here, the quality of the speakers, the surround sound, all the other things that the software does really, really well and I haven't even gotten to driving it yet. (upbeat music) So, this is obviously a standard issue, four-door electric car, right? But the superpower of electric cars is that they can have multiple personalities. That's what makes these interesting. So, in its default mode, which is comfort mode, it's pretty nice actually. It rides super soft, it's chill. The air suspension is actually pretty incredible. I feel like this is on the same level of absorbing all these bumps and all these potholes and the things on the road as the Lucids that I've driven, like this is really quite good and it never gets too unsettled. The accelerator pedal, it's responsive enough, it's not like super twitchy and aggressive. It's obviously the comfort mode so, you feel like you have the power you need but it rolls it on nicely and eases off when you remove your foot from the pedal. And what a lot of other EVs don't have is this really high degree of customization over exactly how that feels. Like there is a full on power delivery slider. You can move it to be a fully rear-wheel drive vehicle all the way to a fully front-wheel drive vehicle. And then the lift off region is nice and secure and assuring. This is a... You'd never have to take the car out of this mode if you never wanted to. This is a very reasonable thing to expect from a four-door electric car. But there's also a drive mode knob down here. If I just turn it one notch to the right, (display chimes softly) everything turns red, the graphics in front of me change. I get my estimated range and my speed and how much power I'm using. And then I rotate it again (display chimes softly) and it's sport plus mode and there's a G-Force meter now, and now all of a sudden the accelerator pedal is way more responsive and twitchy and everything firms up and the steering is definitely heavier. So this feels much more like a fun type of drive and it's not quite on the maxed out level. Like I know people wanna compare this to Porsche Taycan. This is not Porsche Taycan levels of sporty, but it's like one notch below that, which is still really good. It's got all the EV party tricks, zero to 60 in under three seconds, launch control, and even a little boost button where if you press the drive mode button, (display chimes) you get this crazy graphic on the screen and then that's all of your power, which is sick. So obviously it does great in a straight line with 600 plus horsepower, but it kinda handles on the same level of Model 3 performance or BMW i4. This is a really capable car. It's kinda like a wolf in sheep's clothes type of car where you see it on the road and it doesn't necessarily look like something that has Porsche 911 Turbo S horsepower, but it does. And so yeah, it kinda, it just gives you this confidence of being able to place the car wherever you want on the road and that is the superpower of electric cars. Plus it's got these active bolsters, the seats are hugging me when I go around turns. So when I turn right, the left bolster kinda like hugs, like catches me a little bit. This is something those very expensive G wagons have done and popularized for a while now. It's a little weird, not gonna lie, but it just makes you think it's doing something. It's also become much more apparent as I'm driving this car how well built it really is. It does not feel anything like the $42,000 price tag might suggest. Like obviously the materials are one thing and you've got these leathers all around and the stitching and these different contrasted materials, but also just in general, like it's quiet in here. I don't hear motor noise, I don't hear wind very much. I don't hear other cars or noises around me outside the car. Like I can verify that there are, there are noises out there that I'm not hearing. It's sick. And then there's the active noise cancellation on top of that. So, it just feels like a really serene calm experience just because it's so well-built. And you might have also noticed the Lidar box right above me on the top of this car here because the other button on the steering wheel is Xiaomi's full self-driving, which doesn't work on every road here in the US but in China you have Pilot Pro and Pilot Max and those will take care of almost all of the driving on almost all of the roads the same way something like a Tesla Model 3 might here in the US. So I've turned it on on this road, this is a smaller single lane road and it's totally fine and there's all sorts of things like obstacles that it has to avoid and it handles that. It's never really done anything to give me pause or seem kinda weird and it's not even designed for these roads or this market. So, I imagine in China it's even better than this. I'm honestly trying to think of like a negative. Now that I've been living with this car and I've been driving it for weeks, I've driven and reviewed many, many other cars the past couple years and usually the downsides are so obvious, like, oh, the tech is usually pretty bad, like the software is bad. But while this is Xiaomi, like they make smartphones, they make all this tech already, the software's great. The self-driving works, the cameras are great, the displays are great, all the tech is there. And then all the EV fundamentals are also still there. It has the 300 plus miles of range, it has the quick charging and it has the split personalities. It has the super chill, calm cruiser mode and the 600 horsepower brutal launch control zero to 60 in 2 1/2 seconds sporty mode. And then on top of all that it's built super well. Like it has all the sound isolation and all of the hardware features and creature comforts and physical buttons and all the modules and all this. And it's like this feels nothing like a $42,000 car, which I guess conveniently brings me back to the title of this video. (engine revs) So are we cooked? Not yet, clearly. This car is not available here in the US but you can see how we could be soon. I genuinely, I'm not exaggerating when I say this, this is a $42,000 car that feels like a $75,000 car if it were made here in the US and that's the thing that's most impressive about the Xiaomi SU7, and that's just this one. So really now that I've gotten to live with this and drive this here in the US among all the other cars I test, here's my take. It's not that there's any sort of crazy bleeding edge tech in this car that's impossible to replicate. Obviously the software is really good and the modularity and some of the features are kinda sick and we haven't seen them before. But like if you took this car apart, you wouldn't find anything inside any like bleeding edge battery tech or anything that's impossible to replicate. This is a car made of normal car parts, but it's the putting them all together in one car that's so impressive. It's not often you see a car with great software, great features, great build quality, great versatility, great range, and a great drive and all stacked together. Like, that's pretty elite. There's basically no question in my mind that if a car like this was available in the US for $42,000 that it would crush, of course. The fact that it isn't is of course inherently political and there's all the tariffs and import fees and all that, that's super variable and we may never get a car like this available in the US for $42,000, but Europe will allegedly in 2027. And I would say that the competition over there is at least in a little bit of trouble when that happens. The idea that the competition is getting stronger and that cars like this actually exists some other places in the world is really exciting and heightens the ceiling for all EVs. It raises the ceiling up for all cars to get better and more impressive and more complete like this one. So lesson learned, it's gonna be fascinating to keep an eye on this stuff in the future. If you want a more raw like daily living with this vehicle type of video, check out the Autofocus Channel where I shot a video on the Xiaomi phone of the Xiaomi car. Thanks for watching. So hey, it is of course the holiday season and in case you missed out on any of those Black Friday deals, channel partner Ridge is still running some of their biggest sales of the year with up to 47% off. So in case you missed out on some of that stuff from other brands who have shut down those sales now, we're just still going. And you know, finding the right gift is tough. You wanna get something that people actually use and not just like throw away and never see again. So, here are some ideas. First there's a new Ridge 2.0 wallets. So after 12 years of selling their wallets, they've made their biggest updates, they're 10% lighter, more modular, come with a matching plated cash strap, and future Ridge's new built for life warranty. So if you lose your wallet or it's stolen, they've got you covered. Check out the new upgraded Hyper Lime 2.0 collection. But another really nice one is Ridge has also moved into tech. So the five-in-one power bank keeps selling out and for good reason, I take this thing wherever I go. There are also 45 watt power adapter kits, the MagSafe 2.0 wallets, and the tracker card, which I keep in my bifold wallet every single day. These are the types of gifts that don't get shelved, they get used. And for people traveling this season, Ridge has the carry on and check-in luggage, which actually my team uses and I use a lot for anytime we do out of town videos. And they fit in the trunks of these cars and in the front trunks of these cars. And they're super durable and keep you protected wherever you go. So if you're still shopping for a friend or a family member or even yourself, head to ridge.com/mkbhd and continue to get up to 47% off. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next video. Peace.

common ones is, you know, have you seen these Chinese electric cars?", "If they ever came to the US, they would cook everything that we have here.", "They are too good, they have too much tech and they are too cheap to not dominate everything.", "And so I figured, I should get my hands on one and actually figure out if that's true or not.", "And yeah, you could say there's a little something to it.", "(uptempo music) There are so many crazy things I've learned about this car while I've been testing it but let's just start with the basics.", "This car here I've been driving for the last two weeks is called the Xiaomi SU7.", "Yeah, that Xiaomi.", "So the Xiaomi that makes basically everything in China, tablets, headphones, robot vacuums, printers, appliances, and smartphones.", "And they even refer to the trims of this car as the SU7, SU7 Pro, SU7 max, and SU7 ultra.", "So this here is the SU7 Max and this retails for about 299,000 Chinese yuan, which actually converts to about $42,000 US, which is gonna be a lot more impressive in about five minutes.", "So base specs, this is a fully electric four-door sedan, 101 kilowatt hour battery, dual motor all-wheel drive, 673 horsepower, and 320 miles a range.", "Already those are specs on paper on the level of like a Tesla Model 3 performance, which today costs like $55,000.", "Now looking around on the outside of this car, it looks like a pretty reasonable car.", "I think a lot of people would agree.", "But that's the thing, this is Xiaomi we're talking about making this car and they're not a car company, which means they don't have any previous designs that they have to pay homage to or any traditional lines and shapes that they have to keep around, which means a little bit less prestige, yes, but also a little bit more freedom because I see them taking stuff from all over the rest of the car industry in this car.", "Like these headlights, for example, that is very much a McLaren looking headlight and they have lotus lines on the hood here.", "And then as you get back, even more.", "Kinda looks like a Porsche Taycan from the side profile, if I'm not crazy.", "It has these thin bezels like the Polestar and then a thicker taillight across the back which kinda looks maybe like a Lincoln or some others.", "And then there's a fully active wing on the back that kinda looks like a Mercedes-AMG GT.", "All of these are more expensive cars for more premium brands and so they kinda meld them all together into one car with this kinda unique purple color that honestly I think looks pretty good and we're not even on the inside yet.", "So the inside here is where they really start to stack the winds.", "This is a nice car, not just in like a nice with an asterisk type of way.", "Like oh this is nice for a $45,000 car.", "Or oh this is nice for a car I've never heard of.", "No this, this is a nice car.", "It's got this pretty clean design all around the interior, again, bringing in inspiration and premium features from a bunch of different places.", "Like these are comfortable, heated, and ventilated leather seats.", "This heated steering wheel looks and feels a lot like a Porsche steering wheel to me with the shape and the simplicity and just a few buttons with stalks at the bottom.", "There's a big bright and automatically aligning HUD in front of me right in front of the road at all times and that's right above a small display behind the steering wheel and then a 16-inch primary display in the center.", "And then there's storage everywhere.", "There's here in the middle between the front seats where they've also cleverly stored a flashlight powered by the cars battery, kinda like Rivian.", "And believe it or not, a tasteful amount of real hardware controls here.", "There's a power on off button right here.", "There's temperature controls up and down, fan speed up and down at my fingertips.", "You can also put the wing up or down at the back of the car and there's a lift height because there is, of course, an adjustable air suspension.", "Up at the top there's a pair of air-cooled 50 watt wireless chargers because you know if you got a Xiaomi car you might as well have a Xiaomi phone with 50 watt wireless charging to match.", "So those go up there.", "There's also a huge tinted glass panoramic sunroof over my head.", "Very nice feature.", "The headliner is all Alcantara everywhere and there are 25 speakers in this car that sounds really good and ambient lighting everywhere that pulses to the bass of your music in the colors of the album art of the song that's playing 'cause it's connected to the car and it just knows that type of thing.", "And that's not even mentioning the backseat experience of this car, which is also really nice.", "Those screens for the rear passengers are Xiaomi tablets 'cause of course they are.", "I haven't even driven it yet and it's already feeling like a 60, $65,000 car.", "But there are not one but two really cool features I've never seen in any other car that are in this one.", "So, number one is the software.", "The software is so good.", "This feels like a preview kind of of like what Apple might've done if they'd made an Apple car.", "I say that because it's super smooth just like a smartphone but also it's a car made by someone who makes a phone.", "And so, the car plugs right into the Xiaomi ecosystem in so many ways.", "There's the wireless charger but also wireless screen mirroring.", "It connects to various other Xiaomi smart home accessories like security cameras.", "You can sign into them with the car with your account.", "So, everything from text messages to map directions are all syncing from your phone.", "And hey, if all else fails, thankfully as a backup, this car also happens to have wireless Apple CarPlay and it's nice.", "I think it is the biggest, nicest window of wireless CarPlay I have ever seen in a car.", "I think probably my favorite example of the software being incredible in this car is you see the speaker and the headrest behind me, when I'm driving and my phone is paired to the speakers in this car and I'm navigating, you know that part where like you're driving and the music's getting pretty good and right as the bass is about to drop, the navigation voice comes on and interrupts it.", "That never happens in this car because it separates out the voice from the navigation and puts it just in that speaker behind me while all of the rest of the music and the sound in the car stays exactly the same.", "So as a driver I hear the voice saying turn left, turn right, but everything else, including the music for all the passengers stays sick.", "That is my favorite software feature I've seen in a car in a while.", "So the software being awesome is the one thing, but the second awesome thing is the modules.", "Because this is a modular interior because hidden around this car are a bunch of various mounting points for modular accessories.", "There's one over here in the corner and another over here in the center all the way around the back of this center display.", "And so, on these mounting points you can attach various accessories that Xiaomi makes like this extra speedometer and trip display or this magnetic car mount in the corner of the car or this super useful USB hub that gets full power and can pass it along through a cable to passengers in the backseat or wherever they want.", "There's also high quality microphones that pair to the car for a karaoke experience, or even long range walkie-talkies for some reason if you need to maybe shoot a video with the car and communicate with the camera car.", "What other car does this?", "I've never seen the ability to customize exactly how much hardware or how little hardware you have in the interior layout like Xiaomi does.", "I mean they're not a car company clearly, but they've come up with some really innovative things to make the car uniquely your own.", "You can make it maximalist, you can make it minimalist, you can do as much or as little as you want and that'll of course fluctuate the price you pay but hey, that's up to you.", "I think that's pretty sick.", "All of that is without even mentioning all the little stuff like the active noise cancellation in here, the quality of the speakers, the surround sound, all the other things that the software does really, really well and I haven't even gotten to driving it yet.", "(upbeat music) So, this is obviously a standard issue, four-door electric car, right?", "But the superpower of electric cars is that they can have multiple personalities.", "That's what makes these interesting.", "So, in its default mode, which is comfort mode, it's pretty nice actually.", "It rides super soft, it's chill.", "The air suspension is actually pretty incredible.", "I feel like this is on the same level of absorbing all these bumps and all these potholes and the things on the road as the Lucids that I've driven, like this is really quite good and it never gets too unsettled.", "The accelerator pedal, it's responsive enough, it's not like super twitchy and aggressive.", "It's obviously the comfort mode so, you feel like you have the power you need but it rolls it on nicely and eases off when you remove your foot from the pedal.", "And what a lot of other EVs don't have is this really high degree of customization over exactly how that feels.", "Like there is a full on power delivery slider.", "You can move it to be a fully rear-wheel drive vehicle all the way to a fully front-wheel drive vehicle.", "And then the lift off region is nice and secure and assuring.", "This is a...", "You'd never have to take the car out of this mode if you never wanted to.", "This is a very reasonable thing to expect from a four-door electric car.", "But there's also a drive mode knob down here.", "If I just turn it one notch to the right, (display chimes softly) everything turns red, the graphics in front of me change.", "I get my estimated range and my speed and how much power I'm using.", "And then I rotate it again (display chimes softly) and it's sport plus mode and there's a G-Force meter now, and now all of a sudden the accelerator pedal is way more responsive and twitchy and everything firms up and the steering is definitely heavier.", "So this feels much more like a fun type of drive and it's not quite on the maxed out level.", "Like I know people wanna compare this to Porsche Taycan.", "This is not Porsche Taycan levels of sporty, but it's like one notch below that, which is still really good.", "It's got all the EV party tricks, zero to 60 in under three seconds, launch control, and even a little boost button where if you press the drive mode button,

[overlapping] at the movies, while working out, while doing dishes in the bath... But no matter where I'm watching I find myself constantly doing this one thing. [unintelligible] What? [unintelligible] [exhasperated sigh] [unintelligible] [exhasperated sigh] [unintelligible] Oh. It turns out this isn't unusual. We polled our YouTube audience and about 57% of people said that they feel like they can't understand the dialogue in the things that they watch unless they're using subtitles. But it feels like this hasn't always been the case. So to figure out what was going on, I made a call. Hi, my name is Austin Olivia Kendrick. I am a professional dialogue editor for film and TV. I basically perform audio surgery on actors words. Do you watch with subtitles? I– I do, actually. I do a lot of the time. So... Why do you think that we all feel like we need subtitles now? I get asked this question all the time. All the time. It's something that is... It doesn't have a simple, straightforward answer. It's very layered and very complex. And after talking to Austin for almost 2 hours, it's true. It's a very layered and complex topic. But everything kept pointing back to one main thing. Technology that got us from this... –I'll get you, my pretty. –You should be kissed and often. No, Richard, no. What has happened... To this. Mom, I just woke up. ...little slim-waisted birdy... [unintelligible] Let's start with microphones. I'm going to use this clip from \"Singin in the Rain\" to show how mics used to work. Here's the mic, you talk towards it. The sound goes through the cable to the box. A man records it on a big record in wax. This scene illustrates some of the difficulties and intricacies early sound recordings. Mics were big, bulky, temperamental and required creative solutions to be hidden. They were wired and recorded onto hard memory like wax and eventually tape. No matter how many actors were in a scene all sound got recorded to one track. So performers had to be diligently focused and facing a certain angle so that their words could be picked up. Otherwise... [muted noise, as if from far away] [sudden sound up] [muted noise, as if from far away] [sudden sound up] You couldn't hear a thing. But technology's improved to the point where microphones don't impede performance as much anymore. They become better, smaller, wireless... and we use more of them to ensure that performances get captured. What we typically are working with from production dialogue is 2 boom microphones and then every actor has at least one lavaliere microphone hidden somewhere on them. These shrinking mics have given actors the flexibility to be more naturalistic in their performances. They no longer need to project so that their words reach the mic. They can speak softly, knowing that the tiny mic hidden on their body will pick up what they're saying. And my personal favorite example of this performance shift is Alec Baldwin on 30 Rock. In a 2011 speech slash roast, Tina Fey says that \"He speaks so quietly that she can't hear him when she's standing next to him.\" \"And then you play the film back and it's there somehow.\" Just listen to this whisper off between him and Will Arnett. I'm not afraid of you. Yeah. Well, you should be. Let's just see how it all shakes out in the meeting. Naturalism isn't always the best for intelligibility, though. Take Tom Hardy, an actor that I personally love but who famously is a mumbler. ???????????? I mean... the mic picked that line up fine. Like we can definitely hear that he's talking he's saying something. But once that mumble gets recorded it's on to a dialog editor's shoulder to make it as intelligible as possible. And that was a lot harder when everything was analog. While you could pick the best takes and physically splice them together. If some piece of dialog was truly impossible to understand then actors will come in and rerecord those specific lines in a process called ADR or automated dialog replacement which you can see Meryl Streep do in this scene from \"Postcards from the Edge\". There isn't enough money in the world to further cause like yours That still gets done today, but.. ADR also costs money because you're not only paying for the actors time you're paying for the engineer's time and then the editor's time. So we try to do ADR, frankly, as little as possible. And so a lot of her job is making words sound better. The show I'm currently working on I remember in the middle of this one word there was just this loud metal clang that I couldn't remove. So I had to go in and I had to find an alternate take of it that fit and then I had to fit it... to the movement of her mouth in that moment and then push it in. And once she's done with it it's sent off to a mixer who works to make sure the frequencies of the sound effects and music don't overlap with the frequencies of the human voice something that's only possible now that the world has moved away from tape and into digital recordings. That is a big challenge. Carving out those frequencies, that space... amongst every other element of the mix for the dialogue to be able to punch through and not be all muddied up by any other sounds that exist in that band of frequencies. But even with all that work lines of dialog can still be hard to understand. The kind of feeling has been if you want your movie to feel quote unquote cinematic you have to have wall-to-wall bombastic, loud sound. A lot of people will ask like \"Why don't you just turn the dialog up?\" Like, just turn it up. And... if only it was that simple. Because a big thing that we want to preserve is a concept called dynamic range. The range between your quietest sound and your loudest sound. If you have your dialog, that's going to be at the same volume as an explosion that immediately follows it. The explosion is not going to feel as big. You need that contrast in volume in order to give your ear a sense of scale. But the thing is, you can only make something so loud before it gets distorted. So if you want to create that wide dynamic range you have no choice but to push those quieter sounds lower instead of pushing the louder sounds louder. So explosions go up and dialog comes down. Which brings us to the Christopher Nolan of it all. [loud music layered over] A seperate structure within the others— [Tom Hardy mumbling into a face mask] [rocket blasters layered over] Pushing out of orbit! Nearly every film of his has been criticized for its hard to hear dialogue that essentially begs for subtitles. But as as this headline explains, he likes it that way. According to an interview in a book called The Nolan Variations he said that he gets a lot of complaints. Even from other filmmakers who would say \"I just saw your film and the dialogue is inaudible.\" \"The truth was it was kind of the whole enchilada of how we had chosen to mix it.\" And in his 2017 interview with Indiewire, he said \"We made the decision a couple of films ago that we weren't going to mix films for substandard theaters\" And this is kind of the crux of the matter. The content that we watch here and here and here is not mixed for us, primarily. Rerecording mixers mix for the widest surround sound format that is available typically like big release films. That is Dolby Atmos.... which has true 3D sound up to 128 channels. The thing is, if you're not at a movie theater that can showcase the best sound Hollywood has to offer... you can't experience all of those channels. So after the movie is mixed for the 128 Atmos tracks somebody has to create a separate version of the film's audio where all those same sounds live on one or two or five tracks. This is called downmixing. Downmixing is the process of taking that biggest mix and folding it down into formats with lesser channels available to it. So say Atmos down to 7.1 or 7.1 down to 5.1 or 5.1 down to stereo stereo down to mono. Unlike old TVs that were gigantic and had a ton of space for speakers TVs today are super thin like this one that I have in my living room is about the same thickness as my iPhone. So even though it's outputting the same mono or stereo sound that an older TV might, it's still going to sound worse because you have to have tiny little speakers to fit into this tiny, sleek form factor. These tiny speakers are also usually on the back of the TV. So the downmixed version of this movie that went from 128 channels down to just 2 is going to sound even muddier when it's pointing away from you. And when you're watching on your phone or a laptop... it's generally not much better. When you combine not great speakers, naturalistic mumbly performances dynamic range featuring bombastic sound over dialogue and a flattened mix... It's no wonder we have trouble hearing what's going on. And it seems like the industry knows this because TVs today are shipping with all kinds of settings built in like this intelligence mode. You can put on active voice amplification in hopes of making that dialog track come through just a little bit clear. But of course, that's more band aid than it is solution. The way movies get mixed likely isn't going to revert back to super pristine dialogue. So the solutions we have are, one: Buy better speakers and only go to theaters that have impeccable sound. Two: take a chill pill and try to just worry a little bit less about picking up every single word that gets said. Or, three... Just keep the subtitles on. For people who are deaf or hard of hearing subtitles make movies and TV shows accessible and this accessibility has just expanded in recent years. Laws have been passed to ensure that movie theaters have at least a few screenings a week with captions. Pretty much every streaming service has standardized them and speech recognition technology has made them accessible in pretty much every YouTube video and TikTok.

"language": "en", "content": "At the height of the 2016 election researchers released a report warning about a strange propaganda technique. Another day, another lie, another conspiracy theory, another falsehood. They called it the \"firehose of falsehood.\" When a propagandist bombards people with more lies than they can possibly keep up. Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? According to the report, these lies don't have to be believable. It wasn't just a lie. It was such a bad obvious lie. Researchers found that even obvious lies had the potential to be highly effective at shaping public opinion. I mean he just says things and then they are the truth in the world of the Donald. The thing is, that report wasn't about Trump. It didn't even mention him. It was about Russian propaganda. And it raised an interesting question: How could a powerful leader benefit from telling obvious lies? We've signed more bills than any president ever. The president just simply lies for no reason. I was against the war in Iraq. Why lie about something that you don't have to lie about? You have people registered in two states. They vote twice. Why does he keep repeating it if it's obviously not true? We're going to get to Trump in a minute. Hell yeah! But before that, we have to talk to Christopher Paul. I'm a senior social scientist at the RAND Corporation. He co-wrote the report on Russian firehosing and he described it as having four key characteristics. Russian propaganda is high volume and multichannel. It's rapid, continuous, and repetitive. It makes no commitment to objective reality. And it makes no commitment to consistency. Oooh, sounds like Trump. Can you give me a second? I'm building a narrative here. The first two characteristics are pretty standard for propaganda. Research shows that if we hear a lie from multiple sources, we think of it as more credible. The same is true for lies we hear repeatedly. The more familiar we are with a lie, the more likely we are to think of it as true. But the last two characteristics — no commitment to objective reality or consistency — that's surprising. They don't care that much about the truth. Much of their propaganda is either completely false or has a kernel of truth. Maybe the most jarring example this was in 2014, when the world watched as Russian troops entered Ukraine. There were a bunch of Russian soldiers wearing uniforms without insignia and those were dubbed “little green men.” This was a huge deal. Russia was essentially invading a country they had said they were not going to invade. But when Putin was asked about it: Were these Russian soldiers? No. These were local self-defense forces. Putin vehemently denied. “No no, the little green men are not Russian soldiers.” It wasn't just that Putin was lying. He was lying about something so obvious. There was footage of the soldiers airing on TV. Russian troops spreading out throughout the strategic Crimean Peninsula. And then, a few weeks later, he just said the opposite. Of course, we had our servicemen. They were acting very correctly. No “I'm sorry.” No “I misspoke.” Just, “Of course we have troops there.” This is counterintuitive. This is not what I expected. I come from an influence background that says credibility is king and the truth will always win. Part of being a good liar is not getting caught. Making sure your lies are at least somewhat believable. When Dick Cheney said, \"There is no doubt Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,\" he was lying, but to most people who aren't intelligence experts, it sounded credible. If someone asks, \"Hey did you eat my sandwich?\" You'd say, \"Nope. I brought my lunch from home.\" You wouldn't say, \"You never had a sandwich.\" But when it comes the firehosing, believability doesn't really matter. I think being willing to not be seen as credible is okay with the Russians. We'll come back to this. But right now it's TRUMP TIME! Trump time. Since the election, people have pointed out that Trump uses firehosing too. I really had no view that this would be anything that anyone would think about applying to American politics. That's not what I'm about. I am concerned with foreign intervention in our political processes. Okay, fine. Donovan, bring in the second interview please. Thank you. I think it can be deceptive just how different they look. But despite the different styles, I think they do the exact same thing. This is Masha Gessen. She's a Russian-American journalist, activist, and all around badass. And she's been warning about the similarities between Trump and Putin for years. They just create sort of this unmanageable volume of falsehood. Gessen argues that firehosing — telling and retelling obvious lies — isn't about persuasion. It's about power. When Putin says there are no troops in Crimea or when Trump says he never mocked a disabled reporter, they're not just lying. They're asserting that they are not constrained by reality. That everything, even things that are totally obvious to us, can be challenged. That's a very clear demonstration of power. You have to engage with what he said even though it's false. Those last two features a firehosing — the shamelessness, the inconsistency — they're kind of the point. The way that they lie that makes the obviousness of the lie part of the powerplay. Yes, I know that you know what I'm saying is absurd, and I assert my right to say whatever I want whenever I want to. He keeps urinating on the sidewalk and we have to keep wiping it up. Not the sidewalk, the living room rug. Yeah. On the rug! What are you cheering for right now? Our knee-jerk reaction to lies like this is to fact-check them. Fact checkers are having a field day with this one. President Obama did not found ISIS. He was not wiretapped, there was no warrant out. It is not the biggest tax cut in US history as the fact-checkers have noted. But if the goal of firehosing is to assert power, fact-checking misses the point. There is nothing quite so humiliating and disempowering as trying to prove the truth. Think of a schoolyard bully who says, \"Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?\" Degrading you by forcing you to argue with the obvious. \"Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?\" Yeah, you'd know about being bullied. I sure would. Thank you. And I think that's kind of what it feels like when we fact-check Trump. It's sullying. You feel like you've engaged with something that actually shouldn't be a part of the public sphere. Firehosing turns even the most obvious of facts into a messy, mind-numbing political fight. Every time he gets fact-checked Trump lashes out. They just don't want to report the truth. Sarah Sanders blames the media. If anything has been inflamed it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media. And something that should not have even been up for debate starts to look like just another screaming match where no one really seems credible. Donald Trump lies and he lies compulsively. So this very simple human assumption that you can know what's true, that assumption is taken away from you. You have to work for the truth and the hope is that, yeah, you'll get exhausted and you'll eventually give up. I'm getting depressed. I know, buddy. I'm almost done. We're all almost done. The ultimate goal of firehosing isn't to pass lies off as truth. It's to rob concepts like facts and reality of their power. You stand by that claim about him? I don't stand by anything. I have my own opinions, you can have your own opinions. To reduce truth to just a position. Isn't it important just to, like, have factual debates when discussing these things? Well, as you just commented, there's lots of different ways of looking at it. You're saying it's a falsehood and they're giving alternative facts. It's somebody's version of the truth, not the truth. Truth is truth. I don't mean to go like... No it isn't truth. Truth isn't truth. And if that sounds a little abstract, just listen to what Putin said during his press conference with Trump in July. As to who is to be believed, you can trust no one. He defends the interests of the United States of America. And I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. So Putin just basically wanted to establish as a baseline that no one can be trusted. Everybody's pursuing their own strategic interests and there's no such thing as the truth. And a few days later Trump took that argument a step further. And just remember, what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening. Just stick with us. Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. Just stick with us. Essentially, reality is about picking sides. They're basically saying there's no war between people who know the truth and people who are lying. There's only positional warfare. Whoever has a better position. Whoever has objectively more power owns reality. And it's remarkable how effective that is. Maybe you can just start acting like you have total power and it will not exactly give you total power but it will give you a hell of a lot more power than an American president should have. You never had a sandwich. You never had a... Come on man, you're killing me. Don't look at him if you don't have to. You never had... we have to unmic him. All right.
