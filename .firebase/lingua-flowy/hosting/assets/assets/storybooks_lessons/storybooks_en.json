winter, many people in the land were sick. Ma\n\nMonikazi's cheeks burned. Sweat dripped from her body. She\n\nwanted to hold the icy grass to her face to cool down. Under her\n\nblanket she held her belly and sang to the baby inside her: \"Be\n\nstrong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together\n\nwe're strong!\"\n\nHer stomach growled when the baby's powerful kicks woke her at\n\nnight. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life.\n\nOne bright night the moon was\n\nbigger, fatter and pinker than ever.\n\nHer breath came fast. The baby was\n\nready. The aunties in the birthing\n\nroom rubbed her back and warmed\n\nthe water. When Monikazi held her\n\nbeautiful daughter in her arms, she\n\nknew she was a special girl, a\n\nfighter.\n\nWhat a blessing! Her name is\n\nNontsikelelo. She will be the mother\n\nof all blessings.\n\nNontsikelelo was beautiful and\n\nstrong with crinkling black button\n\neyes. She loved her older brother,\n\nMcengi. He made her laugh and so\n\nthe laughter spread. She loved to\n\neat meat before she had teeth. Her\n\nfavourite aunt always kept a little\n\nportion on the side of her plate for\n\nNtsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens\n\nthat scratched in the garden where\n\nMa Monikazi grew spinach and\n\nsquash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran\n\nafter him as her legs grew strong.\n\nMa Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another,\n\nQudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded\n\nnapkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and\n\nfed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and\n\ntickled him till he laughed.\n\nShe taught them to sing: \"Be strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be\n\nbrave, little one. Together we're strong!\"\n\nQingqiwe, her grandfather, raised\n\nhorses. His favourite was Shishi, a\n\nglossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki\n\nwas old enough, he hoisted her on\n\nto the saddle in front of him. His\n\nstrong arms reached around her. He\n\nlaced the reins through her fingers.\n\nHe taught her to talk softly to\n\nShishi, to groom her with a hard\n\nbristled brush. When she stroked its\n\nglossy coat, Albertina whispered,\n\n\"You are the most beautiful\n\ncreature. Thank you for letting me\n\nride on your back.\"\n\nHer father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas.\n\nNtsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi's broad back. She rode out to\n\nmeet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her\n\nknees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers.\n\nHow proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki\n\nhad ever seen covered her father's face.\n\nOn her sixth birthday she went to\n\nschool. \"You must choose an English\n\nname,\" said the Presbyterian\n\nteacher, but Ntsiki liked her own\n\nname. \"Why do I need a new\n\nname?\" she asked. The teacher\n\nscowled and read the names aloud:\n\n\"Adah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.\"\n\nWhat did they mean? Ntsiki liked\n\nthe long name best.\n\nAl-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm.\n\nAl-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce.\n\nAlbertina was a name you didn't\n\nmess with.\n\nWhen her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town,\n\nAlbertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks\n\nbefore the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short\n\ntraditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her\n\nmother gave her the white flag and said, \"You have a big job, my\n\nblessing.\"\n\nAt the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned\n\nShishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the\n\nceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the\n\nguests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down\n\nflowers for the horse and the girl.\n\nHer mother was often sick and\n\nneeded Albertina to look after the\n\nhome. In her last year of primary\n\nschool, Albertina was the oldest\n\npupil in the school. She was chosen\n\nto be the head girl and wore her\n\nbadge with pride.\n\nHer best friend, Betty, told her\n\nabout a competition, saying, \"You\n\nmust apply, my clever friend.\"\n\n\"What is the prize?\" asked\n\nAlbertina, growing curious.\n\n\"A scholarship to high school!\" said Betty. \"You must apply. You'll\n\nwin it, for sure.\"\n\nAlbertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised\n\nsums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave\n\nher shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her\n\npaddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.\n\nThe test began. Albertina's fingers\n\nshook. The sums were tricky. Her\n\nmouth went dry. Her hand cramped\n\non her pencil but she continued.\n\n\"Well done, Albertina!\" said her\n\nteacher at the end. The important\n\nofficial arrived and called the top\n\ntwo students to the stage. \"Well\n\ndone to Albertina for full marks,\" he\n\nsaid, \"but you are too old. The\n\nscholarship goes to...\"\n\nAlbertina tried not to cry. \"That's unfair,\" shouted Betty, hopping\n\nwith fury. \"That wasn't in the rules!\" How would Albertina go to\n\nhigh school now? She dragged her feet all the way home.\n\nThe teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision.\n\nBrother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his\n\nbreakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He\n\npushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He\n\ndidn't like the story one bit either.\n\nSoon enough there was a\n\nscholarship for Albertina. Mariazell\n\nnear Matatiele was a long way from\n\nXolobe, but the whole village\n\nerupted. Their home girl was off to\n\nhigh school. She would make them\n\nproud. They threw a party like no\n\nother. The women brewed the\n\nsorghum beer and lit the fires. They\n\nslaughtered chickens and stirred up\n\npots of meat. Albertina smiled till\n\nher face ached.\n\nShe packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again.\n\nBefore setting off on the bus to\n\nMatatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat\n\nand stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into\n\nthe horse's silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends?\n\nWill I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and\n\nstamped the ground.\n\nSchool days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly\n\nin the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky\n\nporridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty's\n\nback home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on\n\nsunny afternoons.\n\nIn her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She\n\nrubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled\n\nsheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She\n\nhoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was\n\ntelling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their\n\neyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?\n\nAlbertina loved the nuns who taught\n\nher. Could she become a holy\n\nsister?\n\n\"But nuns earn no salary,\" said\n\nFather Bernard. \"Perhaps you\n\nshould become a nurse? You'll be\n\npaid while you study.\"\n\nAlbertina took a train to\n\nJohannesburg. She bought a smart\n\nwhite uniform, new navy shoes and\n\na shiny red fountain pen. Sick\n\npeople came all day to the hospital.\n\nShe cleaned their wounds with\n\ncareful fingers. She held the old\n\npeople gently. When the babies\n\ncried, she sang: \"Be strong, little\n\none. Winter's not long. Be brave,\n\nlittle one. Together we're strong!\n\nSome nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window\n\nand thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go\n\nto school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green\n\nspinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no\n\nvegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse.\n\nAlbertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her\n\ndays off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked\n\nthe ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money\n\nto send home.\n\nWalter Sisulu was a brave and\n\nclever man who dreamed of\n\nfreedom for South Africa. His big\n\nsmile captured Albertina's eye.\n\nThey walked together down the city\n\nstreets. Her delicate hand rested on\n\nhis arm. Walter wanted Albertina to\n\nbe the mother of his children.\n\nBright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men's Social Centre on their\n\nwedding day. Albertina's long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of\n\nlace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted\n\nflowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina\n\nhad become a mother. One day people would call her the mother\n\nof the nation.\n\nMax had his mother's black button eyes and his father's round\n\nchin. He was the hope for their future. Albertina wanted to fight for\n\na new South Africa, so that Max could be free. When he cried, she\n\nsang: \"Be strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one.\n\nTogether we're strong!\"\n\nPolice came in the middle of the\n\nnight, banging on the door.\n\nAlbertina scolded the men who\n\nmessed up her house. \"How rude\n\nyou are!\" she said, \"trampling mud\n\ninside my home.\"\n\nIn the morning Albertina's favourite flowers lay crushed beneath\n\ntheir footprints. She remembered chasing the chickens from her\n\nvegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her\n\ngarden. The earth, she knew, would recover.\n\nShe would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid\n\nfrom the police.\n\nShe joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria.\n\nThe women refused to carry a pass. They sang, \"Wathint' abafazi;\n\nwathint' imbokodo! You strike a woman; you strike a rock!\"\n\nMany hard years followed after Walter's arrest. He was jailed on\n\nRobben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many\n\ntimes. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely.\n\nBut even on the darkest nights, she\n\ncould see a sliver of moon through\n\nthe window in her cell. She sang the\n\nsong that Ma Monikazi sang before\n\nshe was born: \"Be strong, little one.\n\nWinter's not long. Be brave, little\n\none.

Father Bernard.","He\n\ndidn't like the story one bit either.","Soon enough there was a\n\nscholarship for Albertina.","Mariazell\n\nnear Matatiele was a long way from\n\nXolobe, but the whole village\n\nerupted.","Their home girl was off to\n\nhigh school.","She would make them\n\nproud.","They threw a party like no\n\nother.","The women brewed the\n\nsorghum beer and lit the fires.","They\n\nslaughtered chickens and stirred up\n\npots of meat.","Albertina smiled till\n\nher face ached.","She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again.","Before setting off on the bus to\n\nMatatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi.","Albertina brushed her coat\n\nand stroked her wiry mane.","She whispered all her questions into\n\nthe horse's silky ear: What if I get lost?","Will I make new friends?","Will I still be clever so far from home?","Shishi whinnied and\n\nstamped the ground.","School days started well before sunrise.","The girls washed quickly\n\nin the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass.","The milky\n\nporridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty's\n\nback home.","But Albertina studied hard.","She played netball on\n\nsunny afternoons.","In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station.","She\n\nrubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard.","She boiled\n\nsheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer.","She\n\nhoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family.","Who was\n\ntelling her brothers and sisters funny stories?","Who wiped their\n\neyes when they cried?","Who tickled them until they laughed?","Albertina loved the nuns who taught\n\nher.","Could she become a holy\n\nsister?","\"But nuns earn no salary,\" said\n\nFather Bernard.","\"Perhaps you\n\nshould become a nurse?","You'll be\n\npaid while you study.\"\n\nAlbertina took a train to\n\nJohannesburg.","She bought a smart\n\nwhite uniform, new navy shoes and\n\na shiny red fountain pen.","Sick\n\npeople came all day to the hospital.","She cleaned their wounds with\n\ncareful fingers.","She held the old\n\npeople gently.","When the babies\n\ncried, she sang: \"Be strong, little\n\none.","Winter's not long.","Be brave,\n\nlittle one.","Together we're strong!","Some nights Albertina worked till dawn.","She looked out the window\n\nand thought of her family.","Were the children hungry?","Did they go\n\nto school?","Who was riding Shishi?","She remembered the dark green\n\nspinach.","She missed the scent of the earth.","There was no\n\nvegetable garden here.","There was nowhere for a horse.","Albertina never went to parties.","She saved every shilling.","On her\n\ndays off she learned to play tennis.","Whoosh!","Plop!","She whacked\n\nthe ball across the net.","Always, she wished for a little more money\n\nto send home.","Walter Sisulu was a brave and\n\nclever man who dreamed of\n\nfreedom for South Africa.","His big\n\nsmile captured Albertina's eye.","They walked together down the city\n\nstreets.","Her delicate hand rested on\n\nhis arm.","Walter wanted Albertina to\n\nbe the mother of his children.","Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men's Social Centre on their\n\nwedding day.","Albertina's long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of\n\nlace.","Many friends blessed their special day.","Albertina planted\n\nflowers in her little garden.","Within a year, Max was born.","Albertina\n\nhad become a mother.","One day people would call her the mother\n\nof the nation.","Max had his mother's black button eyes and his father's round\n\nchin.","He was the hope for their future.","Albertina wanted to fight for\n\na new South Africa, so that Max could be free.","When he cried, she\n\nsang: \"Be strong, little one.","Winter's not long.","Be brave, little one.","Together we're strong!\"\n\nPolice came in the middle of the\n\nnight, banging on the door.","Albertina scolded the men who\n\nmessed up her house.","\"How rude\n\nyou are!\" she said, \"trampling mud\n\ninside my home.\"\n\nIn the morning Albertina's favourite flowers lay crushed beneath\n\ntheir footprints.","She remembered chasing the chickens from her\n\nvegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her\n\ngarden.","The earth, she knew, would recover.","She would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid\n\nfrom the police.","She joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria.","The women refused to carry a pass.","They sang, \"Wathint' abafazi;\n\nwathint' imbokodo!","You strike a woman; you strike a rock!\"\n\nMany hard years followed after Walter's arrest.","He was jailed on\n\nRobben Island for 26 years.","Albertina, also, was sent to jail many\n\ntimes.","Often she was scared.","Often she

World\n\nMeet my friend Helen. She was born\n\nin a little Karoo town called Nieu\n\nBethesda. There was not much\n\ngoing on in this town. But she made\n\na whole world here. She even made\n\nme. And she named her house after\n\nme.\n\nIt was called 'The Owl House'.\n\nMost of Helen's nine brothers and\n\nsisters were grown up and gone by\n\nthe time she arrived. But she still\n\nhad her sisters Annie and Alida.\n\nHelen didn't have many friends in\n\nthe village, but she didn't mind.\n\nFrom the start, Helen did things\n\ndifferently from most people.\n\nAfter her sisters left home, Helen\n\nlived alone with her parents. She\n\nloved her mother, but she hated her\n\nfather. Everyone agreed he was a\n\nvery strange man.\n\nHer big sister Alida travelled all over\n\nthe world. One day she sent Helen a\n\npostcard from Egypt.\n\nIn her mind Helen saw princes and\n\npyramids and camels in the sand.\n\nAs she grew older, Helen read more\n\nstories of faraway places. She\n\nespecially liked poems from Persia\n\nin the Middle East.\n\nShe dreamed of visiting the ocean\n\none day. She kept a seashell on her\n\nbedside table, and imagined she\n\ncould hear the sound of waves\n\ninside it.\n\nBut of course, owls were always her\n\nfavourite things of all!\n\nHelen loved books and stories so\n\nmuch that she decided to become a\n\nteacher.

He was also a teacher, and\n\na writer and actor.\n\nHe convinced her to run away with\n\nhim.\n\nHelen and Johannes got married.\n\nThey travelled to many different\n\ntowns, teaching and performing\n\nplays. Helen thought she might\n\nstart a family like her sisters had\n\ndone. But it was not to be. She and\n\nher husband were always fighting.\n\nWhen Helen's mother became very\n\nsick, she decided it was time to go\n\nback home.\n\nHelen was not happy. Her mother\n\nwas so sick, and her father was so\n\ngrumpy. She kept to herself. People\n\nthought she was strange.\n\nThe night her mother died, Helen\n\nkept a candle burning beside her\n\nbed all night.\n\nWith the help of that little light,\n\nHelen didn't feel so afraid of the\n\ndark.\n\nAnd remember, we owls were there\n\ntoo.\n\nWe watched over her, calling woowooh!\n\nHelen decided she wanted\n\nbrightness in her life. She began by\n\nchanging the space around her. She\n\nneeded helpers. Three men from\n\nthe village, Jonas Adams, Piet van\n\nder Merwe, and Koos Malgas, made\n\nthe things she imagined out of wire\n\nand cement. She filled her back\n\ngarden with interesting creatures.\n\nThere were sphinxes and camels,\n\nmermaids and cats.\n\nAnd lots and lots of owls! She called\n\nit her camel yard.\n\nOn the fence she made a wire sign.\n\nIt said: \"This is my world.\"\n\nDuring the day Helen made\n\nsculptures. At night, she practised\n\ncatching light.\n\nShe collected glasses and mirrors,\n\ncandles and lamps. Anything that\n\nwould shine.\n\nShe put lanterns in every room.\n\nMirrors caught and reflected the\n\nlight. She covered the walls in\n\nglittering glass so that they could\n\nshine too.\n\nAfter Helen's father died, she had\n\nthe house to herself. Each night she\n\nslept in a different room.\n\nShe would always choose the one\n\nwith the best view of the moon and\n\nthe stars.\n\nThe people of Nieu Bethesda would\n\nwalk past Helen's garden and\n\nmarvel at the creatures in it.\n\nSome of the village children brought\n\nher glass bottles for her sculptures\n\nand called her \"Miss Helen.\" She\n\nalways thanked them with sweets.\n\nOthers were not so friendly.

and the big trouble\n\nIn a small garden in the city, there\n\nwas a big tree. Many small animals\n\nlived together on the big tree.\n\nThere also lived a family of\n\nsquirrels.\n\nVikki was one little squirrel among\n\nthem who liked to talk big. His\n\ncousin, Kato from Far Forest had\n\ncome to visit him.\n\nOne evening, as all the animals who\n\nlived in the little garden were just\n\ngoing to sleep, they heard loud\n\nsounds from the park, next to the\n\nlittle garden.\n\nKato and the other squirrels saw big\n\nyellow machines, and men in hard\n\nyellow hats, pointing to the little\n\ngarden and other houses on the\n\nstreet.\n\nThey were going to pull them all\n\ndown and build a parking lot.\n\nThe people who lived there would\n\nmove to other houses. No one gave\n\na thought to the animals, birds and\n\ninsects who lived in the little\n\ngarden.\n\nThe machines were first spotted by\n\nthe mole family. To be more exact,\n\nby Mister Popples, the eldest who\n\ntold Master Mopples, who in turn\n\ntold the youngest, Little Popples.\n\nWhen they were young they were\n\ncalled Pop, Mop and Pip.\n\nMister Popples told the squirrels, the squirrels told the birds,\n\ncaterpillars, butterflies, tiny spiders and all those who lived in the\n\nlittle garden.\n\nThere was total panic, a lot of running, flying, scurrying and\n\nhopping, with no one knowing what to do? Where to go?\n\nThe caterpillars said, \"Let us look for leaves.\" The butterflies said,\n\n\"We want flowers.\" The mice wanted holes. The squirrels, birds,\n\ninsects wanted trees, bushes and grass.\n\nAll the animals wanted the soft earth, not cement or concrete.\n\n\"Where will we find all this?\" they cried. \"We will surely die,\" they\n\nsaid and wept.\n\nKato's uncle and aunt were very quiet and all the\n\nlittle squirrels crept close to their mom.\n\nKato cleared his throat and spoke shyly, \"I live in the\n\nFar Forest, may be we can all go there?\"\n\nThere was a buzz of excitement and someone said,\n\n\"How?\"\n\nKato scratched his head and thought hard, \"Well, the\n\nSquirrel Express can take the squirrels and the\n\nbutterflies, spiders caterpillars and all the insects.\n\nThe birds can either fly or come with us. The moles,\n\nmice and the grass snake family can go by the\n\nunderground Mole Express.\"\n\nEveryone thought it was a splendid idea.\n\nMister Popples rushed to ask Mister Grumbles, the\n\ndriver of the underground express train if he could\n\ntake them all to the Far Forest.

A group of cranes flew above\n\nthe playground and felt sorry for the\n\ncrying baby. They tried to get the\n\nchildren to notice that the baby was\n\ncrying but the children kept on\n\nplaying. The cranes decided to take\n\nthe baby and raise it themselves.\n\nFour cranes came to pick up the\n\nbaby from under the tree. Each\n\ncrane took a corner of the baby's\n\nblanket, lifted the baby up and flew\n\naway. The children did not notice\n\nanything because they were busy\n\nplaying.

She looked around and she\n\ncould not see anything. Then she\n\nlooked up and she saw four cranes\n\nflying away with her baby in the\n\nbright red blanket. She screamed\n\nand chased after the cranes. When\n\nthe woman told her husband what\n\nshe saw he did not believe her.\n\nThe cranes hid the baby between\n\nthe reeds to protect it. They wanted\n\nto find a new family that would care\n\nfor the baby. They fed it and put it\n\nto sleep. Then they flew away to\n\nlook for more food. The baby slept\n\nfor a long time without crying.\n\nWhen the baby woke up it started\n\ncrying because it was hungry.\n\nA big frog heard the baby's cry. It\n\ncame closer and saw the baby\n\nwrapped in the blanket. The frog\n\nthought the cranes had stolen the\n\nbaby, and decided to hide the baby\n\nfrom the cranes. Suddenly the frog\n\nheard the voices of the cranes.\n\nThere was no time to hide. The frog\n\nswallowed the baby and hid behind\n\na big rock. When the cranes arrived\n\nthey could not find the baby and\n\nthey flew off to look for it.

girl","language":"en","content":"Katitu Momambo, the clever little girl\n\nOnce upon a time there lived three\n\ngirls in a desert village in the\n\nKalahari. Katitu Momambo was the\n\nyoungest of the three. She was\n\nsmall but clever and wise.\n\nThe three big girls went into the\n\nveld one day to gather food and\n\nwood. Little Katitu ran after them,\n\nbut the sisters sent her back. \"Go\n\nback Katitu! You are too small to go\n\nwith us! Stay at home!\" they said.\n\nKatitu did not pay attention to\n\nthem. She followed them from a\n\ndistance.\n\nWhen they noticed her, they were\n\ntoo far away from home to send her\n\nback, so she joined them.\n\nWhile she was walking behind\n\nthem, Katitu cut herself some wood.\n\nShe made herself a bow and many\n\narrows.\n\nThe girls walked and walked and\n\nwalked until the sun dropped into\n\nthe Kalahari horizon. They were\n\nlost.\n\nThey walked into a deserted village\n\nand found a hut in which to spend\n\nthe night.\n\nAn old woman was sitting next to\n\nthe hut.\n\nLittle Katitu went and greeted her.\n\n\"Oh?\" answered the old woman,\n\n\"This is the village of the Big Snake!\n\nHe stays in a big hole in the cattle\n\nkraal. When people come to milk\n\nthe cows, he eats them! He will go\n\nto your hut at night when you sleep\n\nand kill you there!\"\n\nWise little Katitu did not panic. She asked the old woman for a\n\nhard cow skin to cover the door of their sleeping hut. Then Katitu\n\nwanted to sleep a little, so that she could stay awake throughout\n\nthe night. \"When the wind begins to blow,\" she said to her sisters,\n\n\"you must wake me up.\"\n\nThe wind came up, the sisters awoke Katitu and went to sleep.\n\nKatitu fixed the hard cow skin against the door of the hut and\n\nmade a little hole in the middle for her bow and arrows.\n\nKatitu heard the Big Snake approach.\n\n\"Hai, gom-gom, hai, gom-gom,\n\nwhere are they?\" sang the Big\n\nSnake.\n\nThe little clever girl answered him\n\nwith a chant, \"Here they are, here\n\nthey are!\"\n\nThen the Big Snake rushed against\n\nthe hard skin at the door of the hut.\n\nLittle Katitu shot an arrow through\n\nthe hole in the skin.\n\nYes, the little girl killed the Big\n\nSnake.\n\nThen Katitu woke up the older girls.\n\n\"Sister, sister, sister,\" she\n\nwhispered, \"get up, get up, get up!\"\n\nAnd when the girls woke up they\n\nsaw a big snake lying there.\n\n\"Come, we have to take him back to\n\nhis hole!\" shouted Katitu.\n\nThey rolled him up, rolled him up,\n\nrolled him up and they set him right\n\nback in his hole.\n\n\"Hurry! We have to run!\" And the\n\ngirls ran and ran and ran.\n\nThe next morning, the Big Snake's wife told his children to go and\n\nlook for him. When his children found him lying dead in his hole,\n\nthey screamed: \"Father is dead! Quick, let us go after those girls!\"\n\nAll the snake's children went after the girls.\n\nKatitu told her sisters to turn into trees. When the snakes arrived\n\nat the spot where they had seen the girls, only trees were standing\n\nthere. The snakes were tired and lay under the trees to sleep.\n\nWhen they were asleep, the girls turned back into human beings\n\nand ran on.\n\nThe girls continued to run and were\n\nvery tired and thirsty. Eventually,\n\nthey saw a waterhole! None of older\n\nsisters wanted to scoop the water\n\nfrom the deep well. They asked\n\nKatitu to climb in as she was the\n\nsmallest.\n\n\"Will you help me out of the well if I\n\nclimb into it?\" asked Katitu.\n\n\"Yes,\" they replied, \"we will help\n\nyou.\"\n\nKatitu went into the well and\n\nscooped water for her sisters.\n\nEach girl drank and then walked\n\naway. They all left Katitu in the deep\n\nwell and walked home.\n\nLater that evening, the elephants\n\ncame to drink. One of them drank\n\nand left. Another one drank and left.\n\nThe last elephant drank and\n\nswallowed Katitu with the water!\n\nA few drops of Katitu's blood\n\nsprayed onto the reeds growing at\n\nthe water hole.\n\nMeanwhile, Katitu's sisters had arrived home without any food or\n\nwood. They were crying and told the family that Katitu was lost.\n\nEveryone started searching for her.\n\nKatitu's little brother and his friend were searching too. They\n\nbecame very tired and rested next to a waterhole. They cut some\n\nreeds to make themselves flutes. When Katitu's brother played on\n\nhis flute, the flute sang by itself:\n\n\"Is this my brother who plays me, who plays me,\n\nThe other girls left me, left me and the elephant swallowed me,\n\nswallowed me!\"\n\nThe boy rushed home and handed the reed to his father, who\n\nplayed it. And again, the reed sang:\n\n\"Is this my father who plays me, plays me?\n\nThe other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me,\n\nswallowed me!\"\n\nThe father handed the reed to Katitu's mother, who played it. And\n\nagain, the reed sang:\n\n\"Is this my mother who plays me, plays me?\n\nThe other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me,\n\nswallowed me!\"\n\nKatitu's father called the young\n\nmen of the homestead and ordered\n\nthem to find the tracks of the\n\nelephants and find Katitu.\n\nThe young men hurried off. They\n\nmet the first group of elephants and\n\nasked them, \"Elephants, elephants,\n\nhave you seen the one who\n\nswallowed our girl?\"\n\nAnd the elephants sang:\n\n\"!a plaf! !a plaf! We trot lightly. We\n\nare so light, we carry nothing!\"\n\nAnd they passed on.\n\nThe young men met up with an old\n\nelephant in the bush and asked,\n\n\"Old elephant, elephant, have you\n\nseen the one who swallowed our\n\ngirl?\"\n\nThe old elephant sang:\n\n\"!a plaf! !a plaf! I trot lightly! I am\n\nso light, I carry nothing!\"\n\nBut now the young men heard a\n\nlittle voice in the belly of the\n\nelephant.\n\n\"Cut him open! Go on, cut him on\n\nhis left side, for I am sitting on his\n\nleft side!\" said the voice.\n\nThey held the old elephant down and cut open his belly. There was\n\nlittle Katitu lying inside! The young men took her out and carried\n\nher home. Katitu was welcomed as a hero by the villagers.\n\nAnd that is the tale of Katitu Mamombo. The wise little girl who\n\nsaved her sisters from the Big Snake, saved them from the snake's\n\nchildren, and (with the help of her brother) saved herself from the\n\nbelly of the elephant.\n\nOf course, her sisters were punished.\n\nStory notes\n\nJu|'hoan storyteller, Nxisae Magdaline Nxao, told a short version of\n\nthis story in Dkar, Botswana, in 2005 (Winberg 2009). In 1993,\n\nSigrid Schmidt recorded another version from Paulina Oxoros in\n\nnorthern Namibia (Schmidt 2007: 59). This particular version was\n\nretold by Marlene Winberg in 2013 for the Cave to Cave European\n\nUnion storytelling project in Spain, based on Nxao and Schmidt's\n\nrecording. The 'clever little girl' belongs to a well-known story type\n\nwhere a vulnerable young girl (or young boy), saves the lives of\n\nothers, by engaging her wit and the power of words, rather than\n\nsupernatural means to solve problems.\n\nThe illustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene\n\nWinberg, interpreted digitally by Satsiri Winberg through\n\nmanipulations of the Manyeka Art Collection of paintings made by\n\nSan artists.\n\nLicense: [CC-BY]\n\nText: Traditional San story\n\nIllustration: Manyeka Arts Trust\n\nLanguage: en","sentences":["Katitu Momambo, the

her\n\nback, so she joined them.","While she was walking behind\n\nthem, Katitu cut herself some wood.","She made herself a bow and many\n\narrows.","The girls walked and walked and\n\nwalked until the sun dropped into\n\nthe Kalahari horizon.","They were\n\nlost.","They walked into a deserted village\n\nand found a hut in which to spend\n\nthe night.","An old woman was sitting next to\n\nthe hut.","Little Katitu went and greeted her.","\"Oh?\" answered the old woman,\n\n\"This is the village of the Big Snake!","He stays in a big hole in the cattle\n\nkraal.","When people come to milk\n\nthe cows, he eats them!","He will go\n\nto your hut at night when you sleep\n\nand kill you there!\"\n\nWise little Katitu did not panic.","She asked the old woman for a\n\nhard cow skin to cover the door of their sleeping hut.","Then Katitu\n\nwanted to sleep a little, so that she could stay awake throughout\n\nthe night.","\"When the wind begins to blow,\" she said to her sisters,\n\n\"you must wake me up.\"\n\nThe wind came up, the sisters awoke Katitu and went to sleep.","Katitu fixed the hard cow skin against the door of the hut and\n\nmade a little hole in the middle for her bow and arrows.","Katitu heard the Big Snake approach.","\"Hai, gom-gom, hai, gom-gom,\n\nwhere are they?\" sang the Big\n\nSnake.","The little clever girl answered him\n\nwith a chant, \"Here they are, here\n\nthey are!\"\n\nThen the Big Snake rushed against\n\nthe hard skin at the door of the hut.","Little Katitu shot an arrow through\n\nthe hole in the skin.","Yes, the little girl killed the Big\n\nSnake.","Then Katitu woke up the older girls.","\"Sister, sister, sister,\" she\n\nwhispered, \"get up, get up, get up!\"\n\nAnd when the girls woke up they\n\nsaw a big snake lying there.","\"Come, we have to take him back to\n\nhis hole!\" shouted Katitu.","They rolled him up, rolled him up,\n\nrolled him up and they set him right\n\nback in his hole.","\"Hurry!","We have to run!\" And the\n\ngirls ran and ran and ran.","The next morning, the Big Snake's wife told his children to go and\n\nlook for him.","When his children found him lying dead in his hole,\n\nthey screamed: \"Father is dead!","Quick, let us go after those girls!\"\n\nAll the snake's children went after the girls.","Katitu told her sisters to turn into trees.","When the snakes arrived\n\nat the spot where they had seen the girls, only trees were standing\n\nthere.","The snakes were tired and lay under the trees to sleep.","When they were asleep, the girls turned back into human beings\n\nand ran on.","The girls continued to run and were\n\nvery tired and thirsty.","Eventually,\n\nthey saw a waterhole!","None of older\n\nsisters wanted to scoop the water\n\nfrom the deep well.","They asked\n\nKatitu to climb in as she was the\n\nsmallest.","\"Will you help me out of the well if I\n\nclimb into it?\" asked Katitu.","\"Yes,\" they replied, \"we will help\n\nyou.\"\n\nKatitu went into the well and\n\nscooped water for her sisters.","Each girl drank and then walked\n\naway.","They all left Katitu in the deep\n\nwell and walked home.","Later that evening, the elephants\n\ncame to drink.","One of them drank\n\nand left.","Another one drank and left.","The last elephant drank and\n\nswallowed Katitu with the water!","A few drops of Katitu's blood\n\nsprayed onto the reeds growing at\n\nthe water hole.","Meanwhile, Katitu's sisters had arrived home without any food or\n\nwood.","They were crying and told the family that Katitu was lost.","Everyone started searching for her.","Katitu's little brother and his friend were searching too.","They\n\nbecame very tired and rested next to a waterhole.","They cut some\n\nreeds to make themselves flutes.","When Katitu's brother played on\n\nhis flute, the flute sang by itself:\n\n\"Is this my brother who plays me, who plays me,\n\nThe other girls left me, left me and the elephant swallowed me,\n\nswallowed me!\"\n\nThe boy rushed home and handed the reed to his father, who\n\nplayed it.","And again, the reed sang:\n\n\"Is this my father who plays me, plays me?","The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me,\n\nswallowed me!\"\n\nThe father handed the reed to Katitu's mother, who played it.","And\n\nagain, the reed sang:\n\n\"Is this my mother who plays me, plays me?","The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me,\n\nswallowed me!\"\n\nKatitu's father called the young\n\nmen of the homestead and ordered\n\nthem to find the tracks of the\n\nelephants and find Katitu.","The young men hurried off.","They\n\nmet the first group of elephants and\n\nasked them, \"Elephants, elephants,\n\nhave you seen the one who\n\nswallowed our girl?\"\n\nAnd the elephants sang:\n\n\"!a plaf!","!a plaf!","We trot lightly.","We\n\nare so light, we carry nothing!\"\n\nAnd they passed on.","The young men met up with an old\n\nelephant in the bush and asked,\n\n\"Old elephant, elephant, have you\n\nseen the one who swallowed our\n\ngirl?\"\n\nThe old elephant sang:\n\n\"!a plaf!","!a plaf!","I trot lightly!","I am\n\nso light, I carry nothing!\"\n\nBut now the young men heard a\n\nlittle voice in the belly of the\n\nelephant.","\"Cut him open!","Go on, cut him on\n\nhis left side, for I am sitting on his\n\nleft side!\" said the voice.","They held the old elephant down and cut open his belly.","There was\n\nlittle Katitu lying inside!","The young men took her out and carried\n\nher home.","Katitu was welcomed as a hero by the villagers.","And that is the tale of Katitu Mamombo.","The wise little girl who\n\nsaved her sisters from the Big Snake, saved them from the snake's\n\nchildren, and (with the help of her brother) saved herself from the\n\nbelly of the elephant.","Of course, her sisters were punished.","Story notes\n\nJu|'hoan storyteller, Nxisae Magdaline Nxao, told a short version of\n\nthis story in Dkar,

Gingile's mouth began to water at the thought of honey. He stopped and listened carefully, searching until he saw the bird in the branches above his head.\n\n\"Chitik-chitik-chitik,\" the little bird rattled, as he flew to the next tree, and the next.\n\n\"Chitik, chitik, chitik,\" he called, stopping from time to time to be sure that Gingile followed.\n\nAfter half an hour, they reached a huge wild fig tree.\n\nNgede hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gingile as if to say, \"Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?\"\n\nGingile couldn't see any bees from under the tree, but he trusted Ngede.\n\nSo Gingile put down his hunting spear under the tree, gathered some dry twigs and made a small fire.\n\nWhen the fire was burning well, he put a long dry stick into the heart of the fire. This wood was especially known to make lots of smoke while it burned.\n\nHe began climbing, holding the cool end of the smoking stick in his teeth.\n\nSoon he could hear the loud buzzing of the busy bees. They were coming in and out of a hollow in the tree trunk – their hive.\n\nWhen Gingile reached the hive he pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow.\n\nThe bees came rushing out, angry and mean. They flew away because they didn't like the smoke – but not before they had given Gingile some painful stings!\n\nWhen the bees were out, Gingile pushed his hands into the nest. He took out handfuls of the heavy comb, dripping with rich honey and full of fat, white grubs.\n\nHe put the comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder, and started to climb down the tree.\n\nNgede eagerly watched everything that Gingile was doing. He was waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a thank-you offering to the Honeyguide.\n\nNgede flittered from branch to branch, closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gingile reached the bottom of the tree.\n\nNgede perched on a rock near the boy and waited for his reward.\n\nBut, Gingile put out the fire, picked up his spear and started walking home, ignoring the bird.\n\nNgede called out angrily, \"VIC-torr! VIC-torrr!\"\n\nGingile stopped, stared at the little bird and laughed aloud. \"You want some honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But I did all the work, and got all the stings. Why should I share any of this lovely honey with you?\" Then he walked off.\n\nNgede was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get his revenge.\n\nOne day several weeks later Gingile again heard the honey call of Ngede. He remembered the delicious honey, and eagerly followed the bird once again.\n\nAfter leading Gingile along the edge of the forest, Ngede stopped to rest in a great umbrella thorn. \"Ahh,\" thought Gingile. \"The hive must be in this tree.\" He quickly made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking branch in his teeth. Ngede sat and watched.\n\nGingile climbed, wondering why he didn't hear the usual buzzing. \"Perhaps the hive is deep in the tree,\" he thought to himself. He pulled himself up another branch. But instead of the hive, he was staring into the face of a leopard!\n\nLeopard was very angry at having her sleep so rudely interrupted. She narrowed her eyes, opened her mouth to reveal her very large and very sharp teeth.\n\nBefore Leopard could take a swipe at Gingile, he rushed down the tree.\n\nIn his hurry he missed a branch, and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he could. Luckily for him, Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him. Ngede, the Honeyguide, had his revenge.\n\nAnd Gingile learned his lesson.\n\nAnd so, when the children of Gingile hear the story of Ngede they have respect for the little bird.

Maathai","language":"en","content":"A Tiny Seed: The Story of Wangari Maathai\n\nIn a village on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa, a little girl worked in the fields with her mother. Her name was Wangari.\n\nWangari loved being outside. In her family's food garden she broke up the soil with her machete. She pressed tiny seeds into the warm earth.\n\nHer favourite time of day was just after sunset. When it got too dark to see the plants, Wangari knew it was time to go home.\n\nShe would follow the narrow paths through the fields, crossing rivers as she went.\n\nWangari was a clever child and couldn't wait to go to school. But her mother and father wanted her to stay and help them at home.\n\nWhen she was seven years old, her big brother persuaded her parents to let her go to school.\n\nShe liked to learn! Wangari learnt more and more with every book she read. She did so well at school that she was invited to study in the United States of America.\n\nWangari was excited! She wanted to know more about the world.\n\nAt the American university Wangari learnt many new things. She studied plants and how they grow. And she remembered how she grew: playing games with her brothers in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Kenyan forests.\n\nThe more she learnt, the more she realised that she loved the people of Kenya. She wanted them to be happy and free.\n\nThe more she learnt, the more she remembered her African home.\n\nWhen she had finished her studies, she returned to Kenya. But her country had changed. Huge farms stretched across the land. Women had no wood to make cooking fires. The people were poor and the children were hungry.\n\nWangari knew what to do. She taught the women how to plant trees from seeds. The women sold the trees and used the money to look after their families. The women were very happy.

After her father died, she lived alone with her mother. One day her mother decided that they would move to another village to start a new life. Tselane did not want to leave her old village and she started to cry.\n\nHer mother was scared to leave her daughter alone because giants lived in the caves nearby that village.

Then her mother kissed her and went back to her new home.\n\nA giant was hiding in the bushes, watching and listening to Tselane and her mother!

You are not my mother! You are a giant!\" shouted Tselane.\n\nThe giant walked away disappointed and disappeared into the caves. Every morning and every evening, Tselane's mother brought her food. Every morning and every evening, the giant also came. But each time Tselane sent him away. She recognised his deep voice as he sang her mother's song.\n\nOne day the giant had an idea. \"I can change my voice to resemble that of Tselane's mother!\" he said to himself.

When the stone was very hot and red, he took it out of the fire and swallowed it! \"Kudutlu!\" went the hot stone down the throat of the giant.\n\nThe giant started singing.

Somehow, the villagers\n\nwere always busy and they began\n\nto neglect the rain bird. \"It will rain\n\nanyway,\" they said. \"It's time to\n\nstop spoiling that silly old bird!\"\n\nBut the people were wrong. When\n\nthey stopped looking after the bird,\n\nthe rain stopped falling.\n\nThe crops began to dry up and die,\n\nand the animals grew thin and\n\nweak. Still, nobody in the village\n\nwent into the forest to feed the bird\n\nthat brought the rain. Now they\n\nwere all too busy trying to find\n\nmoney to buy food in the\n\nneighbouring town.\n\nOne scorching day, a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the\n\nforest after school. \"At least it will be cool in there,\" she thought to\n\nherself. She walked and walked, and after some time, she came to\n\nthe tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree.\n\nSuddenly, she remembered how her granny had taken her into the\n\nforest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened\n\nher school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her\n\nlunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then,\n\nbecause she had no thumb piano with her, she sang an old song\n\nthat she had known all her life.\n\nWith a loud whooshing sound, a\n\nbeautiful blue bird swooped out of\n\nthe branches above Ketti's head\n\nand began to eat the bread. When\n\nthe bird had finished, she opened\n\nher mouth and sang a few pure,\n\nhigh notes.\n\nThen she raised her shiny wings\n\nand all of a sudden Ketti heard the\n\nrumble of thunder. By the time she\n\nreached her home, giant rain drops\n\nwere pelting down, cooling the\n\nbaking red earth.\n\nKetti was very happy, until she told her parents what had\n\nhappened. \"Don't be silly!\" scolded her mother. \"Nobody believes\n\nthat bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!\"\n\n\"Your mother is right,\" said Ketti's father. \"The drought has been\n\nbroken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread\n\nfeeding that greedy old bird again!\"\n\nThough Ketti didn't argue with her parents, she felt sure they were\n\nwrong. \"If only Granny were still alive,\" she said to herself, \"she\n\nwould have believed me!\" But Ketti's granny had died a few years\n\nearlier. The only thing Ketti had left, was her granny's old thumb\n\npiano.\n\nTwo weeks passed and there was no\n\nmore rain. The crops began to\n\nshrivel up again and the hungry\n\nanimals' ribs began to stick out\n\neven more. The sun beat down\n\nmercilessly from a glaring blue sky.\n\n\"I don't care what they say!\"\n\nthought Ketti. \"We need rain. I'm\n\ngoing to feed the bird again\n\ntomorrow!\"\n\nSo, early the next morning, after\n\ntaking a slice of bread and a\n\nhandful of red berries from the\n\nkitchen, Ketti slipped out of the\n\nhouse. She began to make her way\n\nto the centre of the forest.\n\nWhat she didn't realise, was that\n\nher father was also awake. When he\n\nsaw what his daughter was doing,\n\nhe realised that she was going to\n\nfeed the rain bird again.\n\n\"I'll teach that disobedient child a lesson!\" he said to himself\n\nangrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti\n\ninto the forest.\n\nJust as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for\n\nit, her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The\n\narrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing\n\nshriek.\n\nTerrified, Ketti spun around − just in time to see her father fall\n\ndown, stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around − just in\n\ntime to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body.\n\nThen the bird, unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of\n\nthe tree.\n\nKetti raced out of the forest to a\n\nscene of utter devastation. Every\n\nanimal and every person she saw\n\nlay dead on the ground. With a\n\npounding heart, she ran all the way\n\nback to her home.\n\nShe quickly found her granny's old\n\nthumb piano. \"This is my only\n\nhope!\" she thought. \"The rain bird is\n\nangry. I have to make her happy\n\nagain! I HAVE to!\"\n\nHalf an hour later, Ketti was back at\n\nthe base of the big tree. Her body\n\nwas drenched with sweat and she\n\nwas gasping for breath. A few paces\n\naway from her lay the lifeless body\n\nof her father.\n\nKetti looked away quickly, and with\n\ntrembling hands, began to play the\n\nthumb piano.\n\nShe played and played, until her\n\nfingers hurt.\n\nFinally, what she wanted most in\n\nthe world happened. Down swooped\n\nthe bird as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe bird ate some of the berries still\n\nlying on the ground and sang a few\n\nnotes. Then, as Ketti played on, the\n\nbird raised her wings. Ketti heard a\n\nrustle behind her.\n\nIt was her father who had woken\n\nup.\n\n\"I'm sorry!\" he said again and again\n\nto the big, blue bird.\n\nThen he held out his hand to his\n\ndaughter and they walked slowly\n\nback to the village. In the village all\n\nthe people and animals were alive\n\nagain.\n\nThat night the villagers held a\n\nmeeting. They all agreed that they\n\nhad learned a valuable lesson.

They were going to the\n\nforest to get firewood.

In the darkness, yellow\n\neyes were gleaming. She was\n\nsurrounded by hyenas!\n\nShe was too terrified even to\n\ncry out. She tried running, but\n\nthe hyenas circled her hungrily.\n\n\"Don't move,\" said the gruff\n\nvoice of the biggest hyena.\n\n\"If you run, we'll eat you!\"\n\n\"Please let me go home!\"\n\nMulongo pleaded.\n\nBut instead the hyenas took\n\nMulongo to their house in the\n\nforest. It was a dirty hut full of\n\nbones and buzzing flies.\n\nShe lay down and pretended to\n\ngo to sleep.\n\nIn the darkness, she heard the\n\nhyenas talking to each other.\n\n\"How is the fire doing?\" one\n\nhyena asked. \"Is the water\n\nboiling?\"\n\n\"Everything is ready,\" was the\n\nreply. \"Should I bring her?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" growled the other\n\nhyenas. \"We're hungry!\"\n\nThey were ready to drag\n\nMulongo out of the hut.\n\nBut the big hyena spoke,\n\n\"Hyenas, wait. Remember the\n\nrule of the village. No hyena\n\nmay eat alone. We have to\n\ninvite the whole family to share\n\na meal.\"\n\n\"I'll go and call the in-laws,\"\n\nsaid his wife.\n\n\"I'll go and fetch my cousins,\"\n\nsaid the small hyena.\n\n\"I'll fetch our brothers and\n\nsisters,\" said another.\n\n\"And I will remain here with our\n\nfood,\" said the big hyena.\n\nThe big hyena sat in the\n\ndoorway of the hut and the\n\nothers went off in different\n\ndirections.\n\nThey took a long time, and the\n\nbig hyena began to doze in\n\nfront of the warm fire. Soon he\n\nwas snoring.\n\nThis was Mulongo's chance! But\n\nhow was she going to get past\n\nthe hyena?

spirit of Spring\n\nThe Winter cold had passed.\n\nSpring was coming to Nkanyezi's village.\n\nSoon the villagers would gather to celebrate the new season. Nkanyezi looked forward to the Spring festival more than any other day in the year.\n\nOne warm morning, Nkanyezi overheard two village elders talking about the festival.\"The people of Ndlovu have lost their spirit of celebration,\" one sighed.\"How can we have a Spring festival in a village that has forgotten how to celebrate?\" asked another.\n\nNkanyezi was worried.\"How will the sun shine again unless we sing to wake it from its winter slumber?\" she asked herself.\n\nNkanyezi thought for a long time.\"I must find what we have lost,\" she decided.\"I must go in search of things that will bring back the spirit of celebration to my village.\"\n\nThe elders gave Nkanyezi their blessing for the journey. They gave her a bag to carry the things she would find.\n\nNkanyezi was afraid, but she believed she would succeed.\n\nNkanyezi walked all day. She hiked up a hill, and down into a valley. She sailed across the great river, and climbed between sharp rocks. She marched across the plains until she reached the shadow of the red mountains.\n\nAs night was closing in, Nkanyezi arrived at a village of patterns and colours as she had never seen before. She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people.\n\nThe mother of this tribe gave Nkanyezi a gift. She told the girl, \"With love we give to you this paint to restore colour to a village that has gone dull.\"\n\nNkanyezi thanked the elders and put the paint in her bag.\n\nEarly the next morning she went on her way, excited with this gift of colour.\n\nNkanyezi walked all day, through a vast forest of giant trees. As the sky became too dark for her to see, she heard the sound of beating drums. She hurried towards the drumming, feeling the spirit of dance coming to her tired feet.\n\nNkanyezi found herself in the village of the Bhubezi. People were sitting around a fire, drumming and singing. She had never before heard such wonderful music.\n\nShe told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people. The Bhubezi invited her to rest and stay the night.\n\nIn the morning the chief called on Nkanyezi.\"My child,\" he said, \"here is a special drum. It plays a new song every time you beat it.\"\n\nNkanyezi thanked the elders and put the drum in her bag. She went on her way again, delighted with this gift of music and dance.\n\nOn the third day of her journey, as she a passed a field of fat cows, her nose started to tingle. An aroma tickled her taste buds and her mouth started to water. She followed the scent, and arrived in a village to find people standing over steaming pots of stew.\n\nThis tribe was famous for its feasts and Nkanyezi had never before tasted such flavours. After she had eaten her fill, she told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people.\n\nThe next day, the council of cooks gave her a secret spice blend.\"Our daughter,\" they said, \"with these spices, happy tummies are guaranteed! We give you the gift of good food.\"\n\nNkanyezi thanked the elders and put the spices in her bag.\n\nShe knew she had everything she needed. With new energy she started the long journey back to the village of Ndlovu.\n\nWhen she arrived home the villagersgathered around her to hear of heradventures.

He\n\nbullied his wife and treated her like\n\na child.\n\nOne day Mpunzi was very angry and\n\nhe hit his wife with a stick. She ran\n\naway back to her family. She left\n\nwith a sad heart because Mpunzi\n\ndid not let her take Nosisa with her.\n\nMpunzi bullied his daughter in the\n\nsame way he bullied his wife.\n\nNosisa lived a very sad life.\n\nMpunzi decided to marry another\n\nwife. He hoped that the new wife\n\nwould give him a baby boy.\n\nNosisa's life became even more\n\ndifficult when her father married\n\nagain. Mpunzi scolded her all the\n\ntime and made her serve the new\n\nwife. Nosisa worked like a slave.\n\nMpunzi was very proud of his cattle. He used to sit outside his\n\nhomestead and watch his cattle grazing in the field. He felt very\n\nsatisfied with his wealth.\n\nMpunzi's many servants cleaned around the homestead, and\n\nlooked after his goats, cattle and sheep. They milked the cows for\n\nfresh milk that Mpunzi sold to other villagers.\n\nMpunzi loved his new wife very\n\nmuch. He treated her like a queen.\n\nShe sat inside her hut all day and\n\ngave orders to Nosisa and the\n\nservants. Nosisa woke up early\n\nevery day to make tea for her\n\nstepmother. She cleaned her hut\n\nand cooked for her, but her\n\nstepmother always complained that\n\nher food was cold, her tea was\n\nweak, and her hut was not clean.\n\nOne day Mpunzi became very angry at Nosisa. He\n\nscolded her and hit her with a stick. Nosisa ran off to\n\nthe river where she sat and cried the whole\n\nafternoon.\n\nSuddenly she heard a voice coming out of the river.\n\nShe looked up and saw a big fish. The voice was\n\ncoming from the fish. Nosisa was so shocked she\n\nalmost ran away, but the fish stopped her. \"Please\n\ndon't run away my daughter, I am your mother. I\n\nhave changed myself into a fish so that your father\n\ndoes not know it's me.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the\n\nfish. Nosisa told the fish everything\n\nabout her sad life. \"Don't worry my\n\ngirl. I will bring you food every day,\"\n\nsaid the fish. The fish gave fresh\n\nvegetables to Nosisa. She had a\n\nfeast. When she looked up the fish\n\nwas gone. That day Nosisa went\n\nhome smiling. She would not have\n\nto go to bed without food as usual.\n\nNosisa went to the river every day. In the morning\n\nshe woke up as usual and did her chores around the\n\nhouse. At midday, she went to the river. She called\n\nout every time, and every time the fish would appear\n\nwith delicious food. Nosisa became happier and\n\nhappier. She could talk to the fish about anything.\n\nShe started to regain her health. Her skin was\n\nglowing and she was a happy child.\n\nNosisa visited the fish every day until her stepmother\n\nbecame suspicious. Nosisa had gained weight and\n\nshe was glowing. \"Something is going on at the river,\n\nI must find out what it is,\" thought the stepmother.\n\nOne afternoon she followed Nosisa to the river. She\n\nsaw Nosisa talking to the fish, and getting delicious\n\nfood. Nosisa's secret was out. \"I have to do\n\nsomething about this fish,\" said the stepmother.\n\nIn the evening, Mpunzi came back from the fields. He\n\nfound his new wife crying in her hut. \"What is wrong\n\nmy lovely wife,\" asked Mpunzi.\n\n\"I went to a traditional doctor,\" said the wife. \"He\n\ntold me that the only way for me to give you a son is\n\nto eat the biggest fish that lives in this nearby river,\"\n\nshe said. \"Will you catch the fish for me tonight?\"\n\npleaded the woman.\n\n\"I will do anything for you my beautiful wife,\" said\n\nMpunzi.\n\nMpunzi set off to the river before it was too dark. He\n\ntook his servants to help him find the biggest fish in\n\nthat river. They searched and searched and\n\neventually Mpunzi caught the biggest fish. He put it\n\nin a bag and went home with it. When he got to the\n\nhouse, there was a good hot fire ready to cook the\n\nfish.\n\n\"I will make the best meal ever for us,\" said the\n\nwoman to Mpunzi. \"You are the bravest and\n\nstrongest man I know.\"\n\nMpunzi was very pleased with himself.\n\nThat night Mpunzi and his wife went to bed happy\n\nafter their delicious meal. They left the bones on the\n\ntable for Nosisa to clean in the morning.\n\nWhen Nosisa brought coffee into their hut in the\n\nmorning they were still sleeping. \"This is very\n\nstrange,\" she thought to herself. \"My father usually\n\nwakes up very early in the morning to go to the\n\nfields. I wonder why he is still sleeping.\"\n\n\"Anyway, now I can run to the river for a nice\n\nbreakfast,\" she thought. Nosisa ran to the river.\n\nWhen she got there she called out to the fish, and\n\nshe called again and again. The fish never came.\n\nNosisa started to cry. She did not know what had\n\nhappened to the fish.\n\nWhile she was crying a bird came to sit next to her\n\nand told her what had happened. She cried harder\n\nthinking that her mother had been caught and eaten.\n\nThe bird told her to collect the fish bones from the\n\ntable and throw them back into the river. If she did\n\nthat the fish would come back to life. The bird also\n\ntold her to let her father and stepmother sleep and\n\nwake them up only at midday. Nosisa did as she was\n\ntold. She ran back home and walked quietly into her\n\nfather's hut. They were still fast asleep. She took the\n\nbones, put them inside a bag and threw them back\n\ninto the river.\n\nNosisa ran back home and just before midday she\n\nwoke her father and stepmother. She could hardly\n\nrecognise them. They looked old and grey and frail.\n\nThey were too old to scold her. They were too weak\n\nto hit her. They were too tired to look after the\n\nhomestead.\n\nSo, Nosisa took over the homestead and her father's\n\nwealth. She called all the servants and told them\n\nwhat had happened.

But king\n\nKayanja demanded a very high\n\nbride price for the princess.\n\nNear king Kayanja's palace lived a\n\nchief called Aludah the Great. He\n\nwas called \"the Great\" because\n\neverybody in the neighbourhood\n\nobeyed him. (He was very violent to\n\nanyone who disobeyed him!)\n\nChief Aludah's wife had recently\n\ndied of malaria and he wanted\n\nanother wife.\n\nSo the fat old chief went to king\n\nKayanja to offer bride wealth for the\n\nyoung princess.\n\nWhile the two men were discussing\n\nthe price, the maid Kakembo\n\noverheard their conversation. Maid\n\nKakembo was very close to princess\n\nApenyo.\n\nChief Aludah agreed to give half of\n\nhis wealth to king Kayanja,\n\nincluding a needle, which was also\n\npart of the bride price.\n\nPreparations were made in secret\n\nfor the wedding between chief\n\nAludah and princess Apenyo. The\n\nking knew that his daughter would\n\nnot be happy with this decision.\n\nOne week before the royal wedding\n\nday, maid Kakembo approached\n\nApenyo.\n\n\"My dear princess, your father has\n\norganised your wedding with Chief\n\nAludah, and it will take place in one\n\nweek,\" said Kakembo.\n\nPrincess Apenyo was shocked and\n\nat first didn't know what to do.

He\n\nthen put his hand deep in his\n\npocket and took out a cowrie shell\n\nto give to Kategga.\n\nWhen Kategga heard their story and\n\nsaw the beautiful shell, he felt sorry\n\nfor them. He agreed to row them\n\nacross the river in spite of the\n\nweather.\n\nKategga pulled the boat near the\n\nbank and told them to get in.

From the two dimples on its\n\nside came springs which converged\n\ndownhill to form a river.\n\nRiver Temu meandered silently\n\nacross the Kwere plains. Its waters\n\nwere a gift to the sheep and goats\n\nof the area as well as the deer that\n\ndwelt in the plains.\n\nThings were all well until Matata\n\nbecame headman.\n\nHe ordered a path to be cleared\n\nfrom the top of the hill to the foot so\n\nthat he could climb uphill easily and\n\nroll gently down to the foot.\n\nOlokwango hill was angry with the\n\ndamage to his beard, but he was\n\npatient.\n\nDuring the weekend, Matata's\n\nchildren and their friends would\n\nclimb uphill to play.\n\nThey would run all over the place,\n\nbreaking twigs and branches,\n\nlighting fires for their games, which\n\nthey would later leave burning.\n\nOver time, Olokwango lost patience.\n\nThe dimples became smaller and\n\nsmaller as his face turned into ugly\n\nwrinkles.\n\nAt last the springs were no more.\n\nThe deer in the plains migrated\n\nbecause there was no more tall\n\ngreen grass to play in. The sheep\n\nand goats grew thinner and thinner.\n\nEveryone felt the sadness of\n\nOlokwango hill.\n\nThe people of Kwere realised that something needed\n\nto be done.\n\nThey joined hands and overthrew Matata the\n\nheadman.\n\nIn his place they appointed Baraka who immediately\n\nordered everyone to plant a flower to honour\n\nOlokwango. Baraka and his people held ceremonies\n\nand brought gifts of pine, cedar, and cypress for\n\nOlokwango.\n\nNo one walked on the hill any\n\nlonger, and the grass had a chance\n\nto grow tall once again.

The village near here?\" asks Selma.\n\n\"Please tell us about the tree there,\" begs Toivo.\n\n\"Then sit and listen,\" says Grandmother and she begins her story.\n\nThere was once a girl called Thaimi who lived in the village of\n\nOmbalantu. One day she went with her brother, Angula, to fetch\n\nwater. While Thaimi was filling her pot Angula saw a hare. He ran\n\nafter it. He ran and ran and ran - but do you think he could catch\n\nthat hare? He could not. The hare was too quick for him.\n\nThaimi's pot was full and she was ready to go home. She looked\n\naround but she could not see Angula. She did not know where he\n\nhad gone. But, she did know that she couldn't go home without\n\nher little brother. So she set out to look for him. She walked and\n\nshe walked and she walked.\n\nAt last she found him lying in the grass behind a large anthill. As\n\nshe came close he held his finger to his lips. Why did he want her\n\nto be quiet? Close by a group of strange men were resting. The\n\nmen had bows and arrows...and spears! Thaimi could hear their\n\nvoices.\n\n\"Angula,\" she whispered, after she had listened for a bit. \"Those\n\nmen are raiders. They have come to steal our cattle and burn our\n\nvillage. Come quickly. We must run home and warn the village.\" So\n\nvery quietly Thaimi and Angula crept away from that place. And\n\nran towards their village.\n\nWhen they were near their village they met their uncle. He was\n\ntaking his cow to the water. Thaimi called out, \"Run, uncle, run!\n\nMen are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village.\"\n\nThe man shouted at his cow and made her run towards the village.\n\nFurther on Thaimi saw her aunt working in the field and she called\n\nout, \"Run, aunt, run! Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn\n\nour village!\"\n\nAnd the woman took her hoe, picked up her sleeping baby and ran\n\ntowards the village.\n\nFurther on Thaimi saw her grandfather. He was limping along the\n\nroad beside a donkey loaded with grain.\n\nAnd she called out, \"Run, Grandfather, run! Men are coming to\n\nsteal our cattle and burn our village!\"\n\nHer grandfather lifted his stick and chased the donkey until it ran\n\ntowards the village.\n\nAnd so Thaimi and her brother reached the village. And she called\n\nout to everyone, \"Run, run. Men are coming to steal our cattle and\n\nburn our village!\"\n\nThe villagers were scared. They ran backwards and forwards like\n\nants when a heap is trodden on by a cow.\n\nThey did not know where to hide or what to do.\n\nWhere could they hide their cattle?\n\nWhere could they hide their grain?\n\nWhere could they hide themselves?\n\nThaimi was very frightened. Then she remembered something.\n\nShe remembered the place where she and Angula sometimes went\n\nto play.\n\nA safe place.\n\nA secret place.\n\n\"I have a place!\" she cried. \"I know a place where we will all be\n\nsafe!\"\n\nBut the villagers could not hear her. They were making too much\n\nnoise. How could she make the villagers listen to her? What do you\n\nthink Thaimi did?\n\nShe picked up a drum and began to hit it as hard as she could.\n\n\"Bam Bam Bam Boom Boom Boom.\"\n\nAll the villagers stopped.\n\nThaimi called out, \"I have a place to hide. Follow me.\"\n\nShe took Angula by the arm.\n\n\"Come, we'll take everyone to our tree. We will all be safe there!\"\n\nHer brother shook his head.\n\n\"No, Thaimi. That is our secret. You said we must never tell\n\nanyone.\"\n\n\"Yes\", she said. \"It was a secret. But now we are all in danger.\"\n\nThaimi and Angula led the way to a baobab tree which stood\n\nnearby. Nobody could understand why.\n\n\"Why have you brought us here? We cannot hide here,\" they said.\n\nThen Thaimi said to her father, \"Come. I'll show you.\" They\n\nclimbed to the top of the tree. There was a small opening.\n\nThaimi and her father slid down into the big trunk. It was hollow. It\n\nwas huge. \"But all the people can't come in through such a small\n\nhole,\" said her father.\n\n\"No,\" said Thaimi. \"Bring axes and we will make an opening in the\n\ntrunk.\" And that is what they did. They cut an opening in the side\n\nof the tree. Some villagers collected the grain and the pots.\n\nOthers collected the goats, the sheep and the cattle. They all\n\nmade their way through the opening into the great hollow inside\n\nthe baobab tree.\n\nAnd the strange thing was that there was room for everyone.\n\nThe sun went down. It grew dark and the night was quiet and cold.\n\nThe raiders crept up towards the village. It was dark. \"Everyone\n\nmust be asleep,\" they said.\n\nInside the great tree the villagers waited.\n\nWhat was going to happen?\n\nThey were cold. They were hungry. And they were afraid.\n\nThen Thaimi said, \"It's cold. Let's make a fire.\" And she took two\n\nstones and struck them together. The sparks caught the grass and\n\nsmall flames flared.\n\nSoon a bright warm fire was burning.\n\nOutside the raiders crept closer and closer.\n\nThen suddenly one of them gave a cry and pointed to the tree.\n\nLight flamed from the tree. Fiery eyes shone from the trunk. Bright\n\ntongues licked the branches. Smoke curled into the sky.\n\n\"It's a great spirit!\" they cried in fear. First one raider turned and\n\nran.

The people\n\nwho lived there had been happy before, but then wild animals had\n\ncome and had begun to frighten them. These animals ate all their\n\ncrops and from time to time they even carried off children who\n\nwandered away from their parents. It was not a good place to live\n\nany longer, and the people began to think of where they might go\n\nto lead a new life.\n\nOne family found the answer. Rather than deal with the wild\n\nanimals who seemed to be everywhere on the flat land, they\n\ndecided to go in search of food up in the hills. It was not hard to\n\nfind food there. There were bushes that grew in the cracks\n\nbetween rocks. There were trees that grew at the foot of the\n\nslopes. There were rock rabbits which could be trapped and birds\n\nwhich could be brought down with the stones which littered the\n\nfloor of the caves.\n\nOther families noticed how well the hill family was doing. They saw\n\nthe sleekness of their children, and they noticed how calm the\n\nparents were.\n\n\"It is a good life that we lead up in the hills,\" said the husband.\n\n\"You should come there too.\"\n\nSoon the other families abandoned their homes on the flat land\n\nand went up to the hills. Each family found a cave to live in, and in\n\nthis way they were warm and secure. Soon everybody talked about\n\nhow sorry they were that they had not come to the hills earlier,\n\nrather than letting the wild animals eat their crops and drag off\n\ntheir children.\n\nAs the children grew up in the hills, they began to get better at the\n\nthings that had to be done to live in such a place. They became\n\nvery quick at climbing rocks, and even the youngest could\n\nscamper up a face of rock almost as quickly as any rock rabbit.\n\nThey also became good at climbing into trees to look for fruit, and\n\nthey could swing in the branches almost as well as any monkey.\n\nPeople who passed by and saw the hill people living on their hill\n\nwondered whether they were perhaps wild animals, but when they\n\nsaw their faces and the clothes that they were wearing they\n\nrealised that they were only people who had made the hills their\n\nhome.\n\nSlowly, things began to change. The parents noticed that their\n\nchildren were talking less, and that rather than speaking to one\n\nanother in the language of people they were beginning to use\n\ngrunts. Then the adults themselves noticed that their noses were\n\ngetting bigger and that they were growing hairier. Every time they\n\nlooked at one another they saw that their faces had changed yet\n\nmore and that their teeth were longer.\n\nSoon they spent as much time on four legs as on two, and it was\n\nat this point that they became a new creature. This creature,\n\nwhich had never before been seen in that place, was the creature\n\nwhich people now call the baboon.\n\nFor a time, the baboons lived happily. They stopped chasing the\n\nrock rabbits and started to eat grubs from the ground. They also\n\nforgot how to talk, and nobody now made any sound other than a\n\nbark or a grunt. They took off their clothes and let the rags lie on\n\nthe ground until they were destroyed by ants. Their legs and arms\n\nwere now completely covered with dark hair.\n\nThey still remembered, though, that they had been people, and\n\nthis was something which made them worried. When they looked\n\ninto each other's faces, they realised that their noses were now\n\nmuch bigger than they had been before, and this made them jeer.\n\nEvery baboon laughed at every other baboon, pointing at his\n\nenlarged nose and throwing his hands about in mirth. This made\n\nthe baboon who was being laughed at angry. He would jump up\n\nand down in anger, all the while laughing at the large nose of the\n\nother.\n\nEventually the mockery became so great that the baboons could\n\nno longer bear to be together. Each family split off and lived by\n\nitself, laughing at the others because of their great noses, but not\n\nliking to be laughed at for their own noses. That is why baboons\n\nlive in small groups today and do not live as a baboon nation, as\n\ndo people and many other animals.\n\nLicense: [CC-BY]\n\nText: Southern African Folktale\n\nIllustration:

their\n\nhome.","Slowly, things began to change.","The parents noticed that their\n\nchildren were talking less, and that rather than speaking to one\n\nanother in the language of people they were beginning to use\n\ngrunts.","Then the adults themselves noticed that their noses were\n\ngetting bigger and that they were growing hairier.","Every time they\n\nlooked at one another they saw that their faces had changed yet\n\nmore and that their teeth were longer.","Soon they spent as much time on four legs as on two, and it was\n\nat this point that they became a new creature.","This creature,\n\nwhich had never before been seen in that place, was the creature\n\nwhich people now call the baboon.","For a time, the baboons lived happily.","They stopped chasing the\n\nrock rabbits and started to eat grubs from the ground.","They also\n\nforgot how to talk, and nobody now made any sound other than a\n\nbark or a grunt.","They took off their clothes and let the rags lie on\n\nthe ground until they were destroyed by ants.","Their legs and arms\n\nwere now completely covered with dark hair.","They still remembered, though, that they had been people, and\n\nthis was something which made them worried.","When they looked\n\ninto each other's faces, they realised that their noses were now\n\nmuch bigger than they had been before, and this made them jeer.","Every baboon laughed at every other baboon, pointing at his\n\nenlarged nose and throwing his hands about in mirth.","This made\n\nthe baboon who was being laughed at angry.","He would jump up\n\nand down in anger, all the while laughing at the large nose of the\n\nother.","Eventually the mockery became so great that the baboons could\n\nno longer bear to be together.","Each family split off and lived by\n\nitself, laughing at the others because of their great noses, but not\n\nliking to be laughed at for their own noses.","That is why baboons\n\nlive in small groups today and do not live as a baboon nation, as\n\ndo people and many other animals.","License: [CC-BY]\n\nText: Southern African Folktale\n\nIllustration: Benjamin Mitchley\n\nAdaptation: Sheila Drew\n\nLanguage:

They welcomed each day just as it came.\n\nOn one morning, the boys were packing their mats after sleeping on cold pavements. To chase away the cold they lit a fire with rubbish.\n\nAmong the group of boys was Magozwe. He was the youngest.\n\nWhen Magozwe's parents died, he was only five years old. He went to live with his uncle. This man did not care about the child. He did not give Magozwe enough food. He made the boy do a lot of hard work.\n\nIf Magozwe complained or questioned, his uncle beat him. When Magozwe asked if he could go to school, his uncle beat him and said, \"You're too stupid to learn anything.\"\n\nAfter three years of this treatment Magozwe ran away from his uncle. He started living on the street.\n\nStreet life was difficult and most of the boys struggled daily just to get food. Sometimes they were arrested, sometimes they were beaten. When they were sick, there was no one to help.\n\nThe group depended on the little money they got from begging, and from selling plastics and other recycling.\n\nLife was even more difficult because of fights with rival groups who wanted control of parts of the city.\n\nOne day while Magozwe was looking through the dustbins, he found an old tattered storybook. He cleaned the dirt from it and put it in his sack.\n\nEvery day after that he would take out the book and look at the pictures. He did not know how to read the words.\n\nThe pictures told the story of a boy who grew up to be a pilot.\n\nMagozwe would daydream of being a pilot. Sometimes, he imagined that he was the boy in the story.\n\nIt was cold and Magozwe was standing on the road begging. A man walked up to him. \"Hello, I'm Thomas. I work near here, at a place where you can get something to eat,\" said the man.\n\nHe pointed to a yellow house with a blue roof. \"I hope you will go there to get some food?\" he asked.\n\nMagozwe looked at the man, and then at the house. \"Maybe,\" he said, and walked away.\n\nOver the months that followed, the homeless boys got used to seeing Thomas around. He liked to talk to people, especially people living on the streets.\n\nThomas listened to the stories of people's lives. He was serious and patient, never rude or disrespectful. Some of the boys started going to the yellow and blue house to get food at midday.\n\nMagozwe was sitting on the pavement looking at his picture book when Thomas sat down next to him.\n\n\"What is the story about?\" asked Thomas.\n\n\"It's about a boy who becomes a pilot,\" replied Magozwe.\n\n\"What's the boy's name?\" asked Thomas.\n\n\"I don't know, I can't read,\" said Magozwe quietly.\n\nWhen they met, Magozwe began to tell his own story to Thomas. It was the story of his uncle and why he ran away.\n\nThomas didn't talk a lot, and he didn't tell Magozwe what to do, but he always listened carefully.\n\nSometimes they would talk while they ate at the house with the blue roof.\n\nAround Magozwe's tenth birthday, Thomas gave him a new storybook. It was a story about a village boy who grew up to be a famous soccer player.\n\nThomas read that story to Magozwe many times, until one day he said, \"I think it's time you went to school and learned to read. What do you think?\" Thomas explained that he knew of a place where children could stay, and go to school.\n\nMagozwe thought about this new place, and about going to school. What if his uncle was right and he was too stupid to learn anything?\n\nWhat if they beat him at this new place? He was afraid. \"Maybe it is better to stay living on the street,\" he thought.\n\nHe shared his fears with Thomas. Over time the man reassured the boy that life could be better at the new place.\n\nAnd so Magozwe moved into a room in a house with a green roof. He shared the room with two other boys.\n\nAltogether there were ten children living at that house. Along with Auntie Cissy and her husband, three dogs, a cat, and an old goat.\n\nMagozwe started school and it was difficult. He had a lot to catch up. Sometimes he wanted to give up.\n\nBut he thought about the pilot and the soccer player in the storybooks.

Kumalo","language":"en","content":"Queen of Soweto: The Story of Basetsana Kumalo\n\nBasetsana Makgalemele was born\n\nin a township called Soweto. She\n\nwas her parents' third daughter.\n\nThey named her Basetsana, which\n\nmeans \"girls\". In Tswana culture,\n\ncalling your daughter that means\n\nyour next child will be a boy. This\n\nactually happened. Her parents'\n\nnext child was a boy. Her parents,\n\nbig sisters and younger brother all\n\ncalled her Bassie for short.\n\nWhen she was a child, Bassie was\n\nvery shy. She liked to sing and\n\ndance in her room on her own.\n\nOne day at school netball practice,\n\nthe coach told two girls to pick\n\nteams. Bassie stood on the edge of\n\nthe field hoping someone would\n\nsay, \"Come play with us!\" But\n\nnobody wanted her on their team.\n\nLittle did they know, Bassie would\n\nbecome one of the most popular\n\ngirls in the country.\n\nOn weekends, she and her brother\n\nand sisters helped their teacher\n\nmom and bus driver dad to pay the\n\nbills. They made sandwiches to sell\n\nat local soccer matches. They tried\n\nto sell everything as fast as they\n\ncould so they had time to play with\n\nthe other children when the game\n\nwas over.\n\nBy the time Bassie turned 16, she\n\nwas a beautiful young woman. She\n\nwas so beautiful that she won two\n\nbeauty competitions in one year:\n\nMiss Soweto and Miss Black South\n\nAfrica.\n\nBut Bassie was not only beautiful on\n\nthe outside. She was also beautiful\n\non the inside. Even though she was\n\na beauty queen, she still cared\n\nabout the community where she\n\ngrew up.\n\nBassie was also very smart. She\n\nworked hard at school, especially on\n\nher favourite subject: science. Her\n\nhard work was rewarded when she\n\nwas the top science student at her\n\nschool in matric. That's not all, she\n\nwas also Head Girl. The shy little\n\ngirl was now one of the most\n\npopular girls in school.\n\nBassie's father always encouraged\n\nhis children to read. He gave her a\n\nbook called The Power of Positive\n\nThinking. From that book, she learnt\n\nthat being optimistic is the key to\n\nmaking your dreams a reality. She\n\ndreamt of winning Miss South\n\nAfrica. Not only did that dream\n\ncome true, she was even crowned\n\nFirst Princess in the Miss World\n\ncompetition!\n\nBassie's mother was her role model.\n\nBassie described her mom as a\n\n\"fierce, hardworking Xhosa woman\n\nwho did not suffer fools\". She was a\n\nteacher and Bassie had plans to\n\nfollow in her footsteps, but things\n\ndon't always go as planned! After\n\nwinning Miss South Africa, she\n\nbecame a TV presenter. She wasn't\n\na teacher, but like her mom, she\n\nwas hardworking. Her career in TV\n\nled to her opening her own\n\ntelevision production company. She\n\nwas now a successful business\n\nwoman.\n\nBassie's motto is: \"To whom much\n\nis given, much is expected.\" She\n\nbelieves that you are given a gift so\n\nthat you can give to others. Bassie\n\ndoes this by volunteering, giving of\n\nher time and money and even\n\ncreating jobs. She is involved with\n\nprojects and charities to help\n\npeople in her community. One that\n\nis very close to her heart is the\n\nNelson Mandela Institute.\n\nBassie had a very close relationship\n\nwith Nelson Mandela. When she was\n\ncrowned Miss South Africa, Madiba\n\nwrote her a letter of\n\ncongratulations. In the letter, he\n\ncalled her \"our Queen\". They shared\n\na passion for children and education\n\nand the belief that an educated\n\nnation can help fight poverty.\n\nBassie married Romeo Kumalo and\n\nbecame known as Basetsana\n\nKumalo.\n\nTogether they established the\n\nRomeo & Basetsana Kumalo Family\n\nFoundation. The foundation looks\n\nafter orphans - children who don't\n\nhave a mom and dad.\n\nBassie has had to learn to balance\n\nher busy work and family life.\n\nShe has her own company called\n\nBasetsana Women Investment\n\nHoldings.

the\n\nmoney, and become a farmer.\n\nNews spread all over the village that Tortoise was looking for\n\nland to buy.\n\nWhen Hare heard the news, he had an idea! He rushed to\n\nsee Tortoise and said:\n\n\"Mr Tortoise! I can help you find land to buy. Come with me!\"\n\nThat very same day, Hare took Tortoise to visit a plot. He\n\npointed to a large field and said:\n\n\"I own all this land!\"\n\nTortoise was impressed.\n\nAfter bargaining for a while, they agreed on\n\na price and Tortoise paid for the land.\n\nThe next day, Tortoise got up bright and early.

The trees dried up and died. The rivers\n\ndisappeared and the water evaporated. People and animals began dying from hunger and\n\nthirst.\n\nLion and Elephant as the chief animals got together to discuss the situation. Lion said,\n\n\"We're going to end up dying from thirst. Let's call everyone together and discuss the idea\n\nof digging a well. Elephant agreed and went off to spread the news to all the animals.\n\nAll the animals except the hare got together to discuss the situation. Lion said, \"Look, my\n\nbrothers and sisters, this year, the rain has not fallen. Everyone is dying from hunger and\n\nthirst. Let us now make a plan to dig a well so that we might all be able to drink from it.\"\n\nAll the animals agreed and immediately grabbed hoes, shovels and picks and started\n\ndigging. They dug and dug. And they dug some more. Finally they hit water. Lion said, \"Why\n\ndid Hare not come to dig this well? He most certainly will not drink from this water!\"\n\nLater Hare came and saw the well. He said, \"Tipite, tipite at the well!\" He heard nothing. So\n\nhe went in, drank some water and splashed around for a while.\n\nThe next day, when the animals came they saw that their well was a big mess. The water\n\nwas nothing but mud. They asked, \"Who would do such a thing?\" Someone said, \"I bet it\n\nwas Hare. When we were digging the well he was nowhere to be found.\"\n\nAnd so the animals decided to leave a guard at the well. They\n\nchose Baboon to keep an eye on things. Baboon was at the well\n\nwhen Hare came at night saying, \"Tipite! Tipite! by the water!\"\n\nBaboon replied, \"Pitani!\" So Hare came over and greeted Baboon,\n\n\"I have come, my friend, and I bring that which the great ones like\n\nto eat!\" Baboon replied, \"Come, let's see what it is.\"\n\nHare had some honey. He went over to Baboon, \"Yes, my friend, try some of this!\" Hare\n\ngave him the honey. Then he drew some water from the well and drank it. Just as Hare was\n\nleaving, Hyena arrived and he saw Hare.\n\nThe next day, Hyena went and told all the animals that Hare had taken water from the well.\n\nSo they chose Turtle to guard the well. Hare arrived at night, saying, \"Tipite by the well!\"\n\nWhen he didn't hear any reply he said: \"I am Hare! I've come to drink water.\"\n\nWhen Turtle had arrived at the well earlier that night, she had hidden herself among the\n\nrocks. She looked just like another rock. As soon as Hare started to go into the water, Turtle\n\ngrabbed Hare by the leg. Turtle didn't say a word, she just sat there holding on until the sun\n\ncame up.\n\nWhen the animals arrived, they saw that Turtle had captured Hare. They called the rest of\n\nthe animals to decide what to do with Hare. When all the animals were assembled, Lion\n\nasked them, \"What shall we do with this Hare?\"\n\nTurtle said, \"Elephant should grab him with her trunk and beat him on the rocks.\" All the\n\nother animals agreed. Then Hare said, \"O Great Lion, you know that hares don't die if you\n\nhit them on rocks.

man who had plenty of everything – a large fertile farm,\n\nwith cattle, sheep, and goats.\n\nBut, as he grew old, he grew sad, because one thing was missing.\n\nHe did not have a wife.\n\nStanding under a tree one day, he\n\nhad a brilliant idea.\n\nIf he couldn't find a wife, perhaps\n\nhe could make one?\n\nSo he set to work to shape a\n\nbeautiful woman from a strong\n\nbranch of the tree. When he had\n\nfinished making the statue, he\n\ntouched her eyes, and they opened.\n\nHe blew gently on her, and she\n\ncame alive.\n\nShe was truly the most beautiful\n\nwoman he had ever seen.\n\nHe knelt before her, and asked her\n\nto be his wife.\n\nHe gave her a colourful apron,\n\nbeads, and a head ring, the sign of\n\na married woman. And he built her\n\na house with the mud and grass\n\nthat used to lie at the foot of her\n\ntrunk.\n\n\"Only one thing I beg of you,\" he\n\nsaid to his wife. \"Never tell anyone\n\nwhere you come from.\"\n\nBut before long, the young men\n\nfrom a neighbouring village began\n\ntalking among themselves.\n\n\"How can such an old man have\n\nsuch a beautiful young wife?\"\n\nSo they decided to steal her and\n\ntake her to their own kraal.\n\nThe old man was heartbroken. He\n\nfelt he could not live without her.\n\nBut then he thought, \"Perhaps if I\n\nhave something of hers, I would not\n\nfeel so sad?\"\n\nSo he sent his doves to find her, to\n\nsing to her, and to bring back\n\nsomething of hers to him.\n\nWhen they found her, they sang to\n\nher in the language of birds:\n\nTree woman, tree woman\n\nMore beautiful than any other\n\nYour husband has sent us\n\nTo bring back your apron!\n\nShe gave them her apron, and they flew over the hill, over the river, back to her husband.\n\nHe held the apron to his face, and was comforted for a little while.\n\nBut his longing did not go away.\n\nSo again he sent his doves to sing\n\nto her:\n\nTree woman, tree woman\n\nMore beautiful than any other\n\nYour husband has sent us\n\nTo bring back your head ring!\n\nAnd back they flew with the head\n\nring, the sign of a married woman.\n\nHe held the head ring and sighed\n\nfor his wife, far away in the kraal of\n\nother people.\n\nAfter a while, he called his doves\n\nagain.

They had\n\nsix children. All of them were\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen Namukhaywa was\n\npregnant with her seventh\n\nchild, Ndong'a warned her, \"If\n\nyou give birth to another girl, I\n\nwill leave you. But if you give\n\nme a baby boy, I will hold a big\n\nparty for you!\"\n\nWhen it was time to give birth,\n\nNamukhaywa went to the\n\ntraditional midwife. Would the\n\nchild be a girl or a boy?\n\nIt was a boy AND a girl – twins!\n\nShe called the boy Mukhwana,\n\nand the girl she called Mulongo.\n\nAs she looked at Mukhwana,\n\nshe was very happy. But as she\n\nlooked at Mulongo, she felt sad.\n\nShe felt that there was only one\n\nthing she could do.\n\nNamukhaywa left Mulongo in\n\nthe care of the midwife and\n\ntook Mukhwana home to her\n\nhusband.\n\nShe proudly showed Ndong'a\n\nthe baby boy. He was very\n\nhappy and called all the\n\nvillagers to celebrate the birth\n\nof his son.\n\nMukhwana grew up to be a fine\n\nyoung man. And Mulongo grew\n\nup to be a fine young woman.\n\nOne day, while minding his\n\nfather's cattle, Mukhwana saw a\n\nvery beautiful girl.\n\n\"This is the girl I want to\n\nmarry,\" he said to himself.\n\nBut when he asked her to marry\n\nhim, she sang this song:\n\n\"Mukhwana wefwe, Mukhwana.\n\nSo yakhupa omunwa,\n\nMukhwana.\n\nNebebula omukhana,\n\nMukhwana.\n\nBarulaka khulwanda,\n\nMukhwana.\n\nNebebula omusiani, Mukhwana.\n\nBarera mungo muno,\n\nMukhwana.\n\nIyeyi yakwa, Mukhwana.\n\nIyindi yakwa, Mukhwana.\"\n\nThis happened again and again.\n\nMukhwana did not know what\n\nto do. So he went to his mother,\n\nNamukhaywa.\n\n\"I have found a beautiful girl,\"\n\nhe said. \"And I want to marry\n\nher. But every time I ask her,\n\nshe sings the same song.\"\n\nTo his surprise, Namukhaywa\n\nsaid, \"What the girl is singing\n\nabout is true. That is your sister.\n\nYou were born twins.

She had been sick a lot recently and Hilifa was learning how to look after his mother and himself. When his mother was too ill to get up he would make a fire to boil water to make tea. He would take tea to his mother and prepare porridge for breakfast. Sometimes his mother was too weak to eat it. Hilifa worried about his mother. His father had died two years ago, and now his mother was ill too. She was very thin, just like his father had been.\n\nOne morning he asked his mother, \"What is wrong Mum? When will you be better? You don't cook anymore. You can't work in the field or clean the house. You don't prepare my lunchbox, or wash my uniform...\" \"Hilifa my son, you are only nine years old and you take good care of me.\" She looked at the young boy, wondering what she should tell him. Would he understand? \"I am very ill. You have heard on the radio about the disease called AIDS. I have that disease,\" she told him. Hilifa was quiet for a few minutes. \"Does that mean you will die like Daddy?\" \"There is no cure for AIDS.\"\n\nHilifa walked to school thoughtfully. He couldn't join in the chatter and games of his friends as they walked along. \"What's wrong?\" they asked him. But Hilifa couldn't answer, his mother's words were ringing in his ears, \"No cure. No cure.\" How could he look after himself if his mother died, he worried. Where would he live? Where would he get money for food?\n\nHilifa sat at his desk. He traced the worn wood markings with his finger, \"No cure. No cure.\" \"Hilifa? Hilifa, are you with us?\" Hilifa looked up. Ms. Nelao was standing over him. \"Stand up Hilifa! What was my question?\" Hilifa looked down at his feet. \"You won't find the answer down there!\" she retorted. \"Magano, tell Hilifa the answer.\" Hilifa felt so ashamed, Ms. Nelao had never shouted at him before.\n\nHilifa struggled through the morning. At break time he sat in the classroom. \"I have a stomach ache,\" he lied to his friends. It wasn't a big lie, he did feel sick, and his worried thoughts buzzed inside his head like angry bees. Ms. Nelao watched him quietly. She asked him what was wrong. \"Nothing,\" he replied. Her ears heard the tiredness and worry in his voice. Her eyes saw the fear he was trying so hard to hide.\n\nWhen Hilifa tried to do his maths the numbers jumped around in his head. He couldn't keep them still long enough to count them. He soon gave up. He thought of his mother instead. His fingers began to draw his thoughts. He drew his mother in her bed. He drew himself standing beside his mother's grave. \"Maths monitors, collect all the books please,\" called Ms. Nelao. Hilifa suddenly saw the drawings in his book and tried to tear out the page, but it was too late. The monitor took his book to Ms. Nelao.\n\nMs. Nelao looked at Hilifa's drawings. When the children were leaving to go home she called, \"Come here Hilifa. I want to talk to you.\" \"What's wrong?\" she asked him gently. \"My mother is ill. She told me she has AIDS. Will she die?\" \"I don't know, Hilifa, but she is very ill if she has AIDS. There is no cure.\" Those words again, \"No cure. No cure.\" Hilifa began to cry. \"Go home, Hilifa,\" she said. \"I will come and visit your mother.\"\n\nHilifa went home and found his mother preparing lunch. \"I've cooked for you today, Hilifa, but now I am very tired. Look after the vegetable garden and take some tomatoes to the shop. They will sell them for us.\" After lunch Hilifa went to the vegetable plot. He looked at the bright colours of the vegetables, bright red tomatoes and chillies, long green beans and dark green spinach, the green leaves of the sweet potato and tall golden maize. He watered the garden and picked a bag full of ripe red tomatoes to take to the shop. \"What would happen to their garden if his mother died?\" he wondered.\n\nMs. Nelao arrived soon after Hilifa left. She spent a long time talking to his mother. She asked Hilifa's mother, \"Meme Ndapanda, are you taking the medicine for AIDS?\" \"After my husband died I was too ashamed to go to the doctor,\" she told Ms. Nelao. \"I kept hoping I wasn't infected. When I became ill and went to the doctor she told me it was too late. The medicine would not help me.\" Ms. Nelao told Meme Ndapanda what to do to help Hilifa.\n\nWhen Hilifa came home his mother asked him, \"Hilifa, my son, I want to take a walk with you. Will you help me?\" Hilifa took his mother's arm and she leaned on him. They walked to where the tall thorn trees grew. She asked him, \"Do you remember playing football here with your cousin Kunuu? You kicked the ball into the tree and it got stuck on the thorns. Your father got scratched getting it down for you.\"\n\n\"Look, there's an omandjembere bush. Go and pick some to take home.\" When Hilifa was picking the sweet berries, she said, \"Do you remember when you were small you ate the berries and the seed inside. You didn't go to the toilet for a week!\" \"Yes, my stomach was sooo sore,\" remembered Hilifa, laughing.\n\nWhen they got home Hilifa's mother was very tired. Hilifa made some tea. Meme Ndapanda took a small box from under her bed. \"Hilifa, this is for you. In this box are things that will help you remember where you come from.\"\n\nShe took the mementos out of the box one by one. \"This is a photo of your father holding you. You were his firstborn son. This photo is when I took you to see your grandparents, they were so happy. This is the first tooth you lost. Do you remember how you cried and I had to promise you that more would grow. This is the brooch your father gave me when we were married for one year.\"\n\nHilifa held the box and began to cry. His mother held him close by her side and said a prayer, \"May the Lord protect you and keep you safe.\" She held him as she spoke. \"Hilifa, my son. You know that I am very ill, and soon I will be with your father. I don't want you to be sad. Remember how much I love you. Remember how much your father loved you.\"\n\nHis mother continued, \"Uncle Kave from Oshakati sends us money when he can. He told me that he will care for you. I have talked to him about it. You'll go to school with Kunuu, his son. Kunuu is in Grade 4 like you. They will take good care of you.\" \"I like Uncle Kave and Aunt Muzaa,\" said Hilifa. \"And I like playing with Kunuu. Would you become well if they look after you?\" \"No, my son. I won't become well. You look after me very well. I am proud to have such a good son.\"\n\nThe next morning at school Ms. Nelao taught them about HIV and AIDS. The learners looked afraid. They heard about this illness on the radio, but no-one spoke about it at home. \"Where does it come from?\" asked Magano. \"How do we catch it?\" asked Hidipo. Ms. Nelao explained that HIV is the name of a virus. When a person has the HIV virus in their blood they still look healthy. \"We say they have AIDS when they become ill.\"\n\nMs. Nelao explained some of the ways we can be infected with HIV. \"If someone has HIV or AIDS we can catch the virus from their blood. We should never share razors or toothbrushes. If we get our ears pierced we must use sterilised blades and needles.\" She explained how needles and blades should be sterilised. \"If we hurt ourselves and there is blood we must ask an adult to clean the wound. We must cover the wound to protect it,\" she told them.\n\nThen she showed them a chart. \"These are all the ways you can't catch HIV,\" she told them. \"You won't get HIV from using the toilet, or sharing a bath. Hugging, kissing or shaking hands with someone with HIV or AIDS is also safe. It's OK to share cups and plates with someone who has HIV or AIDS. And you can't catch it from someone who is coughing or sneezing. Also, you can't get it from mosquitoes or other biting insects like lice or bedbugs.\"\n\n\"What do you do if you've got it?\" asked Magano. \"Well, you must take care of yourself and eat lots of healthy food. Look at our food chart,\" she said. \"Who can remember what food is good for you?\" she asked.\n\nWhen Hilifa got home he told his mother what he had learned at school that day. \"Ms. Nelao told us about HIV and AIDS and how to look after someone who's ill. Magano and Hidipo are going to help me with my chores and we will do our homework together,\" he told her.\n\nThat afternoon Magano came and helped Hilifa to fetch water. Hidipo helped him to gather firewood. Then they sat and did their homework in the shade of the marula tree.\n\nMs. Nelao had also told Hilifa's neighbours that he was looking after his mother. They had promised to help him. Every night a different neighbour came with hot food for them to eat. Hilifa always gave them some vegetables from the garden.\n\nOn the last day of the school term Hilifa was very happy. He ran home to show his mother his report card. He ran into the yard calling, \"Mum. Mum. Look at my report card. I have got ‘A', ‘A', and more ‘A's'.\" Hilifa found his mother lying in bed. \"Mum!\" he called. \"Mum! Wake up!\" She didn't wake up.\n\nHilifa ran to the neighbours. \"My Mum. My Mum. She won't wake up,\" he cried. The neighbours went home with Hilifa and found Meme Ndapanda in her bed. \"She is dead, Hilifa,\" they said sadly.\n\nVery quickly the news spread that Meme Ndapanda was dead. The house was full of family, neighbours and friends. They prayed for Hilifa's mother and sang hymns. They talked about all the good things they knew about her.\n\nAunt Muzaa cooked for all the visitors. Uncle Kave told Hilifa that they would take him back to Oshakati after the funeral. His Grandfather told him stories about his mother when she was a little girl.\n\nAt the funeral Hilifa went to the front of the church and told everyone about his mother. \"My mother loved me and looked after me very well. She told me to study hard so that I could get a good job. She wanted me to be happy. I will study hard and work hard so that she can be proud of me.\"\n\nAfter the funeral Uncle Kave and Aunt Muzaa helped Hilifa to pack his things to take to Oshakati. \"Kunuu is looking forward to having a new friend,\" they told him. \"We will care for you like our own son.\" Hilifa said goodbye to the house and got into the taxi with them.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA\n\nText: Kandume Ruusa,

cousin Kunuu?","You kicked the ball into the tree and it got stuck on the thorns.","Your father got scratched getting it down for you.\"\n\n\"Look, there's an omandjembere bush.","Go and pick some to take home.\" When Hilifa was picking the sweet berries, she said, \"Do you remember when you were small you ate the berries and the seed inside.","You didn't go to the toilet for a week!\" \"Yes, my stomach was sooo sore,\" remembered Hilifa, laughing.","When they got home Hilifa's mother was very tired.","Hilifa made some tea.","Meme Ndapanda took a small box from under her bed.","\"Hilifa, this is for you.","In this box are things that will help you remember where you come from.\"\n\nShe took the mementos out of the box one by one.","\"This is a photo of your father holding you.","You were his firstborn son.","This photo is when I took you to see your grandparents, they were so happy.","This is the first tooth you lost.","Do you remember how you cried and I had to promise you that more would grow.","This is the brooch your father gave me when we were married for one year.\"\n\nHilifa held the box and began to cry.","His mother held him close by her side and said a prayer, \"May the Lord protect you and keep you safe.\" She held him as she spoke.","\"Hilifa, my son.","You know that I am very ill, and soon I will be with your father.","I don't want you to be sad.","Remember how much I love you.","Remember how much your father loved you.\"\n\nHis mother continued, \"Uncle Kave from Oshakati sends us money when he can.","He told me that he will care for you.","I have talked to him about it.","You'll go to school with Kunuu, his son.","Kunuu is in Grade 4 like you.","They will take good care of you.\" \"I like Uncle Kave and Aunt Muzaa,\" said Hilifa.","\"And I like playing with Kunuu.","Would you become well if they look after you?\" \"No, my son.","I won't become well.","You look after me very well.","I am proud to have such a good son.\"\n\nThe next morning at school Ms.","Nelao taught them about HIV and AIDS.","The learners looked afraid.","They heard about this illness on the radio, but no-one spoke about it at home.","\"Where does it come from?\" asked Magano.","\"How do we catch it?\" asked Hidipo.","Ms.","Nelao explained that HIV is the name of a virus.","When a person has the HIV virus in their blood they still look healthy.","\"We say they have AIDS when they become ill.\"\n\nMs.","Nelao explained some of the ways we can be infected with HIV.","\"If someone has HIV or AIDS we can catch the virus from their blood.","We should never share razors or toothbrushes.","If we get our ears pierced we must use sterilised blades and needles.\" She explained how needles and blades should be sterilised.","\"If we hurt ourselves and there is blood we must ask an adult to clean the wound.","We must cover the wound to protect it,\" she told them.","Then she showed them a chart.","\"These are all the ways you can't catch HIV,\" she told them.","\"You won't get HIV from using the toilet, or sharing a bath.","Hugging, kissing or shaking hands with someone with HIV or AIDS is also safe.","It's OK to share cups and plates with someone who has HIV or AIDS.","And you can't catch it from someone who is coughing or sneezing.","Also, you can't get it from mosquitoes or other biting insects like lice or bedbugs.\"\n\n\"What do you do if you've got it?\" asked Magano.","\"Well, you must take care of yourself and eat lots of healthy food.","Look at our food chart,\" she said.","\"Who can remember what food is good for you?\" she asked.","When Hilifa got home he told his mother what he had learned at school that day.","\"Ms.","Nelao told us about HIV and AIDS and how to look after someone who's ill.","Magano and Hidipo are going to help me with my chores and we will do our homework together,\" he told her.","That afternoon Magano came and helped Hilifa to fetch water.","Hidipo helped him to gather firewood.","Then they sat and did their homework in the shade of the marula tree.","Ms.","Nelao had also told Hilifa's neighbours that he was looking after his mother.","They had promised to help him.","Every night a different neighbour came with hot food for them to eat.","Hilifa always gave them some vegetables from the garden.","On the last day of the school term Hilifa was very happy.","He ran home to show his mother his report card.","He ran into the yard calling, \"Mum.","Mum.","Look at my report card.","I have got ‘A', ‘A', and more ‘A's'.\" Hilifa found his mother lying in bed.","\"Mum!\" he called.","\"Mum!","Wake up!\" She didn't wake up.","Hilifa ran to the neighbours.","\"My Mum.","My Mum.","She won't wake up,\" he cried.","The neighbours went home with Hilifa and found Meme Ndapanda in her bed.","\"She is dead, Hilifa,\" they said sadly.","Very quickly the news spread that Meme Ndapanda was dead.","The house was full of family, neighbours and friends.","They prayed for Hilifa's mother and sang hymns.","They talked about all the good things they knew about her.","Aunt Muzaa cooked for all the visitors.","Uncle Kave told Hilifa that they would take him back to Oshakati after the funeral.","His Grandfather told him stories about his mother when she was a little girl.","At the funeral Hilifa went to the front of the church and told everyone about his mother.","\"My mother loved me and looked after me very well.","She told me to study hard so that I could get a good job.","She wanted me to be happy.","I will study hard and work hard so that she can be proud of me.\"\n\nAfter the funeral Uncle Kave and Aunt Muzaa helped Hilifa to pack his things to take to Oshakati.","\"Kunuu is looking forward to having a new friend,\" they told him.","\"We will care for you like our own son.\" Hilifa said goodbye to the house and got into the taxi with them.","License: CC BY-NC-SA\n\nText: Kandume Ruusa, Sennobia-Charon Katjiuongua, Eliaser Nghitewa\n\nIllustration:

He likes going to town. Town is exciting! There are lots of things to see.\n\nRico holds his mother’s hand very tightly. Streams of people are passing by.\n\nThere are stalls selling beautiful handmade crafts.\n\nThere are small giraffes carved out of wood, chameleons and lizards made out of wire and coloured beads, and jewellery made from ostrich egg shell.\n\nThen he hears it! Someone is whistling the sweet melody of ‘Amazing Grace.’ He stops to listen. Where is it coming from?\n\n“I’ve never heard anyone whistle so beautifully before,” he thinks to himself.\n\nHe makes his way through the people. Then he sees the man who is whistling. People are putting coins into a small tin in front of him.\n\nBut ... something is wrong ...\n\nThe whistling man is not looking at the people. He is not looking at the money. He is not looking at anything. He’s searching for the coins in the tin and putting them into his pocket.\n\nRico stares at the whistling man and thinks, “Maybe he’s blind.”\n\nRico has never seen a blind person before. He feels scared. He grabs his mother’s dress and asks softly, “Mommy, is that man blind?”\n\nShe takes his hand. “Yes,” she answers, “yes, he’s blind. Look, he has a white stick. Many blind people carry a white stick. He uses this stick to feel for holes and other obstacles.”\n\n“But how did he come to town? How did he find his way through all the people?” Rico asks.\n\nHis mother tells him, “Maybe he has someone who helps him to find his way around. We call that person a guide.”\n\nThey walk to the zoopark. The traffic lights change to green, the cars stop and the pedestrians cross the street.\n\n“Look at the green light. When it is green we can see it is safe to cross the road. In some countries there is also a beeping sound,” Rico’s mother says. “When blind people hear the beeping, they know it is safe to cross the road.”\n\nThey sit on the green grass of the zoopark and watch the people walking by.\n\n“Some blind people have a guide dog,” his mother says. “These dogs are trained to guide their owner, but they are very expensive. There are very few guide dogs in Namibia.”\n\n“The blind man can’t watch TV,” Rico says.\n\n“He can hear the TV and radio,” Rico’s mother tells him. “Blind people can often hear things much better than people who can see.”\n\n“But he can’t read books or newspapers,” says Rico.\n\n“There are books written in Braille. Instead of words printed with ink, there are raised dots which make letters. It’s like a code.”\n\n“How can he read if he can’t see?”\n\n“He reads with his hands. He feels the raised dots with his fingers, just like you see the letters with your eyes.”\n\nRico is amazed to think that people who are blind can do everyday things; things like walking around in town, like whistling songs, like reading.\n\nHis mother tells him, “The only difference between you and a blind person is that you can see and a blind person can’t see.”\n\n“I can see, but I can’t
