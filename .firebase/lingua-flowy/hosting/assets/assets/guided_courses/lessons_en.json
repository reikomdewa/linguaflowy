[{"id": "yt_hJP5GqnTrNo", "userId": "system", "title": "How AI Could Save (Not Destroy) Education | Sal Khan | TED", "language": "en", "content": "So anyone who's been paying attention for the last few months has been seeing headlines like this, especially in education. The thesis has been: students are going to be using ChatGPT and other forms of AI to cheat, do their assignments. They’re not going to learn. And it’s going to completely undermine education as we know it. Now, what I'm going to argue today is not only are there ways to mitigate all of that, if we put the right guardrails, we do the right things, we can mitigate it. But I think we're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen. And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor. And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing, artificially intelligent teaching assistant. And just to appreciate how big of a deal it would be to give everyone a personal tutor, I show you this clip from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study, or he called it the “2 sigma problem.” The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation, sigma, the symbol for standard deviation. And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution, that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out, that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students, then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right. It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks, like, that right distribution, a two standard-deviation improvement. Just to put that in plain language, that could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student. It can take your below-average student and turn them into an above-average student. Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said, well, this is all good, but how do you actually scale group instruction this way? How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way? What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that. Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way at Khan Academy for over a decade now, but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically. I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI, which we call Khanmigo, what it can now do and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going. So this right over here is a traditional exercise that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy. But what's new is that little bot thing at the right. And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards, which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher. It’s moderated actually by a second AI. And also it does not tell you the answer. It is not a cheating tool. When the student says, \"Tell me the answer,\" it says, \"I'm your tutor. What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?\" Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people who think large language models are not good at mathematics, notice, not only does it notice the mistake, it asks the student to explain their reasoning, but it's actually doing what I would say, not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do. It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind, that they probably didn’t use the distributive property. Remember, we need to distribute the negative two to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses. This to me is a very, very, very big deal. And it's not just in math. This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy, where the student needs to make the clouds part. And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus. It only made the left cloud part. But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on? Why is only the left cloud moving? And it understands the code. It knows all the context of what the student is doing, and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds, which I think is kind of mind-blowing. And it says, \"To make the right cloud move as well, try adding a line of code inside the draw function that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame.\" Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers. We've all been trying to teach the world to code, but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there. And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my kids, when they're learning to code, I can't help them this well, this fast, this is really going to be a super tutor. And it's not just exercises. It understands what you're watching. It understands the context of your video. It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?” And it asks Socratically, \"Well, what do you care about?\" And let's say the student says, \"I want to be a professional athlete.\" And it says, \"Well, learning about the size of cells, which is what this video is, that could be really useful for understanding nutrition and how your body works, etc.\" It can answer questions, it can quiz you, it can connect it to other ideas, you can now ask as many questions of a video as you could ever dream of. (Applause) Another big shortage out there, I remember the high school I went to, the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one. A lot of the country, it's worse than that. We can use Khanmigo to give every student a guidance counselor, academic coach, career coach, life coach, which is exactly what you see right over here. And we launched this with the GPT-4 launch. We have a few thousand people on this. This isn't a fake demo, this is really it in action. And then there is, you know, things that I think it would have been even harder, it would have been a little science fiction to do with even a traditional tutor. We run an online high school with Arizona State University called Khan World School, and we have a student who attends that online school, based in India. Her name's Saanvi. And she was doing a report on \"The Great Gatsby.\" And when she was reading \"The Great Gatsby,\" Jay Gatsby keeps looking at the green light off into the distance. And she's like, \"Why does he do that?\" She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this and commented about the symbolism of that, but none of it was really resonating with her. And then she realized that she had Khanmigo and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself. And so, \"Ah, splendid choice, old sport. I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.” And so, \"Why do you keep staring at the green light?\" \"Ah, the green light, old sport. It's a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see. It's situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock across the bay from my mansion. I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life.\" And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,” she called him “Mr. Gatsby,” and at the end she actually apologized for taking his time, which I thought was very polite of her. But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ... You could talk to historical figures. We're even probably going to add an activity you can talk to like, the Mississippi River. It brings things to life in ways that really were science fiction even six months or a year ago. Students can get into debates with the AI. And we’ve got this here is the student debating whether we should cancel student debt. The student is against canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback. We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have, Khan Lab School. The students, the high school students especially, they're saying \"This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment. It makes me that much more confident to go into the classroom and really participate.\" And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn, but frankly, it's not out there for most students. But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone. A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been, \"It's going to do the writing for kids. Kids are not going to learn to write.\" But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you. So this is a little thing, and my eight year old is addicted to this, and he's not a kid that really liked writing before, but you can say, “I want to write a horror story,” and it says, \"Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling. Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows and chilling mysteries.\" And this is an activity where the student will write two sentences, and then the AI will write two sentences. And so they collaborate together on a story. The student writes, \"Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost. She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident.\" And the AI says, \"Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship. One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion,\" etc. I encourage you all to hopefully one day try this. This is surprisingly fun. Now to even more directly hit this use case. And what I'm about to show you, everything I showed you so far is actually already part of Khanmigo, and what I’m about to show you, we haven't shown to anyone yet, this is a prototype. We hope to be able to launch it in the next few months, but this is to directly use AI, use generative AI, to not undermine English and language arts but to actually enhance it in ways that we couldn't have even conceived of even a year ago. This is reading comprehension. The students reading Steve Jobs's famous speech at Stanford. And then as they get to certain points, they can click on that little question. And the AI will then Socratically, almost like an oral exam, ask the student about things. And the AI can highlight parts of the passage. Why did the author use that word? What was their intent? Does it back up their argument? They can start to do stuff that once again, we never had the capability to give everyone a tutor, everyone a writing coach to actually dig in to reading at this level. And you could go on the other side of it. And we have whole work flows that helps them write, helps them be a writing coach, draw an outline. But once a student actually constructs a draft, and this is where they're constructing a draft, they can ask for feedback once again, as you would expect from a good writing coach. In this case, the student will say, let's say, \"Does my evidence support my claim?\" And then the AI, not only is able to give feedback, but it's able to highlight certain parts of the passage and says, \"On this passage, this doesn't quite support your claim,\" but once again, Socratically says, \"Can you tell us why?\" So it's pulling the student, making them a better writer, giving them far more feedback than they've ever been able to actually get before. And we think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it. Now, everything I've talked about so far is for the student. But we think this could be equally as powerful for the teacher to drive more personalized education and frankly save time and energy for themselves and for their students. So this is an American history exercise on Khan Academy. It's a question about the Spanish-American War. And at first it's in student mode. And if you say, “Tell me the answer,” it’s not going to tell the answer. It's going to go into tutoring mode. But that little toggle which teachers have access to, they can turn student mode off and then it goes into teacher mode. And what this does is it turns into -- You could view it as a teacher's guide on steroids. Not only can it explain the answer, it can explain how you might want to teach it. It can help prepare the teacher for that material. It can help them create lesson plans, as you could see doing right there. It'll eventually help them create progress reports and help them, eventually, grade. So once again, teachers spend about half their time with this type of activity, lesson planning. All of that energy can go back to them or go back to human interactions with their actual students. (Applause) So, you know, one point I want to make. These large language models are so powerful, there's a temptation to say like, well, all these people are just going to slap them onto their websites, and it kind of turns the applications themselves into commodities. And what I've got to tell you is that’s one of the reasons why I didn’t sleep for two weeks when I first had access to GPT-4 back in August. But we quickly realized that to actually make it magical, I think what you saw with Khanmigo a little bit, it didn't interact with you the way that you see ChatGPT interacting. It was a little bit more magical, it was more Socratic, it was clearly much better at math than what most people are used to thinking. And the reason is, there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen. And I could go through the whole list of everything we've been working on, many, many people for over six, seven months to make it feel magical. But perhaps the most intellectually interesting one is we realized, and this was an idea from an OpenAI researcher, that we could dramatically improve its ability in math and its ability in tutoring if we allow the AI to think before it speaks. So if you're tutoring someone and you immediately just start talking before you assess their math, you might not get it right. But if you construct thoughts for yourself, and what you see on the right there is an actual AI thought, something that it generates for itself but it does not share with the student. then its accuracy went up dramatically, and its ability to be a world-class tutor went up dramatically. And you can see it's talking to itself here. It says, \"The student got a different answer than I did, but do not tell them they made a mistake. Instead, ask them to explain how they got to that step.\" So I'll just finish off, hopefully, you know, what I’ve just shown you is just half of what we are working on, and we think this is just the very tip of the iceberg of where this can actually go. And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't have been even a year ago, that we together have a chance of addressing the 2 sigma problem and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity, dramatically accelerating education as we know it. Now, just to take a step back at a meta level, obviously we heard a lot today, the debates on either side. There's folks who take a more pessimistic view of AI, they say this is scary, there's all these dystopian scenarios, we maybe want to slow down, we want to pause. On the other side, there are the more optimistic folks that say, well, we've gone through inflection points before, we've gone through the Industrial Revolution. It was scary, but it all kind of worked out. And what I'd argue right now is I don't think this is like a flip of a coin or this is something where we'll just have to, like, wait and see which way it turns out. I think everyone here and beyond, we are active participants in this decision. I'm pretty convinced that the first line of reasoning is actually almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, that if we act with fear and if we say, \"Hey, we've just got to stop doing this stuff,\" what's really going to happen is the rule followers might pause, might slow down, but the rule breakers, as Alexandr [Wang] mentioned, the totalitarian governments, the criminal organizations, they're only going to accelerate. And that leads to what I am pretty convinced is the dystopian state, which is the good actors have worse AIs than the bad actors. But I'll also, you know, talk to the optimists a little bit. I don't think that means that, oh, yeah, then we should just relax and just hope for the best. That might not happen either. I think all of us together have to fight like hell to make sure that we put the guardrails, we put in -- when the problems arise -- reasonable regulations. But we fight like hell for the positive use cases. Because very close to my heart, and obviously there's many potential positive use cases, but perhaps the most powerful use case and perhaps the most poetic use case is if AI, artificial intelligence, can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. Thank you.

Shannon Odell", "language": "en", "content": "What is the smartest age? Perhaps a day of friendly competition will lead us to the answer. Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash— ten teams of two competing in a decathlon of mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles. I’ve been training all year. I’ll need to pick the smartest, most capable teammate. I’ve narrowed down the roster. First we have Gabriela. She may only be 8, but don’t underestimate her! She’s fluent in two languages and is the ultimate outside-the-box thinker. Then there’s Ama. She can recite 100 digits of pi, designs satellites for a living, and bakes a perfect soufflé. Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He’s the best chess player in the neighborhood, not to mention he’s competed in over 20 Brain Clashes and is a five-time champion! I’m not sure who to pick! Who’s the smartest? Which of these teammates should Amir choose for tomorrow's contest and why? Of course, it depends. While intelligence is often associated with things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture the scope and depth of a person’s varied abilities. So instead, we’ll break down the idea of “smart” into categories like creativity, memory, and learning and explore when the brain’s best at each of them. Let's start at the very beginning. In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible rapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural connections are formed every second. As the brain develops, it goes through a pruning process. Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened and unused connections are removed. Frequently used neuronal pathways are myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, allowing information to travel faster. This creates a more efficient, fine-tuned brain. But this brain remodeling happens within and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills to flourish at different ages. For example, in childhood, brain regions involved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can learn and master multiple languages. Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop. As a result, some young children may struggle with strategic games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, planning, and abstract thought. At the same time, children tend to be more flexible, exploration-based learners. They often use more creative approaches when finding solutions to riddles and are, on average, less afraid to make mistakes. But adults have their own unique set of abilities. Adults benefit from a well-developed prefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills that require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient puzzle solvers or crossword masters. Late in adulthood, these same skills may decline as the brain’s memory center, known as the hippocampus, shrinks. But there’s a reason for the phrase “older and wiser.” After a lifetime of learning, older adults have more knowledge to recall and utilize, making them excellent trivia partners. Other factors that Amir should consider are his own strengths. As an adolescent, the prefrontal cortical regions of your brain are more developed than in childhood. This allows you to better navigate logic and math puzzles. Simultaneously, deep inside the brain, regions that are important in motivation and reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers like Amir to be curious and adventurous learners. In many ways, you can think of the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains wired to seek out new experiences  and learn quickly.

How are you? (Audience) Good. It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter) If you work in education, you're not asked. (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God. Why me?\" (Laughter) \"My one night out all week.\" (Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) That was it, by the way. Thank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) \"Well, I was born ... \" (Laughter) I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will in a minute.\" (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it. (Laughter) \"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, \"You OK with that?\" They said, \"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\" (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was. (Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) \"Must try harder.\" (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\" To William Shakespeare. \"And put the pencil down!\" (Laughter) \"And stop speaking like that.\" (Laughter) \"It's confusing everybody.\" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. (Laughter) But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities. At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education as an alien and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors. In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings. (Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night. (Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat. (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it. (Laughter) Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? \"Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.\" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ... thankfully. (Laughter) No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.\" (Laughter) \"Give me a break.\" (Laughter) Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, \"If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?\" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\" (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day. I said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian has a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that. (Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said, \"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back. We won't be very long,\" and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, \"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\" I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. (Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years, all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much. (Applause)", "sentences": ["Good morning.", "How are you?", "(Audience) Good.", "It's been great, hasn't it?", "I've been blown away by the whole thing.", "In fact, I'm leaving.", "(Laughter) There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about.", "One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it.", "The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future.", "No idea how this may play out.", "I have an interest in education.", "Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education.", "Don't you?", "I find this very interesting.", "If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.", "(Laughter) If you work in education, you're not asked.", "(Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously.", "That's strange to me.", "But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face.", "They're like, \"Oh my God.", "Why me?\" (Laughter) \"My one night out all week.\" (Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right?", "Like religion and money and other things.", "So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.", "We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp.", "If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065.", "Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time.", "And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it.", "So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.", "And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation.", "I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she?", "Just seeing what she could do.", "And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood.", "What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent.", "And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.", "So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity.", "My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.", "(Applause) Thank you.", "(Applause) That was it, by the way.", "Thank you very much.", "(Laughter) So, 15 minutes left.", "(Laughter) \"Well, I was born ...", "\" (Laughter) I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.", "She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did.", "The teacher was fascinated.", "She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will in a minute.\" (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.", "(Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.", "He was in the Nativity play.", "Do you remember the story?", "(Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story.", "Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.", "(Laughter) \"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about.", "We considered this to be one of the lead parts.", "We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in?", "They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh.", "This really happened.", "We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, \"You OK with that?\" They said, \"Yeah, why?", "Was that wrong?\" They just switched.", "The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads.", "They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\" (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.", "If they don't know, they'll have a go.", "Am I right?", "They're not frightened of being wrong.", "I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.", "What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong.", "And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.", "They have become frightened of being wrong.", "And we run our companies like this.", "We stigmatize mistakes.", "And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make.", "And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.", "Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.", "The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.", "I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it.", "Or rather, we get educated out of it.", "So why is this?", "I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.", "In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.", "So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was.", "(Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born.", "Are you struck by a new thought?", "I was.", "You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?", "Do you?", "Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?", "Shakespeare being seven?", "I never thought of it.", "I mean, he was seven at some point.", "He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?", "(Laughter) How annoying would that be?", "(Laughter) \"Must try harder.\" (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\" To William Shakespeare.", "\"And put the pencil down!\" (Laughter) \"And stop speaking like that.\" (Laughter) \"It's confusing everybody.\" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition.", "Actually, my son didn't want to come.", "I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.", "He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.", "He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England.", "This was the love of his life, Sarah.", "He'd known her for a month.", "(Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16.", "He was really upset on the plane.", "He said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.", "(Laughter) But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.", "Every one.", "Doesn't matter where you go.", "You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't.", "At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities.", "At the bottom are the arts.", "Everywhere on earth.", "And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts.", "Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance.", "There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics.", "Why?", "Why not?", "I think this is rather important.", "I think math is very important, but so is dance.", "Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do.", "We all have bodies, don't we?", "Did I miss a meeting?", "(Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up.", "And then we focus on their heads.", "And slightly to one side.", "If you were to visit education as an alien and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors.", "Isn't it?", "They're the people who come out the top.", "And I used to be one, so there.", "(Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement.", "They're just a form of life.", "Another form of life.", "But they're rather curious.", "And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors.", "In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads.", "They live up there and slightly to one side.", "They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.", "They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.", "(Laughter) Don't they?", "It's a way of getting their head to meetings.", "(Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night.", "(Laughter) And there, you will see it.", "Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.", "(Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it.", "(Laughter) Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability.", "And there's a reason.", "Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century.", "They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism.", "So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.", "Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top.", "So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that.", "Is that right?", "\"Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.\" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.", "The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.", "And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image.", "If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance.", "And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized.", "And I think we can't afford to go on that way.", "In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history.", "More people.", "And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.", "Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.", "Isn't that true?", "When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.", "If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one.", "And I didn't want one, frankly.", "(Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other.", "It's a process of academic inflation.", "And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet.", "We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.", "We know three things about intelligence.", "One, it's diverse.", "We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it.", "We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically.", "We think in abstract terms, we think in movement.", "Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.", "If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive.", "The brain isn't divided into compartments.", "In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.", "By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum.", "It's thicker in women.", "Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking.", "Because you are, aren't you?", "There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life.", "If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ...", "thankfully.", "(Laughter) No, she's good at some things.", "But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here.", "If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed.", "I say, \"Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.\" (Laughter) \"Give me a break.\" (Laughter) Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, \"If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?\" Remember that old chestnut?", "I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\" (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct.", "I'm doing a new book at the moment called \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent.", "I'm fascinated by how people got to be there.", "It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.", "Have you heard of her?", "Some have.", "She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work.", "She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful.", "I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see.", "(Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day.", "I said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting.", "When she was at school, she was really hopeless.", "And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian has a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting.", "I think now they'd say she had ADHD.", "Wouldn't you?", "But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point.", "It wasn't an available condition.", "(Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that.", "(Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist.", "So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always

But you still have no idea what these characters mean. This scenario isn’t just a bizarre misunderstanding— it’s a valuable thought experiment for understanding artificial intelligence. Philosopher John Searle developed the original version of this premise in 1980, as a response to some of the AI work being done at the time. But while modern AI models don't work like those outdated machines or the prisoner in Searle’s hypothetical, the question motivating his thought experiment is still relevant. To quote Searle, he wanted to interrogate whether an “appropriately programmed computer literally has cognitive states.” In other words, if a computer looks like it understands something, does that mean it actually understands the way a human does? Searle’s question falls into a long tradition of exploring whether or not AI could have a mind like ours. But answering these inquiries is incredibly difficult because, as philosophers and cognitive scientists will tell you, we still don’t know how our minds work. Even our fundamental definitions are slippery! Theorists generally agree that concepts like understanding, sentience, and consciousness are all different, but also that they’re related, and we don’t know how. Worse still, our usual scientific tools struggle to help us understand these experiences. Consider drinking a cup of coffee. Scientists can observe the physical process of ingesting the coffee, and we can measure the chemical impacts of caffeine on your body. These things are objective realities. But your collective sensation of smelling, sipping, evaluating, and experiencing a morning routine is more than the sum of its parts. This is consciousness— your subjective experience of being alive. And despite major leaps in psychology, cognitive science, and neurology, researchers still don’t know how various firing neurons bring about this experience. So if we can't define consciousness and understanding or identify what's uniquely human about them, how can we possibly test for these states in computers? Assessments like the Turing Test propose that if a human can't tell they're conversing with a computer, that computer could be seen as having some internal cognition. But this scenario is exactly what Searle was criticizing! This computer might just have the appearance of understanding. And just like cognitive scientists struggling to map consciousness onto brain activity, today’s AI researchers know how they trained their creations, but not how AIs reach their exact conclusions. There are some ways in which modern machine learning models are less mysterious than their predecessors. Approaches like neural networks and deep learning are designed to mimic known elements of human cognition. Like us, these models excel at pattern recognition— they learn by becoming familiar with information and forming connections across data sets. This kind of processing arguably approaches Searle’s definition of understanding— but it also reveals a bias in his original question. Since humans learn through pattern recognition and we believe ourselves to be conscious, we might also be predisposed to think other beings who learn the same way are somehow closer to consciousness as well. To combat this bias, some theorists have developed a different metric; specifically, that a fully conscious AI could draw connections beyond the information in its data set. For example, one lab’s “artificial consciousness test” probes AIs that have no data about consciousness for information they could only acquire from being conscious. This might involve asking an AI if it understands dreaming, or can report having had dreams itself. Can it understand a story about body swapping, where consciousnesses are shuffled between physical forms? It’s unclear when or if an AI will be able to understand us the way we understand each other.

Rachel Marie E. Salas", "language": "en", "content": "In the 1970s, psychoanalyst Samuel Dunkell proposed a curious, albeit almost completely unsubstantiated, theory that the position you sleep in reflects your personality. For example, preferring to snooze in the so-called royal position indicated self-confidence, while sleeping semi-fetal meant you’re sensible and well adjusted. While Dunkell’s ideas lack any definitive proof, how we sleep can impact our health. So, what’s the best position to sleep in? Sleep positions go by countless creative names— the zombie, mountain climber, free faller, and soldier— yet sleep experts typically simplify them into four basic types: left side, right side, stomach, or back. Until the age of one, it is recommended that babies sleep on their backs to lower their risk of choking and suffocation. As young children, we start to move around more in our sleep, usually ending up on our sides and backs. And this tendency to avoid sleeping on our stomachs only grows with age. By adulthood, most people prefer side-sleeping, while fewer favor back-sleeping, and stomach-sleeping is the least preferred overall. But of course, individual sleep styles are highly personal: some people are sworn belly sleepers, while others can't nod off unless they're sprawled out on their backs. How we spend the night affects our bodies in several ways. Different sleep postures shift the relative positions of our internal organs, which can either relieve or worsen certain health issues. Others can leave the spine unsupported, straining nearby tissue, and preventing the muscles in the back, hips, or neck from fully relaxing. This can then lead to tension and stiffness in the morning. Take, for example, the least popular position: sleeping prone. Of the four, this also tends to be the least recommended by sleep experts, as it's thought to stretch the natural curvature of your spine. Yet there are unique situations when lying on your stomach may be beneficial. For patients with certain respiratory conditions, for example, it allows the back of the lungs to expand more freely. Sleeping on your back, on the other hand, is often preferred by those with lower back pain. When paired with a small pillow under the knees, this position allows the spine to maintain its natural curve. However, it may be less than ideal for your sleep partner. For some people, lying on their back can cause the soft tissues of the throat and tongue to collapse into the airway. Then, as the body tries to pull air through, these tissues vibrate, creating the sound we call snoring. This is also why people with sleep apnea are often told to avoid this position. This condition already involves pauses in breathing, and back sleeping can increase the likelihood that the airway collapses completely, blocking airflow. Today, most experts generally recommend side-sleeping, particularly when combined with a pillow between the knees, to better align the spine. But as it turns out, which side you lie on may make a difference. For example, studies show that sleeping on the left side often reduces heartburn symptoms for those with acid reflux. Your stomach is primarily located on the left side of your body, so this position situates it below the esophagus, allowing gravity to naturally keep stomach acid from flowing back up. However, for people with congestive heart failure, who often have an enlarged left ventricle, sleeping on the right side can help relieve chest pressure and improve their overall quality of sleep. Clearly, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. And attempting to reap the benefits of any one position can be tough, since most people shift positions 20 to 30 times per night without even knowing it. Pillows and other sleep training devices can help you stay in one place. But fortunately, unless you have a specific concern, sleep movement isn't always a bad thing. It's how your body naturally relieves pressure, responds to discomfort, and ultimately prevents injury. So, the next time you find yourself drifting to the free faller, soldier, or zombie, you can rest assured.", "sentences": ["In the 1970s, psychoanalyst Samuel Dunkell proposed a curious, albeit almost
