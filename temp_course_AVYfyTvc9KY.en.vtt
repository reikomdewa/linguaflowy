00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.920
Hi everybody.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.960
Welcome to Beginner 1.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.960
In these videos, I hope to teach you some
basic English.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.780
So these videos are for low level beginners.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.110
Okay…

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.160
Now when you watch these videos, I want you
to pay attention.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.180
Okay…

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.220
Watch all the videos in the series.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.220
Okay…

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.539
Please listen carefully and if there are any
words or expressions that you don’t know,

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.090
please check your dictionary.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.020
Another thing you should do is repeat after
me.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.060
Repeating is a really good practice.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.060
Okay…

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.280
So, I know that some of these videos are hard.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.800
But please don’t give up.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.290
If you try your best, and watch all of these
videos, I know that your English will get

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.290
better.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.830
Okay, well let’s get started.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.780
Hi, everybody and welcome to this video.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.810
Now in this video, I want to talk about the
difference between consonants and vowels.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.510
Now, in the English alphabet, there are twenty-six
letters.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:22.360
And in the alphabet, there are five main vowels
and one special vowel.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.360
And the rest are consonants.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.360
So, let’s look at the board.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.110
Here’s the alphabet.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.160
The first letter, ‘a’, is a vowel.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.640
The next letter, ‘b’, is a consonant.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.290
‘c’ is a consonant.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.260
‘d’: consonant.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.210
‘e’ is a vowel.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.170
Then, ‘f’, is a consonant.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.470
‘g’: consonant.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.770
‘h’: consonant.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.360
‘e’ is another vowel.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.960
‘j’ is a consonant.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.360
‘k’: consonant.
‘l’, ‘m’, ‘n’ are consonants.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.959
‘o’ is another vowel.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:27.020
‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, ’s’ and ‘t’,
these are all consonants.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.099
‘u’ is the last main vowel.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.970
‘v’: consonant.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.840
‘w’: consonant.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.709
‘x’: consonant.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.190
‘y’ is the special vowel.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.980
And we’ll talk about that more later on.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.770
And ‘z’ is the last letter and it is a
consonant.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.230
Okay, so, there are twenty-six letters in
the alphabet.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.740
There are five main vowels.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.410
One special vowel.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.319
And the rest are consonant.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.620
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.620
Okay…

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.150
Let’s look at some words.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.960
Now all English words have vowels.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.200
Maybe one or many vowels.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.230
So, let’s look at these words.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.160
The first word is “cat”.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.250
Okay, we have ‘c’ is a consonant.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.020
‘a’ a vowel.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.459
‘t’: consonant.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.459
“Egg”.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.069
‘e’ is a vowel.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.099
And ‘g’, ‘g’.
‘g’ is a consonant.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.099
“Hit”.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.060
‘h’ is a consonant.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.060
‘i’ a vowel.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.000
And ‘t’ a consonant.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.050
“Top”.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.260
‘t’ is a consonant.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.300
‘o’ is a vowel.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.160
And ‘p’ a consonant.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.140
The last word is “cut”.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.110
‘c’ is a consonant.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.560
‘u’ a vowel.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.980
And ‘t’ a consonant.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.310
So we have the main vowels: ‘a’, ’e
’,’i’ ,’o’ ,’u’.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.670
Now, I said ‘y’ is a special vowel.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.829
That’s because sometimes it’s a vowel
and sometimes it’s a consonant.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.560
So let’s look.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.830
In the word, “why”, the letter ‘y’
sounds like ‘i’.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.180
“Why”.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.240
So it is a vowel.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
“Bicycle”.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.690
The letter ‘y’ sounds like ‘i’.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.010
“Bicycle”.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.820
‘i’ is the letter ‘i’ right, it sounds
like the letter ‘i’.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.900
So, in this case ‘y’ is also a vowel.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.900
“Pretty”.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.900
“Pretty”.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.699
‘y’ sounds like ‘e’.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:54.699
Okay…

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:55.699
“Pretty”.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.020
So, it’s a vowel.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:07.240
Now, in the last two words, “you” and
“yes”, the letter ‘y’ is a consonant.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.710
Usually, if ‘y’ comes at the beginning
of a word, or if it makes a /u/ sound, for

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.810
example, “you”, “yes”, it is a consonant.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.060
Okay…

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.080
So again, five main vowels: ‘a’, ’e’,
’i’, ’o’, ’u’.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.330
And ‘y’ the special vowel.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:39.860
Now to help us remember vowels, we can say,
“a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y.”

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.730
Okay, repeat again after me.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.669
“a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y.”

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.259
One more time, faster.

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.520
“a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y.”

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.400
Okay, and that’s the end of this video.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.889
Thank you.

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.630
Hi everybody and welcome to this video.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.320
In this video, we’re going to talk about
using ‘a’ or ‘an’.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.350
Okay…

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.970
We use ‘a’ or ‘an’ in front of nouns.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.199
Well, what is a noun?

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:20.330
A noun is a person, place, thing or animal.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.810
Okay, so let’s look at the board.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.970
The first noun we have is “banana”.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.330
“Banana”, starts with the consonant ‘b’.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
So we put “a banana”.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.419
“a banana”.

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.280
Look at the next word.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.389
“Apple”.

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.230
In this case, the first letter is ‘a’.
‘a’ is a vowel.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:53.550
Remember the vowels are a, e, i, o, u, so
we have to put ‘an’.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.930
“an apple”.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.120
“cat”.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.319
Hmmm.

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.800
The first letter, ‘c’, is a consonant.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.340
So, should we put, ‘a’ or ‘an’?

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.020
Remember, if it’s a consonant, we have to
put ‘a’.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.710
“a cat”.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.419
The next word, “boy”.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:20.160
Again, the word starts with a consonant: ‘b’.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.520
So we have to say, “a boy”.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.240
The next word, “egg”, has the letter ‘e’
in front.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.740
‘e’ is a vowel.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.479
So what do we put?

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:34.690
We put ‘an’.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.200
If we read it, it sounds like “an egg.”

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.710
“an egg”.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.030
Okay, and the last word is “ant”.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.479
“ant” starts with the vowel ‘a’.

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.110
So again, we must put……”an ant”.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.650
“an ant”.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.479
Now, let’s go through these words together.

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:57.599
“a banana”.

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.710
“a banana”.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.830
“an apple”.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.940
“an apple”.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:11.789
Keep in mind that when you have ‘an’ in
front, it has to sound like almost one word.

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:13.260
“an apple”.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.740
“an apple”.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.210
“a cat”.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.680
“a cat”.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.150
“a boy”.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.630
“a boy”.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.099
“an egg”.

00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:23.570
“an egg”.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.050
“an egg”.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.520
“an egg”.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.990
“an ant”.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.460
“an ant”.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.940
“an ant”.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.940
Okay…

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.459
Let’s move on the next part.

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:37.389
Okay, let’s do some extra practice.

00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:40.759
Ahhh, I have some nouns on the board.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:46.660
Remember, a noun is a person, place, thing
or animal.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.699
So let’s go through them one by one.

00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:51.989
“A book”, “book” is a thing.

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:54.899
It’s a thing that we read.

00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:56.440
“Park”, is a place.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.619
It’s a place we go.

00:08:58.619 --> 00:09:00.350
“Umbrella” is a thing.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.350
Right…

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.269
Umbrella is a thing that we use when it’s
raining.

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:05.269
“Elephant”.

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:07.709
“Elephant” is an animal.

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:08.709
“Doctor”.

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:11.899
“Doctor” is a person.

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:13.600
And “orange”.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.079
Orange is a thing that we eat.

00:09:15.079 --> 00:09:16.079
Okay…

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:20.769
Now, I’m going to say ‘a’ or ‘an’
in front of the nouns.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:24.730
I want you to listen and see if you can hear
the difference.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.769
Okay…

00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:26.769
We have “book”.

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:30.939
In that case we say, “a book”.

00:09:30.939 --> 00:09:32.819
“a book”.

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:35.869
We have to say, “a book”.

00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:36.869
Okay…

00:09:36.869 --> 00:09:39.949
The next one is “park”.

00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:42.329
We say, “a park”.

00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:43.910
“a park”.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:49.620
Remember, we put ‘a’ in front of words
that begin with consonants.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.869
‘b’ and ‘p’ are consonants.

00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:55.449
That’s why we say, “a book”, “a park”.

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:56.449
Okay…

00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:58.759
How about the next word?

00:09:58.759 --> 00:09:59.970
“an umbrella”.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.179
“an umbrella”.

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:03.939
Could you here the difference?

00:10:03.939 --> 00:10:05.319
“an umbrella”.

00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:11.600
We say ‘an’ because umbrella starts with
a vowel: ‘u’.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.199
“an umbrella”.

00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:14.790
Okay…
“elephant”.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.629
We should we say?

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:17.629
“elephant”.

00:10:17.629 --> 00:10:18.629
“elephant”.

00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:22.619
Again, elephant starts with a vowel.

00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:25.379
“a doctor”.

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:28.129
“a doctor”.

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:30.889
“a doctor”.

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:34.339
And the last word, “an orange”.

00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:36.110
“an orange”.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:41.240
Again, we have to say, “an orange” because
‘o’ is a vowel.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.309
So, let’s go through each word one more
time.

00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:47.279
“a book”.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.259
“a book”.

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:52.220
Okay…
“a park”.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.189
“a park”.

00:10:54.189 --> 00:10:56.160
“an umbrella”.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.139
“an umbrella”.

00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:00.959
Notice it sounds like one word.

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.049
“an umbrella”.

00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:05.139
“an elephant”.

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:07.230
“an elephant”.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.319
“a doctor”.

00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:11.410
“a doctor”.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.809
And the last one.

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:14.529
“an orange”.

00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:16.249
“an orange”.

00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:17.249
Okay…

00:11:17.249 --> 00:11:19.110
So that’s the end of this video.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.110
I hope you can remember when to use ‘a’
and ‘an’.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.519
Okay, thank you.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.660
Bye.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.389
Hi, everybody and welcome to this video.

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:37.120
Now, in this lesson I’m going to talk about
singular and plural nouns.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120
Okay…

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.660
Singular means one.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.470
And plural means more than one or many.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.470
Okay…

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.220
So let’s look at the board.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.529
This part is showing singular nouns.

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:54.370
Okay, remember, singular means one.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.370
Okay…

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.639
So when the noun is singular, we put ‘a’
or ‘an’.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.619
So let’s look.

00:12:01.619 --> 00:12:02.939
“a ring”.

00:12:02.939 --> 00:12:04.660
That means one ring.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.459
“a ring”.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.259
“a dog”.

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:10.249
Again, one dog.

00:12:10.249 --> 00:12:12.069
“a dog”.

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:13.899
“a teacher”.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:14.949
One teacher.

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:17.049
“a teacher”.

00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:19.160
“an apple”.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.269
“an apple”.

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:22.529
One apple.

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:24.480
“an egg”.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.429
“an egg”.

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:27.679
One egg.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:31.829
So again, one….noun is singular.

00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:33.189
Okay…

00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:37.279
Now over here, we have plural nouns.

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:39.079
Plural means more than one.

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:42.540
Two, three, four, and so on.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.800
So, many.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
Okay…

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:51.090
So, when we have a plural noun we have to,
don’t forget, we have to put ‘s’ or

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.090
‘es’.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:58.410
Again, if there’s more than one, if the
noun is plural, you have to put ‘s’ or

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.819
‘es’.

00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:03.820
Now the nouns here, you just have to add an
‘s’.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.339
Okay, and we’re going to go through them
right now.

00:13:07.339 --> 00:13:09.360
“two rings”.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.649
Okay, we had one ring.

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:12.649
“a ring”.

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:14.749
Now we have “two rings.”

00:13:14.749 --> 00:13:16.850
With an ‘s’.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:17.850
Okay…

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.980
We had “a dog”.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.509
The plural is “three dogs”.

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:24.399
Again, ‘s’.

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:26.290
“three dogs”.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.170
“a teacher”.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.059
One teacher.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.949
“four teachers”.

00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:33.829
“four teachers”.

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:35.540
Don’t forget the ‘s’.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.910
Okay, you must not forget that.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.410
“an apple”.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.160
That’s one apple.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.449
Then we have plural.

00:13:42.449 --> 00:13:44.350
“five apples”.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.249
“five apples”.

00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:47.249
Okay…

00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:48.389
And the last one.

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:49.810
“an egg”.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.220
One egg.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.639
“six eggs”.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:54.300
Don’t forget ‘s’.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.470
“six eggs”.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.470
Okay…

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.889
I really need you to remember that.

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:00.970
“two rings”.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.049
“three dogs”.

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:05.129
“four teachers”.

00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:07.209
“five apples”.

00:14:07.209 --> 00:14:08.699
and “six eggs”.

00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:11.949
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:15.480
Okay, now we have some more nouns.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.600
These nouns are a little bit different.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.230
Uhhh, when they’re singular it’s the same.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.179
You put ‘a’ or ‘an’ in front.

00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:28.089
But when you want to make them plural, you
have to add ‘es’.

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:35.329
Remember, I said, you can add ‘s’ or ‘es’
to make a noun plural…more than one.

00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:39.119
So again, these nouns you have to add ‘es’.

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:41.459
So let’s go through them one more time.

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:42.459
Okay…

00:14:42.459 --> 00:14:43.669
So we have “a bus”.

00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:45.029
“a bus”.

00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:47.519
Again, that means one bus.

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.389
“a box”.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.259
“a box”.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:53.119
“a watch”.

00:14:53.119 --> 00:14:54.989
“a watch”.

00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:56.859
Okay, one.

00:14:56.859 --> 00:14:58.730
“a kiss”.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.600
“a kiss”.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.600
And “an ax”.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600
“an ax”.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600
One.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600
“an ax”.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.600
Okay…

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.600
Now, we’re going to move on to the plural.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.879
Remember, again, to make the plural, or more
than one, here, we add ‘es’.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:13.879
Okay…

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.669
“a bus”.

00:15:15.669 --> 00:15:16.669
One.

00:15:16.669 --> 00:15:18.470
“two buses”.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.329
“two buses”.

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:22.199
“a box”.

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:24.059
“three boxes”.

00:15:24.059 --> 00:15:25.919
.
“three boxes”

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:27.790
“a watch”.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.649
“four watches”.

00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:31.519
‘es’ right.

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.379
“four watches”.

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:35.239
“a kiss”.

00:15:35.239 --> 00:15:36.239
One.

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:38.040
“five kisses”.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.899
“five kisses”.

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:42.319
Add the ‘es’.

00:15:42.319 --> 00:15:43.559
And the last one.

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:44.660
“an ax”.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.749
“an ax”.

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:48.209
Okay, we have “six axes”.

00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:49.839
“six axes”.

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:51.470
Don’t forget.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.360
We have to put ‘es’ to make these nouns
plural.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.320
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:06.300
So, how do we know if we should put ‘s’
or ‘es’ to make the noun plural?

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.759
Well, for most nouns, you just have to put
‘s’.

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:12.509
Okay, for most of them.

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:15.479
But, for some, you have to put ‘es’.

00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:16.819
And how do we know?

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:19.589
Well… let’s look at the board.

00:16:19.589 --> 00:16:21.220
We have some nouns.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.579
The first one is “church”.

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:24.639
Okay…

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:27.759
“Church” ends in ‘ch’.

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:34.139
So if the noun ends in ‘ch’, you have
to put ‘es’.

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:36.420
Okay…

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.139
So it becomes “churches”.

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:44.929
So again, if the noun ends in ‘ch’, add
‘es’ at the end to make it plural.

00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:48.519
The same goes for the next word “brush”.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:52.799
You’ll notice “brush” ends in ‘sh’.

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:53.989
Okay…

00:16:53.989 --> 00:17:02.069
So if it ends in ‘sh’, same thing, we
add ‘es’ at the end to make it plural.

00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:03.350
Okay…

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.620
The next word is fox.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.439
We have the letter ‘x’ at the end.

00:17:08.439 --> 00:17:09.509
Okay…

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:15.419
All nouns that end in ‘x’, we have to
put ‘es’ to make it plural.

00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:20.500
Okay, so, ‘ch’, ‘sh’, ‘x’.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.009
If the noun ends with these, put ‘es’.

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:24.939
And the last one is “dress”.

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:27.649
Okay, we have ‘ss’ at the end.

00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:29.159
Same thing.

00:17:29.159 --> 00:17:33.250
Put ‘es’ at the end to make it plural.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.250
Okay…

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.250
“Dresses”.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.429
Again, if it ends in ‘ss’ put ‘es’.

00:17:38.429 --> 00:17:46.320
Okay, so please, don’t forget ‘ch’,
‘sh’, ‘x’, ‘ss’, we must put ‘es’

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.669
at the end.

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:50.330
Most of the other nouns we just add ‘s’.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.330
Okay…

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.730
Now we have some special nouns on this side.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.840
“Potato, tomato, volcano”.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:04.820
Now, most nouns that end in ‘o’, like
“photo”, all we have to do is add an ‘s’

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.260
to make it plural.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.260
“Photos”.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.260
Okay…

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:14.110
But these are special because we actually
have to put ‘es’ at the end… to make

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:18.179
them…plural.

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:22.250
Okay…

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.630
So we have “potatoes, tomatoes, volcanoes”.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.730
Again, these are a little bit special.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.950
For most nouns that end in ‘o’, we just
add ‘s’.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.600
Okay, and, uhhh, let’s go to the final part.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.720
Okay, let’s do some extra practice.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.220
On the board, I have some nouns.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.720
Some are singular and some are plural.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:53.059
We have to decide together if we should put
‘s’ or ‘es’ or make them singular.

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:54.059
Okay…

00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:58.080
So you have to listen carefully and remember
what we learned in this video.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.080
Okay…

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.580
“Two books”.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.389
Right, this is plural.

00:19:02.389 --> 00:19:03.390
There are two.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.279
“Two books”.

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:07.789
We have to put an ‘s’.

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:09.590
“Two books”.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.590
Okay…

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.759
The next one.

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.500
“Three class”.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.500
Hmmmm.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.549
“Class” ends with an ‘s’.

00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:18.429
So what do we put?

00:19:18.429 --> 00:19:20.909
“Three classes”.

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:23.380
“Three classes”.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.620
Okay…

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.139
So again the plural is “three classes”.

00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:29.139
Okay…

00:19:29.139 --> 00:19:30.990
“A lion”.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.889
“A lion”.

00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:34.279
Do we have to put anything?

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:35.279
No.

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:38.759
No ‘s’ or ‘es’ because this is singular.

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:40.860
There’s just one lion.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.630
“A lion”.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.399
“Six hats”.

00:19:44.399 --> 00:19:46.169
“Six hats”.

00:19:46.169 --> 00:19:49.730
We have to put an ‘s’.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.659
“Six hats”.

00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:52.659
Okay…

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:56.159
The next noun is “seven match”.

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:57.159
What do we out?

00:19:57.159 --> 00:19:59.250
Well, we have a ‘ch’.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.419
So we have to put “matches”.

00:20:01.419 --> 00:20:04.350
“Seven matches”.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.269
“Seven matches”.

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:08.740
Okay…

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.669
And the last one is “one bat”.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.679
“One bat”.

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:18.460
We do not put an ‘s’ or ‘es’ because
again, it’s just one.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.770
We don’t have to put anything after ‘bat’.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.950
Okay, this is singular.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.730
Okay, so, in this video, we learned how to
make a noun singular.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.730
Okay…

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.540
And how to make a noun plural.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.090
Remember, singular means one.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.690
Plural means more than one.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.529
And remember, don’t forget, we have to put
‘s’ or ‘es’.

00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:40.629
Okay…

00:20:40.629 --> 00:20:41.629
And thanks for joining.

00:20:41.629 --> 00:20:45.039
That’s the end of this video.

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:47.769
Bye.

00:20:47.769 --> 00:20:51.170
Hi everybody and welcome to this video.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.860
In this video, we’re going to talk about
subjective pronouns.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.590
So, let’s take a look at the board.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.590
Here they are.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.409
The subjective pronouns.

00:21:02.409 --> 00:21:04.000
Please take a careful look.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.620
They’re very important in English.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.620
Okay…

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.370
So, the first subjective pronoun is ‘I’.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.490
“I” means me.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.570
“I’m Esther”.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.610
“I”.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:17.650
“He”.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:23.309
Now, “he” is only used for boys or men.

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:24.309
Okay…

00:21:24.309 --> 00:21:25.309
“He”.

00:21:25.309 --> 00:21:28.240
So another boy or man is “he”.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.860
“She” is used for girls or women.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.190
Okay…

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.519
“She”.

00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:36.850
“It”.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:47.030
“It” is used for a place like a school,
an animal like a dog, or a thing like a chair.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.200
Okay…

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.380
“It”.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.399
The next one is “you”.

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:53.860
“You” means you.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.299
Okay…”you”.

00:21:55.299 --> 00:21:56.740
“We”.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.960
“We” means other people and me.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:08.730
For example, “I sing”, “you sing”,
then “we sing”.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.730
Okay…”we”.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.669
And the last one is “they”.

00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:17.500
“They” means many people, places, animals
or things.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.500
Okay…

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.889
So, more than one.

00:22:19.889 --> 00:22:24.179
If there’s more than one, we use the subjective
pronoun ‘they’.

00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:27.929
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:22:27.929 --> 00:22:34.710
Okay, so let’s practice together with subjective
pronouns.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:39.360
The first sentence on the board says, “Jenny
sings”.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.950
Now Jenny is one girl.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.530
So we can say, “She sings”.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.620
“Jack sings”.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.129
Jack is one boy.

00:22:50.129 --> 00:22:54.470
So we have to say, “he sings”.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:59.690
The last sentence says, “Jenny and Jack
sing”.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.909
Now Jenny and Jack are two people.

00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:05.850
So we have to say, “they sing”.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.110
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:13.519
Okay, let’s do some more practice.

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:17.629
The first sentence on the board says, “The
cat runs”.

00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:24.710
‘The cat’ is an animal, so we have to
say, “It runs”.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.679
The next sentence says, “The dog and cat
run”.

00:23:28.679 --> 00:23:33.809
Now, ‘the dog and cat’, they are two animals.

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:39.660
So anytime you have two or more things, we
say, “They run”.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.660
‘They’.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:46.850
Okay, now, for the last sentence, I’m going
to talk about my cat, Ongee.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.830
Ongee is a cat.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.450
He’s an animal.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.420
But, he has a name.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.640
He’s a boy cat.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.640
Okay and I love him.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.669
And he’s like family

00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:57.899
So, “Ongee runs”.

00:23:57.899 --> 00:24:00.490
I can say “He runs”.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.490
Okay…

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.999
Let’s move on to the next part.

00:24:03.999 --> 00:24:07.179
Okay, here are some more examples.

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:14.039
But, this time, you have to figure out the
subjective pronoun together with me.

00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.039
Okay…

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:19.200
So, “My students study”.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.220
What should we use?

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.290
Well, ‘My students’, there’s an ‘s’.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.290
Right…

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.850
They’re people and there’s more than one.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:29.390
Many people.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:38.010
So we have to use the subjective pronoun,
‘they’.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:44.630
“They study”.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.120
The next example.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.799
“John is handsome”.

00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:50.679
Okay, ‘John’, that’s a person.

00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:53.409
There’s only one.

00:24:53.409 --> 00:24:54.409
Right…

00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:56.360
And it’s a boy, ‘John’.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.370
So what should we use?

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:06.529
We have to use the subjective pronoun, ‘he’.

00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:07.529
One boy.

00:25:07.529 --> 00:25:08.789
We say, “he”.

00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:10.980
“He is handsome”.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.510
Okay, the last one.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.929
“Pizza is delicious”.

00:25:15.929 --> 00:25:19.000
‘Pizza’ is a thing.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.010
And there’s only one.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.010
Right…

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.650
There’s no ‘s’.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.970
One pizza.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.950
We say, “it”.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.540
“It is delicious”.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.540
Okay…

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.309
Let’s move on to some more examples.

00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:37.789
Okay, the first example says, “Seoul is
a city”.

00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:41.080
Now, ‘Seoul’ is a place.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.080
Okay…

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.019
So we have to use the subjective pronoun,
‘it’.

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:49.210
“It is a city”.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.759
The next example says, “My parents love
Ongee”.

00:25:53.759 --> 00:25:55.981
Now, ‘Ongee’ is my cat.

00:25:55.981 --> 00:25:57.880
“My parents love Ongee”.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.399
Well, ‘my parents’, they are two people.

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:04.059
My mom and my dad.

00:26:04.059 --> 00:26:06.960
So, what do I use?

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.100
I have to say, “they”.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.009
“They love Ongee”.

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:17.190
The last example is very similar to the second
one.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.220
“My parents and I love Ongee”.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.220
Okay…

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:26.759
The difference is… it says, “and I”.

00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:30.010
So this is ‘my parents’ with ‘me’.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.789
So I have to say, “we”.

00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:36.039
“We love Ongee”.

00:26:36.039 --> 00:26:37.129
Okay…

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:38.440
All of us.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.230
Okay, so, in this video we learned about subjective
pronouns.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.360
I hope you guys have a good understanding
of ‘when’ and ‘how’ to use them.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.330
Thank you for watching and I’ll see you
guys next time.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.809
Bye.

00:26:53.809 --> 00:26:56.759
Hi, everybody.

00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:58.330
Welcome to this video.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:04.749
Now, in this video, we’re going to talk
about subjective pronouns, ‘be’ verbs,

00:27:04.749 --> 00:27:07.620
and also, contractions.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.860
So let’s take a look at the board.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.860
Okay…

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.630
First, we have the subjective pronouns.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:21.030
And we have the ‘be’ verbs: am, is and
are.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.210
Okay…

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.330
So let’s look at the first one.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.190
“I am”.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.990
“I am Esther”.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.970
The contraction for ‘I am’ is ‘I’m’.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.110
“I’m”.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:42.179
Now, a contraction is a more common way of
saying subjective pronouns and their ‘be’

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:43.179
verb.

00:27:43.179 --> 00:27:45.480
It’s faster and quicker and shorter.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.399
Okay, it’s more common.

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:50.299
I want you to use contractions.

00:27:50.299 --> 00:27:51.299
Okay…

00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:55.970
So, “I am” becomes “I’m”.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.070
“He is”…”he’s”.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.179
“She is”…”she’s”.

00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:05.280
“It is”…”it’s”.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:11.929
Okay, let’s move on to the bottom.

00:28:11.929 --> 00:28:17.379
“You are” becomes “you’re”.

00:28:17.379 --> 00:28:18.740
“You’re”.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.460
“We are”…”we’re”.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.830
“We’re”.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.480
and “They are”.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.820
The contraction is “they’re”.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.940
“They’re”.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.080
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.110
Okay…

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:39.169
We’re going to take a look at some sentences
using the ‘be’ verbs.

00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:43.100
Now, notice on the board, I only used contractions.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.100
Okay…

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.679
For example, instead of “I am”, I’m
going to say “I’m”.

00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:50.970
So, the first sentence.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.899
“I’m a student”.

00:28:52.899 --> 00:28:54.019
Okay…

00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:55.389
This means one.

00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:58.179
So we have to say “a student”.

00:28:58.179 --> 00:28:59.210
“a”.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:05.119
Now many people make the mistake of saying,
“I’m student”, but that’s wrong.

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:06.119
Okay…

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:08.809
You have to put ‘a’.

00:29:08.809 --> 00:29:10.860
Before I read it, you have to listen carefully.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.960
‘I’m a’ sounds like one word.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960
“I’m a…”

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960
“I’m a…”

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.230
“I’m a student”.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.049
Okay…

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.649
Please repeat after me.

00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:23.850
“I’m a student”.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.039
“I’m a student”.

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:29.450
Okay, the next one, again, sounds like one
word.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:30.619
“He’s a…”.

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:31.789
“He’s a…”.

00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:32.789
Okay…so…

00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:34.129
“He’s a student”.

00:29:34.129 --> 00:29:35.129
Please repeat.

00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:37.200
“He’s a student”.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.500
“He’s a student”.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.039
Same thing.

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.350
“She’s a student”.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.350
Please repeat.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.000
“She’s a student”.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.750
“She’s a student”.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.289
The next sentence has ‘it’.

00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:57.600
Now remember, ‘it’ is only used for a
place, a thing or an animal.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.809
So we can’t have those things be a student.

00:30:00.809 --> 00:30:04.471
So we have to say, “It’s a dog”.

00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:05.471
Okay, please repeat.

00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:06.929
“It’s a dog”.

00:30:06.929 --> 00:30:08.769
“It’s a dog”.

00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:10.880
Okay, the next one.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.720
“You’re a student”.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.929
Please repeat.

00:30:14.929 --> 00:30:18.559
“You’re a student”.

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.580
“You’re a student”.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.580
Okay…

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.639
Now let’s look at ‘we’re’.

00:30:23.639 --> 00:30:24.659
“We’re students”.

00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:25.659
Okay…

00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:30.460
We took out the ‘a’ and we put an ‘s’
because ‘we’re’ means many people.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.360
Not one student, but many students.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.249
So, we have to say, “we’re students”.

00:30:37.249 --> 00:30:38.539
Please repeat.

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:41.130
“We’re students”.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.720
“We’re students”.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.759
The same thing goes for ‘they’.

00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:49.299
Again, ‘they’ means many people…or many
things.

00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:51.240
Here, we put ‘s’.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.200
And we took out the ‘a’.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.809
So, “they’re students”.

00:30:55.809 --> 00:30:56.809
Please repeat.

00:30:56.809 --> 00:30:58.480
“They’re students”.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.269
“They’re students”.

00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:04.259
Okay, we’re going to look at some more examples.

00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:07.519
Please listen and repeat carefully.

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:12.409
Let’s start with the first one: “I’m”.

00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:14.720
“I’m a boy”.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.389
“I’m a boy”.

00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:21.950
“I’m a girl”.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.080
“I’m a girl”.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.080
“He’s”.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.720
“He’s a man”.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.350
“He’s a man”.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.730
“He’s a boy”.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.330
“He’s a boy”.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.760
“She’s”.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.509
“She’s a woman”.

00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:41.860
“She’s a woman”.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.179
“She’s a girl”.

00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:47.480
“She’s a girl”.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.580
“It’s”.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.369
“It’s a chair”.

00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:53.980
“It’s a chair”.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.629
“It’s a cat”.

00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:59.409
“It’s a cat”.

00:31:59.409 --> 00:32:01.190
“You’re”.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.350
“You’re a singer”.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.049
“You’re a singer”.

00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:11.000
“You’re a friend”.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.960
“You’re a friend”.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.270
“We’re”.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.909
“We’re sisters”.

00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:21.539
“We’re sisters”.

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:24.179
“We’re brothers”.

00:32:24.179 --> 00:32:26.809
“We’re brothers”.

00:32:26.809 --> 00:32:28.129
“They’re”.

00:32:28.129 --> 00:32:30.760
“They’re people”.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.399
“They’re people”.

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:36.029
“They’re cars”.

00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:38.669
“They’re cars”.

00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:39.989
Okay…

00:32:39.989 --> 00:32:46.860
Well I hope that this video helped you understand
how to use subjective pronouns, their ‘be’

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.009
verbs, and also contractions.

00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:55.499
Now, before we go, I wanted to share a little
bit about myself using the lesson.

00:32:55.499 --> 00:32:57.700
So, first, remember, “I’m a…”.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.660
“I’m a girl”.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:04.389
Also, “I’m a teacher”.

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:07.929
“I’m an American”.

00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:14.440
Now, the word ‘American’ starts with the
vowel ‘a’, so we have to say ‘an’.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.080
“I’m an American”.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.629
And “I’m an animal lover”.

00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:22.259
Again, same thing.

00:33:22.259 --> 00:33:26.330
‘Animal’ starts with the vowel ‘a’,
so we have to put ‘an’.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.450
“I’m an animal lover”.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.690
And that means someone who loves animals.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.549
I love dogs and cats and other animals.

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:36.409
So, “I’m an animal lover”.

00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:37.409
Okay…

00:33:37.409 --> 00:33:39.559
Well, that’s it and thank you for watching.

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:42.230
And I’ll see you guys next time.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.730
Bye.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.730
Hi, everybody.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:53.999
In this video, we’re going to talk about
subjective pronouns, ‘be’ verbs, and how

00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:55.860
to use them with the word ‘not’.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:56.860
Okay…

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.909
So, let’s look at the board to help us out.

00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:04.840
Now the first sentence says, “I’m not
a student”.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.980
‘Not’ means it’s not true.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.980
No.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.089
So remember, “I’m a student” means ‘yes’.

00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:13.349
“I’m a student”.

00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:15.580
I go to school and I learn.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.280
“I’m not a student” means ‘no’.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.389
“I’m a teacher” or “No, I’m not
a student”.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:23.389
Okay…

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:29.940
Now, notice, we first have the subjective
pronoun and the ‘be’ verb.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.940
Then, we put ‘not’.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:32.940
Okay…

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.859
‘Not’ comes after.

00:34:34.859 --> 00:34:36.860
And then we have the noun.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.860
Okay…

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.960
“I’m not a student”.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.960
Okay…

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.579
Now, also, listen carefully.

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:46.040
“Not a…” sounds like one word.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.869
“I’m not a student”.

00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:49.470
“Not a…”.

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:50.950
“I’m not a student”.

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:54.270
Okay, let’s look at the next one.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.440
“He’s not a student”.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.839
“He’s not a student”.

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:02.630
“She’s not a student”.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.869
“She’s not a student”.

00:35:05.869 --> 00:35:09.220
“It’s not a dog”.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:15.410
Remember, ‘it’ is used for place, thing
or animal.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.170
So, “It’s not a dog”.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.290
Okay…

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.319
“You’re not a student”.

00:35:22.319 --> 00:35:24.460
“You’re not a student”.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.760
Okay, the next one is a little bit different.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.390
We have ‘we are’.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:31.390
“We’re”.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.650
Now, remember, ‘we’ means more than one.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:35.650
Many.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:36.650
Okay…

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:37.650
So we say “students”.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:41.079
We put an ‘s’ and we don’t put an ‘a’
in front.

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:43.130
“We’re not students”.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.980
“We’re not students”.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.170
Okay…and ‘they’re’ is the same thing.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.839
It means more than one.

00:35:50.839 --> 00:35:53.480
So, “They’re not students”.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.490
“They’re not students”.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:59.010
Okay, we’re going to look at some more examples.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.540
I want you to listen carefully and repeat
after the examples.

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.420
Let’s start with the first one.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.220
“I’m not”.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.750
“I’m not a boy”.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.790
“I’m not a boy”.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.829
“I’m not a girl”.

00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:19.670
“I’m not a girl”.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:22.240
“He’s not”.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.210
“He’s not a man”.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.579
“He’s not a man”.

00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:31.880
“He’s not a boy”.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.720
“He’s not a boy”.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.220
“She’s not”.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.450
“She’s not a woman”.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:43.960
“She’s not a woman”.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.130
“She’s not a girl”.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.080
“She’s not a girl”.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.760
“It’s not”.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.030
“It’s not a chair”.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.520
“It’s not a chair”.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.750
“It’s not a cat”.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:05.730
“It’s not a cat”.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.369
“You’re not”.

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:15.390
“You’re not a singer”
“You’re not a singer”.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.790
“You’re not a friend”.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:21.770
“You’re not a friend”.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.569
“We’re not”.

00:37:24.569 --> 00:37:27.690
“We’re not sisters”.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.140
“We’re not sisters”.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.210
“We’re not brothers”.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.089
“We’re not brothers”.

00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:39.460
“They’re not”.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.430
“They’re not people”.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.400
“They’re not people”.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.980
“They’re not cars”.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.280
“They’re not cars”.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:38:01.000
Okay, so in this video, we learned how to
use subjective pronouns with the ‘be’

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.849
verb and how to use them with the word ‘not’.

00:38:03.849 --> 00:38:04.849
Okay…

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:10.609
So, I wrote some sentences about myself using
what we learned.

00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:13.079
So remember, “I’m not a…”.

00:38:13.079 --> 00:38:14.079
Okay…

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:15.760
“I’m not a boy”.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.059
“I’m not a boy”.

00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:20.690
“I’m not a student”.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:22.870
“I’m not a student”.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:25.600
“I’m not a Canadian”.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.750
“I’m not a Canadian”.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.809
And the last one.

00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:31.420
“I’m not a loser”.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.839
“I’m not a loser”.

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:35.119
Okay…

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:36.890
So that was a little bit about me.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:41.320
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you guys
next time.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.170
Bye.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.880
Hi, everybody.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.760
In this video, I’m going to talk about how
to make questions using subjective pronouns

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.250
and ‘be’ verbs.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:55.250
Okay…

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:57.650
So, let’s take a look at the board.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.700
So, this example sentence says.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.079
“I’m a student”.

00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:03.079
Okay…

00:39:03.079 --> 00:39:07.770
Remember, “I’m” is just a contraction
for “I am”.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:08.770
Okay…

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.619
So, “I’m a student”.

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:12.910
“I am a student”.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:15.770
They mean the same thing.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:20.660
Now when we want to make a question, we just
have to make a simple change.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.559
It’s very easy.

00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:26.690
All you have to do is put the ‘be’ verb
in the front.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.690
Okay…

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.650
So, “Am I a student?”.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.289
“Am I a student?”.

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:35.680
The ‘be’ verb comes in the front.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.680
Okay…

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.570
I also want you to listen to my intonation.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:45.000
When I say it in a sentence, “I’m a student”.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.180
“I’m a student”.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.430
Okay, then when I say it in a question.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.530
“Am I a student?”.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:54.190
“Am I a student?”.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:57.690
Notice my intonation goes up for the question.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:03.240
Okay, now there are two possible answers for
this question.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.839
“Am I a student?”.

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:08.339
The answers you can say are:

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.380
“Yes, I am”.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.780
“Yes, I am”.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:13.780
Okay…

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.900
And, “No, I’m not”.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.380
“No, I’m not”.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.380
Okay…

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.390
We’re going to look at some more examples.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.310
Please make sure you repeat after each example.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.980
Let’s look at the first one.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.980
“Am I…?”.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.799
“Am I a girl?”.

00:40:32.799 --> 00:40:35.240
“Yes, I am”.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.369
“Am I a boy?”.

00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:39.820
“No, I’m not”.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.640
“Am I a singer?”.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.869
“Yes, I am”.

00:40:44.869 --> 00:40:50.059
“Am I a friend?”.

00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:51.059
“No, I’m not”.

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:52.059
Okay…

00:40:52.059 --> 00:40:58.089
Now, we’re going to talk about “he is”
and “she is” and how to use them in questions.

00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:00.470
So let’s look at the sentence on the board.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.190
“He’s a doctor”.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.190
Or…

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.609
“She’s a doctor”.

00:41:06.609 --> 00:41:15.750
Remember, “he’s” and “she’s” are
contractions for “he is” and “she is”.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.220
The ‘be’ verb there is ‘is’.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:24.289
So, when we make a question, we have to move
the ‘be’ verb to the front.

00:41:24.289 --> 00:41:25.289
Okay…

00:41:25.289 --> 00:41:27.210
So we put ‘is’ in the front.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.119
“Is he a doctor?”.

00:41:30.119 --> 00:41:33.589
“Is she a doctor?”.

00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:34.589
Okay…

00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:35.589
Very easy.

00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:37.410
Just put the ‘be’ verb in the front.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:41.220
Now I want you to listen to the intonation
again.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.150
“He’s a doctor”.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.150
Okay…

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.619
The intonation is going down.

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:50.309
“Is he a doctor?”.

00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:53.450
In the question, again, the intonation goes
up.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.500
Okay…

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.329
Now when you answer, they are several possible
answers you can give.

00:41:59.329 --> 00:42:00.329
So…

00:42:00.329 --> 00:42:02.970
“Yes, he is”.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:03.970
Or…

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.609
“Yes, she is”.

00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:07.609
Okay…

00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:09.339
That’s easy.

00:42:09.339 --> 00:42:14.880
When you come to know, this is where it gets
a little tricky, but you can do it.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.000
“No, he isn’t”.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.359
Okay, “isn’t” is a contraction for “is
not”.

00:42:22.359 --> 00:42:23.359
Okay…

00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:24.819
“No, he isn’t”.

00:42:24.819 --> 00:42:25.819
Or…

00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:27.900
“No, she isn’t”.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:33.440
Okay, so you can use “she isn’t”, “he
isn’t”.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.329
Another answer you can give is “No, he’s
not”.

00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:39.329
Or…

00:42:39.329 --> 00:42:42.280
“No, she’s not”.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.770
You already know this is a contraction for
‘he is’ and ‘she is’.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.260
So, “No, he’s not”.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.120
“No, she’s not”.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.120
Okay…

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.819
So these are both common.

00:42:54.819 --> 00:42:57.720
And they’re both ok to use.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720
Okay…

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.710
So, remember, we can give two different answers
for ‘no’.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:06.270
Alright, now we’re going to look at some
more examples.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:09.030
Please make sure you repeat after each example.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:12.270
“Is he…?”, “Is she…?”.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:14.470
“Is he a man?”

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.800
“Yes, he is”.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.630
“Is he a cowboy?”.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.220
“No, he isn’t.”

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:26.280
“Is she a woman?”

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.280
“Yes, she is”.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.500
“Is she a cowgirl?”.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:34.500
“No, she’s not.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.500
Okay…

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.970
Now, we’re going to move on to ‘it is’.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:38.970
Okay…

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.900
And how to use that in a question.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.330
So, let’s look at the board.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.420
“It’s a dog”.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.280
Okay, we have the contraction “it’s”.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:54.410
Remember, “it’s” is a contraction for
“it is”.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.589
The ‘be’ verb is ‘is’.

00:43:57.589 --> 00:44:03.099
When we make a question, remember, we have
to put the ‘be’ verb in the front.

00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:06.240
“Is it a dog?”

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.680
“Is it a dog?”

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680
Okay…

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.150
The intonation goes up for the question.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.329
“Is it a dog?”

00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:14.369
Okay…

00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:18.690
Now, there are several answer you can give.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.910
The first one is “Yes, it is”.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.340
“Yes, it is”.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.340
Okay…

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.579
When you say “no”, you can give two answers.

00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:31.900
“No, it isn’t”.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.200
“No, it isn’t”.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:39.559
Remember, “isn’t” is a contraction for
“is not”.

00:44:39.559 --> 00:44:40.579
Okay…

00:44:40.579 --> 00:44:44.000
We can also say “No, it’s not”.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.309
“No, it’s not”.

00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:49.660
“It’s” is a contraction for “it is”.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:50.660
Okay…

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:55.800
So again, remember, we have these two answers
for ‘no’, but they’re both common and

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.180
they’re both ok to use when you say “no”.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.180
Okay…

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.460
We’re going to look at some more examples.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.079
Please make sure you follow and repeat after
each one.

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:07.849
“Is it…?”.

00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:09.869
“Is it a book?”.

00:45:09.869 --> 00:45:13.080
“Yes, it is”.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.930
“Is it a chair?”.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.240
“No, it isn’t”.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.670
“Is it a shoe?”.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:24.539
“Yes, it is”.

00:45:24.539 --> 00:45:28.059
“Is it a car?”.

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:29.059
“No, it’s not”.

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.059
Okay…

00:45:30.059 --> 00:45:34.680
Now, we’re going to move on to “you are”
and put that in a question.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.680
Okay…

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.890
On the board the sentence says.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.400
“You’re a boy”.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:44.750
Remember, “you’re” is a contraction
for “you are”.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.980
The ‘be’ verb is ‘are’.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.770
So we have to put that in the front of the
question.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.849
“Are you a boy?”

00:45:52.849 --> 00:45:55.390
“Are you a boy?”

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:56.690
Okay…

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:59.359
When we answer, it’s very simple.

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:04.750
We can say, “Yes, I am” or “No, I’m
not”.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:05.750
Okay…

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.150
We’re going to look at some more examples.

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:12.710
Please follow and repeat after each one.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.880
“Are you…?”.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.599
“Are you a Korean?”.

00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:22.960
“Yes, I am”
“Are you a clown?”.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.240
“No, I’m not”.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.250
“Are you a nurse?”.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:34.579
“Yes, I am”
“Are you a dancer?”.

00:46:34.579 --> 00:46:36.789
“No, I’m not”.

00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:37.789
Okay…

00:46:37.789 --> 00:46:43.880
Now, let’s talk about “we are” and how
to use that in a question.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.960
Okay…

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.190
So the sentence here says, “We’re teachers”.

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:50.190
Okay…

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:54.270
“We’re” is a contraction fro “we are”.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:58.130
So the ‘be’ verb ‘are’ goes in the
front.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:59.910
“Are we teachers?”

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:02.309
“Are we teachers?”

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:03.559
Okay…

00:47:03.559 --> 00:47:06.460
When we answer, we can say several things.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.590
“Yes, we are”.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.990
“Yes, we are”.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:12.070
Or…

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.609
“No, we aren’t”.

00:47:14.609 --> 00:47:16.069
Listen…”aren’t”.

00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:18.539
“No, we aren’t”.

00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:23.500
“Aren’t” is a contraction for “are
not”.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:27.230
Or we can say, “No, we’re not”.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.619
“No, we’re not”.

00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:33.920
And you know “We’re” is a contraction
for “we are”.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.920
Okay…

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.230
We’re going to look at some more examples.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.740
Please repeat after each one.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.490
“Are we…?”.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.760
“Are we boys?”.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.839
“Yes, we are”.

00:47:46.839 --> 00:47:49.670
“Are we girls?”.

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.440
“No, we aren’t”.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.150
“Are we friends?”.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:58.220
“Yes, we are”.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.150
“Are we pro-gamers?”.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.720
“No, we aren’t”.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.720
Okay…

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:10.190
Now, we’re moving on to ‘they are’ in
a question.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:14.309
The sentence on the board says, “They’re
friends”.

00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:19.450
Remember, ‘They’re’ is a contraction
for ‘they are’.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:25.430
The ‘b’ verb ‘are’ goes in the front
of the question.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.599
“Are they friends?”

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:29.310
“Are they friends?”

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:30.310
Okay…

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.640
Now when we answer, we can say, “Yes, they
are”.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.480
“Yes, they are”.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.700
Or, we can say, “No, they aren’t”.

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.900
“No, they aren’t”.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.859
‘Aren’t’ is a contraction for ‘are
not’.

00:48:47.859 --> 00:48:51.780
The last thing we can say is “No, they’re
not”.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.069
“No, they’re not”.

00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:57.690
‘They’re’ is a contraction for ‘they
are’.

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:02.029
These two answers for ‘no’ are both correct.

00:49:02.029 --> 00:49:03.029
And they’re both common.

00:49:03.029 --> 00:49:05.789
So you can say either one.

00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:06.789
Okay…

00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:09.520
We’re going to look at some more examples
now.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.920
Please repeat after each example.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.279
“Are they…?”

00:49:14.279 --> 00:49:16.230
“Are they tourists?”

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:17.760
“Yes, they are.”

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.400
“Are they dogs?”

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.920
“No, they aren’t.”

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.150
“Are they computers?”

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.280
“Yes, they are.”

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.410
“Are they birds?”

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:33.540
“No, they’re not.”

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.589
Okay…

00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:40.210
In this lesson, we learned how to change a
subjective pronoun and a ‘b’ verb into

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.460
a question.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:47.130
Remember, when you’re making a question,
you have to put the ‘b’ verb in the beginning.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:48.130
Okay…

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.200
Alright, that’s the end of this video.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.609
Thanks for watching.

00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:54.900
Bye.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:59.619
Okay, so this is a review video.

00:49:59.619 --> 00:50:04.200
We learned about subjective pronouns and ‘be’
verbs.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:09.190
We also learned how to use them in a negative
sentence and in a question.

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.470
So, let’s look at the board for review.

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:15.000
“I am a teacher.”

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.380
Remember, ‘am’ is the ‘b’ verb.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.030
“I am a teacher.”

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:24.520
Okay, we also learned contractions: “I’m”.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.400
“I’m a teacher.”

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.289
“I’m a teacher.”

00:50:28.289 --> 00:50:31.020
Okay, this is a negative sentence.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.579
“I’m not a teacher.”

00:50:32.579 --> 00:50:34.599
“I’m not a teacher.”

00:50:34.599 --> 00:50:39.029
Remember, ‘not’ goes after the ‘b’
verb.

00:50:39.029 --> 00:50:40.029
Okay…

00:50:40.029 --> 00:50:41.430
And here’s a question.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:42.829
“Am I a teacher?”

00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:44.809
“Am I a teacher?”

00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:49.390
Remember, the ‘be’ verb comes in the front
for a question.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:50.390
Okay…

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.990
We’re going to listen to some more examples.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:55.760
I want you to repeat after each one.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.760
Okay…

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.110
Let’s look at some examples.

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:01.599
“He is a king.”

00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:03.079
“He is a king.”

00:51:03.079 --> 00:51:04.340
“He’s a king.”

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.730
“He’s a king.”

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:09.869
“He’s not a king.”

00:51:09.869 --> 00:51:11.910
“He’s not a king.”

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:13.670
“Is he a king?”

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.799
“Is he a king?”

00:51:15.799 --> 00:51:16.980
Next.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.990
“She is a queen.”

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:21.079
“She is a queen.”

00:51:21.079 --> 00:51:23.220
“She’s a queen.”

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.550
“She’s a queen.”

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:26.740
“She’s not a queen.”

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.510
“She’s not a queen.”

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:30.810
“Is she a queen?”

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.079
“Is she a queen?”

00:51:33.079 --> 00:51:34.250
Next.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.270
“It is a monkey.”

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.529
“It is a monkey.”

00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:41.289
“It’s a monkey.”

00:51:41.289 --> 00:51:42.910
“It’s a monkey.”

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.069
“It’s not a monkey.”

00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:46.160
“It’s not a monkey.”

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.490
“Is it a monkey?”

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:50.589
“Is it a monkey?”

00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:51.760
Next.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.690
“You are a cook.”

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:55.849
“You are a cook.”

00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:57.720
“You’re a cook.”

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.250
“You’re a cook.”

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.130
“You’re not a cook.”

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:02.839
“You’re not a cook.”

00:52:02.839 --> 00:52:04.780
“Are you a cook?”

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.819
“Are you a cook?”

00:52:06.819 --> 00:52:08.020
Next.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.410
“We are friends.”

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:12.930
“We are friends.”

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.390
“We’re friends.”

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.460
“We’re friends.”

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.730
“We’re not friends.”

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.480
“We’re not friends.”

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.510
“Are we friends?”

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:26.400
“Are we friends?”

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.450
And last.

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:29.289
“They are monkeys.”

00:52:29.289 --> 00:52:31.770
“They are monkeys.”

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.750
“They’re monkeys.”

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.440
“They’re monkeys.”

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.550
“They’re not monkeys.”

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:39.290
“They’re not monkeys.”

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.329
“Are they monkeys?”

00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:44.069
“Are they monkeys?”

00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:45.069
Okay…

00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:52.029
So that was our review of subjective pronouns,
‘be’ verbs, how to use them with ‘not’,

00:52:52.029 --> 00:52:54.650
and how to use them in questions.

00:52:54.650 --> 00:53:00.619
I really hope that you repeated each example
that I gave because pronunciation is very

00:53:00.619 --> 00:53:01.619
important.

00:53:01.619 --> 00:53:06.310
Now, if you didn’t, you should go back and
watch it again and repeat.

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:07.310
Okay…

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.609
Well that’s all.

00:53:08.609 --> 00:53:10.990
Thank you.

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:13.150
Bye.

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.329
Okay…

00:53:15.329 --> 00:53:20.010
This is a checkup for subjective pronouns
and ‘be’ verbs.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:22.569
Let’s take a look at the board.

00:53:22.569 --> 00:53:24.240
The first sentence.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.450
“___, are bags.”

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.790
Now, bags are things.

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:33.980
So we can’t say “he” or “she” or,
you know, any of those.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:37.110
We have to use “it” or “they”.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:40.819
Now, we have “are….bags”.

00:53:40.819 --> 00:53:42.090
With an ‘s’.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.990
So that means more than one.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:47.829
We have to use ‘they’.

00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:50.560
“They are bags.”

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.349
Okay…

00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:56.589
The next sentence we have an animal.
“____ is a dog.”

00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:57.690
Okay…

00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.420
But, just one.

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.420
Right?

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.420
’a’ dog.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.900
So this time we use ‘it’.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.309
“It is a dog.”

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:08.760
Now let’s look at these two.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.099
“The girl is an artist.”

00:54:12.099 --> 00:54:15.049
We have ‘the girl’.

00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:19.240
What is the subjective pronoun for one girl?

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.800
“She.”

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.250
“She is an artist.”

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:27.819
The two sentences have the same meaning.

00:54:27.819 --> 00:54:29.829
They’re the same.

00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:33.579
Okay, and on the bottom, we have a question.

00:54:33.579 --> 00:54:38.330
When we ask a question, we have to put the
‘be’ verb first.

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.840
“Are ___ pandas?”

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.350
“Are ___ pandas?”

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:45.859
With an ‘s’.

00:54:45.859 --> 00:54:47.529
That means more than one.

00:54:47.529 --> 00:54:50.290
So, we say, “they”.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:52.200
“Are they pandas?”

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.410
“Yes, ____ are.”

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.550
Again plural.

00:54:57.550 --> 00:54:59.470
So we just use the same.

00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:00.470
“They.”

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:01.809
“Yes, they are.”

00:55:01.809 --> 00:55:04.500
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:09.950
Okay, now we’re going to focus on negatives
and questions.

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:14.210
Okay, the first sentence says, “I’m a
student”.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:18.119
Okay, “I am…I’m a student”.

00:55:18.119 --> 00:55:19.119
Okay…

00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:20.519
What if I’m a teacher?

00:55:20.519 --> 00:55:22.069
Okay, it’s not true.

00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:23.320
I need ‘not’.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.320
Right…

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:28.970
Remember, ‘not’ goes after the ‘be’
verb.

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:32.349
“I am…am not.”

00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:35.170
And then the noun.
“…a student.”

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:37.029
“I’m not a student.”

00:55:37.029 --> 00:55:38.150
Okay…

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:40.900
“They are teachers.”

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.900
Okay…

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:46.980
And now we have some other people…and that’s
not true.

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:51.950
“They are not teachers.”

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:58.180
Again, after the ‘be’ verb ‘are’ and
before the noun ‘teachers’.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.809
“They are not teachers.”

00:56:00.809 --> 00:56:01.809
Okay…

00:56:01.809 --> 00:56:04.510
Now, I’m going to ask you a question.

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:06.550
And you have to answer.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:09.519
“Are you a student?”

00:56:09.519 --> 00:56:12.039
“Are you a student?”

00:56:12.039 --> 00:56:15.900
Well, you’re taking my class, you’re learning
English.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.210
So, “Yes, I am.”

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:21.480
Okay, you should say, “Yes, I am.”

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.430
But how about this one?

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:25.299
“Are you a monkey?”

00:56:25.299 --> 00:56:28.260
“Are you a monkey?”

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.619
Of course the answer is “No, I’m not”.

00:56:31.619 --> 00:56:33.630
“No, I’m not”.

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:37.280
Okay, let’s move on to the last part.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.630
Okay…

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:43.980
Now for this last part, we’re going to look
at some sentences, but there’s something

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.849
wrong in all of these sentences.

00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:50.500
So you have to find the mistakes.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:54.420
The first sentence says, “I’m student”.

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.299
Okay, look, “student”.

00:56:57.299 --> 00:57:00.180
There’s no ‘s’.

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.860
That means just one.

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.609
Just one.

00:57:03.609 --> 00:57:07.740
So remember, if there’s just one, we have
to put ‘a’.

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:09.039
“I’m a student.”

00:57:09.039 --> 00:57:14.109
Let’s look at the next one.

00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:16.940
“They are student”.

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.559
Okay…

00:57:18.559 --> 00:57:21.579
This one says “They are”.

00:57:21.579 --> 00:57:23.840
This means there is more than one.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.420
More than one student.

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.599
So, what do we have to do?

00:57:28.599 --> 00:57:33.990
We have to say “They are….students”.

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:39.109
We have to put an ‘s’ to show there’s
more than one student.

00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:43.200
“She aren’t a baby.”

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.570
“She.”

00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:46.680
That’s one person.

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.670
One girl or woman.

00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:50.309
“…a baby.”

00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:52.150
That’s one person.

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:54.140
But we put “aren’t”.

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.339
Now that’s wrong.

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.799
We have to say….”isn’t”.

00:57:57.799 --> 00:58:01.380
“She isn’t a baby”.

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:06.440
“You isn’t a cat”.

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:16.040
Now, for the subjective pronoun ‘you’,
we have to have the ‘be’ verb ‘are’.

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:22.779
So not “You isn’t a cat”, but “You
aren’t….a cat”.

00:58:22.779 --> 00:58:24.660
“You aren’t a cat.”

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.099
Okay…

00:58:26.099 --> 00:58:28.940
“Are it a cat?”

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.630
Okay…
“…a cat.”

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.839
That’s one animal.

00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:36.480
So, do we need ‘are’?

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:41.930
No, we need the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.550
“Is it a cat?”

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:49.430
Okay, so that was the checkup for subjective
pronouns and ‘be’ verbs.

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:54.000
I hope you guys understood and I’ll see
you in the next video.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.710
Bye.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:59.150
Hi, everybody.

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:05.109
In this video, we’re going to learn how
to make questions using ‘what’ and ‘be’

00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:06.109
verbs.

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:07.109
Okay…

00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:11.000
Now when we have one thing, we have to use
the ‘be’ verb ‘is’.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
“What is it?”

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.380
“What is it?”

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:22.069
“It is a watch.”

00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:25.099
“It is a watch.”

00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:30.740
It’s one thing, so I have to say ‘a’.
“a watch.”

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:35.500
I can also use the contraction for ‘it is’,
“it’s”.

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.640
Okay, now listen.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.490
“It’s a ….”
“It’s a ….”

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.710
“It’s a watch.”

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:45.660
“It’s a watch.”

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:48.599
“What is it?”

00:59:48.599 --> 00:59:51.549
“What is it?”

00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:53.319
“It’s a marker.”

00:59:53.319 --> 00:59:55.520
“It’s a marker.”

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.609
Okay…

00:59:57.609 --> 01:00:01.579
Now, there are two highlighters.

01:00:01.579 --> 01:00:03.500
Okay, two.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.180
We use ‘are’.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.760
“What are they?”

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.180
“What are they?”

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.920
“They are highlighters.”

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.829
“They are highlighters.”

01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:22.240
We have more than one, so we have to say “are”.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.549
And we have to put an ‘s’ at the end.

01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:32.080
Again, we can use a contraction for ‘they
are’: “they’re”.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.950
“They’re highlighters.”

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.050
“They’re highlighters.”

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:42.430
“What are they?”

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.819
“What are they?”

01:00:44.819 --> 01:00:46.730
“They’re markers.”

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.519
“They’re markers.”

01:00:48.519 --> 01:00:49.519
Okay…

01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:55.470
We’re going to look at some examples and
I’m going to ask some questions.

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:59.420
We please try to answer them.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:03.170
Listen carefully and answer with “It’s
a” or “They’re”.

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.440
Let’s look at the first one.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.250
“What is it?”

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.089
“What is it?”

01:01:09.089 --> 01:01:11.240
“It’s a key.”

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.960
“It’s a key.”

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.190
“What are they?”

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:20.079
“What are they?”

01:01:20.079 --> 01:01:23.890
“They’re keys.”

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:27.700
“They’re keys.”

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.670
“What is it?”

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:33.430
“What is it?”

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.950
“It’s a chair.”

01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:39.050
“It’s a chair.”

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:42.319
“What are they?”

01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:45.950
“What are they?”

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:48.369
“They’re chairs.”

01:01:48.369 --> 01:01:50.789
“They’re chairs.”

01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:53.140
“What is it?”

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.660
“What is it?”

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.539
“It’s a cat.”

01:01:57.539 --> 01:01:59.700
“It’s a cat.”

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:03.730
“What are they?”

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:06.140
“What are they?”

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.690
“They’re cats.”

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.240
“They’re cats.”

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.750
“What is it?”

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:16.190
“What is it?”

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.730
“It’s a house.”

01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:23.259
“It’s a house.”

01:02:23.259 --> 01:02:25.599
“What are they?”

01:02:25.599 --> 01:02:27.700
“What are they?”

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.619
“They’re houses.”

01:02:29.619 --> 01:02:31.539
“They’re houses.”

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:32.539
Okay…

01:02:32.539 --> 01:02:39.180
Now let’s focus on pronunciation and saying
these fast.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.180
Okay…

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:45.490
English speakers speak very quickly, so you
have to practice as well.

01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:46.490
Okay…

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:48.039
“What is it?”

01:02:48.039 --> 01:02:52.309
Okay, let’s try it faster three times
“What is it?”

01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:53.750
“What is it?”

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.190
“What is it?”

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:57.220
It sounds like one word.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.670
Okay, and the answer is also very fast.

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:02.029
“It’s a…”

01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:03.390
“It’s a…”

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:04.750
“It’s a…”

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:06.050
“It’s a pencil.”

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.779
“It’s a chair.”

01:03:07.779 --> 01:03:09.300
“It’s a marker.”

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.410
Okay…

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:13.599
When we have more than one, we say, “What
are they?”.

01:03:13.599 --> 01:03:16.500
Let’s do it fast three times.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.130
“What are they?”

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:19.589
“What are they?”

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:21.640
“What are they?”

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.910
Okay…

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:24.410
And when you answer.

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:25.450
“They’re…”

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:29.599
“They’re pencils”
“They’re chairs”

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:36.029
“They’re markers”
Okay, so this video was ‘what’ and ‘be’

01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:37.029
verbs.

01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:40.799
I hope you understood and I’ll see you in
the next video.

01:03:40.799 --> 01:03:42.480
Bye.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.520
Hi, everybody, and welcome.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.480
In this video, we’re going to talk about
‘this’ and ‘that’.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:04:00.430
Now ‘this’ and ‘that’ are used to
talk about nouns that are close to us, near

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:01.910
or far away.

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:02.910
Okay…

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:05.150
So let’s look at the board.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:07.920
“This is a flower.”

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:16.920
Okay, we use ‘this’ to talk about one
noun, “a flower”, that is close.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.920
Okay…

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.960
“This is a flower.”

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.300
It’s not far.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.420
It’s close.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.540
“That is a flower.”

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:33.290
Okay, we use ‘that’ to talk about one
noun that’s far away.

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:37.440
So, “That….that is a flower”.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.849
Okay…

01:04:38.849 --> 01:04:40.559
For another example…

01:04:40.559 --> 01:04:43.190
“This is a marker.”

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:46.160
It’s close to me.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.250
But, “That….that is a marker”.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.089
It’s far away.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:55.839
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:04:55.839 --> 01:04:58.369
Okay, so we know…

01:04:58.369 --> 01:05:00.400
“This is a flower.”

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.359
Okay…

01:05:02.359 --> 01:05:04.529
And “That is a flower….that”.

01:05:04.529 --> 01:05:08.079
Now, “Is this a flower”?

01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:10.210
“What is it?”

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:12.250
“It’s a chair.”

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.819
So we have to use the negative.

01:05:14.819 --> 01:05:16.970
“This isn’t a flower.”

01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:25.630
It’s close by, but it isn’t a flower.
‘isn’t’ is a contraction for ‘is not’.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.630
Okay…

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:28.769
“This isn’t a flower.”

01:05:28.769 --> 01:05:31.119
“This is a chair.”

01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:34.609
“That isn’t a flower.”

01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:37.550
It’s far away, so we say “that”.

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:41.309
Again, we have ‘isn’t’, ‘a flower’.

01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:43.799
“That’s a chair.”

01:05:43.799 --> 01:05:46.089
And let’s take another example.

01:05:46.089 --> 01:05:49.170
“This isn’t a pencil.”

01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:51.220
“This is a marker.”

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.270
And…

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:55.259
“That isn’t a pencil.”

01:05:55.259 --> 01:05:57.500
“That is a marker.”

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.000
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.220
Okay, now we’re going to learn how to use
‘this’ and ‘that’ in a question.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.369
Okay…

01:06:09.369 --> 01:06:13.329
So we know “This is a flower”.

01:06:13.329 --> 01:06:16.500
When we make a question, we have to switch.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.009
We put the ‘be’ verb first.

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:21.990
So it becomes, “Is this a flower?”.

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:24.950
Okay, it’s close by.

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:28.770
So the answer is, “Yes, it is”.

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:29.829
Okay…

01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:32.390
“Is that a flower?”

01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:34.650
It’s far away.

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:38.349
The answer is, “Yes, it is”.

01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:40.650
Okay, but how about this?

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:42.599
“This isn’t a flower.”

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:46.650
“Is this a flower?”.

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:50.440
The answer is “No, it isn’t”.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.890
“Is that a flower?”

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:57.630
“No, it isn’t.”

01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:58.860
Okay, here.

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:01.430
“Is this a marker?”.

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:04.170
“Yes, it is.”

01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:07.180
“Is that a marker?”.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.829
“Yes, it is.”

01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:13.010
“Is this a pencil?”.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:15.670
“No, it isn’t.”

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:18.950
“Is that a pencil?”.

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:21.520
“No, it isn’t.”

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.920
Okay, so we learned ‘this’ and ‘that’
in this video.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.630
I hope you guys understand and I’ll see
you in the next video.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.519
Bye.

01:07:32.519 --> 01:07:36.970
Hi, everybody and welcome to this video.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.759
We’re going to talk about how to use ‘these’
and ‘those’.

01:07:41.759 --> 01:07:42.759
Okay…

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:50.609
Uhhh, just like we learned with ‘this’
and ‘that’, we use ‘these’ and ‘those’

01:07:50.609 --> 01:07:56.260
to talk about nouns that are close to us or
far from us.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260
Okay…

01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.529
So, let’s take a look at the board.

01:07:59.529 --> 01:08:08.339
Now, we know if there is just one, and it’s
close to us, we say, “This is a flower”.

01:08:08.339 --> 01:08:09.559
Okay…

01:08:09.559 --> 01:08:11.270
But there’s more than one.

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:12.849
It’s plural.

01:08:12.849 --> 01:08:15.570
So we have to say, “These”.

01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:18.009
“These are flowers.”

01:08:18.009 --> 01:08:20.610
Again, more than one.

01:08:20.610 --> 01:08:29.150
Now, I change the ‘be’ verb to ‘are’
and I added an ‘s’ at the end of ‘flower’.

01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:32.170
So, “These are flowers.”

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:33.170
Okay…

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:37.430
Now, there’s one that’s far away.

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:40.470
We say, “That is a flower.”

01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:43.440
But, again, there’s more than one.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:50.520
“There are two flowers”
So, in that case, we use, “Those are flowers.”

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.090
“Those are flowers.”

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:54.990
They’re far away.

01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:56.750
“Those are flowers.”

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:59.790
Let’s look at these.

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:01.560
“This is a marker.”

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.140
“These are markers.”

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:09.310
“That is a marker.”

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:13.610
“Those are markers.”

01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:14.610
Okay…

01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:18.330
Let’s move on to the next part.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:23.410
Okay, so we know “These are flowers”.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.870
They’re close by.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:31.830
And for the flowers that are far away, we
say, “Those are flowers”.

01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:32.850
Okay…

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:35.720
But over here we have ‘chairs’.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.980
So, we have to use the negative.

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:39.980
Okay…

01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:45.800
We use the contraction ‘aren’t’ which
is short for ‘are not’.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.410
“These aren’t flowers.”

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:52.040
“These aren’t flowers.”

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:59.770
Okay, and for the chairs that are far away,
we say, “Those aren’t flowers”.

01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:02.030
“Those aren’t flowers.”

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:06.290
Okay, and let’s try with the markers.

01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:09.680
“These aren’t pens.”

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.070
“These aren’t pens.”

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:16.060
Okay, and far away.

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.490
“Those aren’t pens.”

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:20.920
“Those aren’t pens.”

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.230
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:29.430
Okay, now we’re going to make some questions.

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:33.590
We know, “These are flowers”.

01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:39.720
When you want to make a question, you have
to change ‘these are’ and put the ‘be’

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720
verb first.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.360
So, it becomes, “Are these flowers?”.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.940
“Are these flowers?”

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.080
And the answer is “Yes, they are.”

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.450
Okay, now the flowers are far away.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:56.190
So we say, “Are those flowers?”.

01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:59.000
“Are those flowers?”

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.720
And again, the answer is “Yes, they are.”

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.720
Okay…

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.920
Now here, we have chairs.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.320
“Are these flowers?”

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.270
The answer is “No, they aren’t.”

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:17.170
Okay, now they’re far away.

01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:19.140
“Are those flowers?”

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.390
And again, the answer is “No, they aren’t.”

01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:24.890
How about these?

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:27.390
“Are these markers?”

01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:29.230
“Yes, they are.”

01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:32.260
“Are those markers?”

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.540
“Yes, they are.”

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.140
“Are these pens?”

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.570
“No, they aren’t.”

01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:43.360
“Are those pens?”

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.600
“No, they aren’t.”

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:51.890
Okay, so in this video, we learned how to
use ‘these’ and ‘those’.

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:56.080
I hope you guys understand and I’ll see
you in the next video.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.450
Bye.

01:11:57.450 --> 01:12:06.430
Okay, let’s do some practice with ‘this’,
‘that’, ‘these’, and ‘those’.

01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:09.920
First, I have this pen.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.830
I have to say, “This is a pen.”

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:15.330
“This is a pen.”

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:16.480
Okay…

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.200
Over there, “That is a pen.”

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.860
“That is a pen.”

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:27.770
Now, I have two pens.

01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:30.040
“These are pens.”

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.200
“These are pens.”

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.120
Okay, I’m going to move them far away.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.500
“Those are pens.”

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.690
“Those are pens.”

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.800
Okay, let’s move on to questions.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.350
I have one pen.

01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:50.260
“Is this a pen?”

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:53.090
“Yes, it is.”

01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:55.330
“Is this a cookie?”

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:58.720
“No, it isn’t.”

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.300
“Is that a pen?”

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.930
“Yes, it is.”

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.300
“Is that a cookie?”

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.660
“No, it isn’t.”

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.630
Okay, two pens.

01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:12.890
“Are these pens?”

01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:16.060
“Yes, they are.”

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.880
“Are these cookies?”

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.570
“No, they aren’t.”

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:24.360
Okay, now they’re over here.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.000
“Are those pens?”

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.970
Yes, they are?”

01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:31.580
“Are those cookies?”

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:34.050
“No, they aren’t.”

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:39.770
Okay, so that was our practice for ‘this’,
‘that’, ‘these’, and ‘those’.

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:44.770
I hope you guys understood and I’ll see
you in the next video.

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:46.920
Bye.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:51.230
Hi, everybody.

01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:55.850
In this video, we’re going to learn about
possessive adjectives.

01:13:55.850 --> 01:14:02.570
We use possessive adjectives to show that
something belongs to me or something belongs

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:04.340
to someone else.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:08.150
I own something or someone owns something.

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:09.150
Okay…

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:11.730
So let’s take a look at the board.

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:16.910
Now last time we learned about subjective
pronouns and here they are.

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:23.740
‘I’, ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’, ‘you’,
‘we’, ‘they’.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.630
And here are the possessive adjectives.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.870
Okay…

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:29.110
‘My’.

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:33.590
We use ‘my’ to show that something belongs
to me.

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:34.860
Okay…

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.120
‘His’.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:41.410
This means that something belongs to one man
or one boy.

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.880
‘Her’.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:49.750
We use that to show something belongs to one
woman or one girl.

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:51.630
‘Its’.

01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:57.980
We use ‘its’ to show that something belongs
to an animal.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:03.070
We use ‘your’ to show that something belongs
to you.

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:04.230
Okay…

01:15:04.230 --> 01:15:05.400
‘Our’.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:12.440
‘Our’ means that something belongs to
me and you or me and somebody else.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:15.290
Okay, or me and other people.

01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:17.280
Okay, and last.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.900
We use ‘their’ to show that something
belongs to many people.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.870
Okay, not me, but many people.

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:30.550
Okay, now I want you to pay attention to three
special words.

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:33.270
‘Its’, ‘your’ and ‘their’.

01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:37.940
Now I want you to notice these words sound
like other words.

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:41.730
So you have to be careful not to get them
confused.

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:43.740
And I’m going to explain.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:49.040
‘Its’ sounds like the contraction for
‘it is’; ‘it’s’.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.330
Okay, so, don’t get that confused.

01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:59.680
‘Your’ sounds like the contraction for
‘you are’ ‘you’re’.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.680
Okay…

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:04.200
So make sure you use this one to show possession.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.430
Okay…

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:11.090
And the last word, ‘their’, it actually
sounds like two other words.

01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:19.960
The contraction for ‘they are’ ‘they’re’
or the word t-h-e-r-e, the other word ‘there’.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960
Okay…

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.290
So please don’t get those confused.

01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:29.710
Now I know all of this sounds very hard, but
if you practice with me, I’m sure you’ll

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:30.710
understand.

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:32.570
So let’s move on to the next part.

01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:35.920
Okay, let’s practice together.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.180
Now, here I have a marker.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.640
It belongs to me.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.930
So, I have to say, “This is my marker.”

01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:48.010
“This isn’t your marker.”

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:50.290
“This is my marker.”

01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:54.260
Okay, let’s look at this boy.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.110
He has a hat.

01:16:56.110 --> 01:17:00.370
So, I have to say, “This is his hat.”

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:02.790
“This is his hat.”

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:05.220
“This isn’t my hat.”

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.960
“This isn’t your hat.”

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.230
Okay…

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.410
And this girl has a dress.

01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:13.990
So, “This is her dress.”

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:16.210
“This is her dress.”

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:18.210
“This isn’t my dress.”

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:20.280
“This isn’t your dress.”

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:28.610
Okay, in this picture there’s an animal;
a dog…and it has a ball.

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:32.210
I have to say, “This is its ball.”

01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:35.300
“This is its ball.”

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.770
“This isn’t my ball.”

01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:41.640
and “This isn’t your ball.”

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:45.130
Now, in this picture, we have two people.

01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:48.060
Okay, and they both own this house.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.250
So, “This is their house.”

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:54.130
“This is their house.”

01:17:54.130 --> 01:18:00.950
Okay, now a little bit farther away, we have
three books.

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:02.040
Okay…

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.850
And this boy and girl have the books here.

01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:12.980
So, we have to say “those” and because
we have more than one, we have to use ‘are’.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.150
Okay…

01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:17.130
“Those are their books.”

01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:21.470
“Those are their books.”

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:26.080
“Those aren’t my books.”

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.560
“Those aren’t your books.”

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.660
Okay…

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:31.810
And the last one.

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.850
Here’s the county Korea.

01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:36.410
Okay, we all live here.

01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:39.810
So we say, “This is our country.”

01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:42.790
“This is our country.”

01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:48.760
Okay, let’s move on to the next part for
some more practice.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:52.750
Okay, here are some practice sentences.

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:58.280
We’re going to put possessive adjectives
on these lines.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.280
Okay…

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.850
So, let’s try together.

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:05.600
“I put candy in ____ mouth.”

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.750
Okay, this is a mouth.

01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:13.150
“I put candy in ……” What should we
put?

01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:15.470
“my mouth.”

01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:17.800
Okay, next.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:18.960
“John.”

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:22.450
John is one man or boy.

01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:25.940
“John lost ____ bag.”

01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:30.570
Okay, for one man or boy, we say, “his”.

01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:34.080
“John lost his bag.”

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.710
Okay, “The parents…”

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:38.980
That’s more than one person.

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.250
That’s two people.

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:44.540
So, “The parents love ____ baby.”

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:48.620
We have to put…….”their”.

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:54.910
“The parents love their baby.”

01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:56.430
Okay…

01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:57.980
And here, “The dog…”

01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:01.060
Okay, ‘the dog’ is an animal.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:05.930
So, “The dog eats ____ food.”

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.930
What do we put?

01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:09.660
We have to say, “its”.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:12.840
“The dog eats its food.”

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.900
Okay, let’s look at some more examples.

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.530
Let’s continue.

01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:23.860
“_____ names are Paul and Sam.”

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:26.650
Okay, we have two people, Paul and Sam.

01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:29.050
And the plural names.

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:32.740
So we have to say, “Their”.

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:37.600
“Their names are Paul and Sam.”

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600
Okay…

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.140
“Can I use ____ phone?”

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:45.360
Okay, I’m asking you.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.720
So I have to say, “Can I use…your phone?”

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.620
Okay…

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.950
And the next one.

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:56.770
“_____ make-up looks good.”

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:58.180
Whose make-up?

01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:01.750
Well, usually girls or women wear make-up.

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:09.170
So, I’m going to say, “Her make-up looks
good.”

01:21:09.170 --> 01:21:11.520
Okay, and…

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.160
“_____ videos are helpful to you.”

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.700
Okay, these are the videos that we make.

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.700
Right?

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.270
We teach English in these videos.

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:23.670
So, the answer is “our”.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:27.200
“Our videos are helpful to you.”

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.880
or we sure hope they are.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:34.560
Okay, so in this video, we learned how to
use possessive adjectives.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:39.430
Don’t forget you have to put a noun after
each one.

01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:44.270
I hope you understand and I hope to see you
in the next video.

01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:46.300
Bye.

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:50.480
Hi, everybody and welcome.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.230
In this video, we’re going to learn about
possessive pronouns.

01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:55.230
Okay…

01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:59.870
And we use possessive pronouns to show that
something belongs to us

01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:03.000
or something is owned by us.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.410
Okay, or someone else.

01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:07.000
So, let’s take a look at the board.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.570
Now, last time we learned about subjective
pronouns.

01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:13.940
And here they are.

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:14.940
Okay…

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:19.880
And in another video, we talked about possessive
adjectives.

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.120
And here they are.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.120
Okay…

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.670
And over here are the possessive pronouns
that we’re going to talk about in this video.

01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:32.440
Now, possessive adjectives and possessive
pronouns are the same.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.630
They show possession.

01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:37.360
Which means, I own something.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.570
Something belongs to me…or to someone else.

01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:41.570
Okay…

01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:46.420
The only difference is that they’re used
a little differently.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:50.960
For possessive adjectives, you have to put
a noun after.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:51.960
Okay…

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.310
“My dog.”

01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:54.310
Okay…

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:59.380
But for possessive pronouns, you don’t have
to put a noun after it.

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.950
Okay, you can just say “mine”.

01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:02.950
Okay…

01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:05.250
So let’s go through each one.

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:06.310
“My.

01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:07.370
Mine.”

01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:08.430
Okay…

01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:11.600
And this is the same.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.600
“His.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.600
His.”

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:14.600
Okay…

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.020
For ‘her’, we say “hers”.

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.950
We add an ‘s’.

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:19.950
“Hers.”

01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:20.950
“Its.

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:21.950
Its.”

01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:24.840
Again, it’s the same.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.130
“Your.

01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:27.429
Yours.”

01:23:27.429 --> 01:23:30.160
We have to put an ‘s’.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.290
“Yours.”

01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:32.420
“Our.

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.440
Ours.”
and “Their.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.440
Theirs.”

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:41.170
Okay, again, I know that this can be really
confusing, but let’s practice some more.

01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:42.170
Okay…

01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:43.780
And let’s move on to the next part.

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.780
Okay, let’s practice together.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:50.290
Now, “This is my marker.”

01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:55.570
But with possessive pronouns, you do not have
to put a noun after.

01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:58.800
Okay, so I can say, “This is mine.”

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.950
“This isn’t yours.”

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:02.370
“This is mine.”

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.980
Okay, let’s look at the board.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:06.830
This boy has a hat.

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:10.590
So we say, “This is his.”

01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:11.640
“This isn’t mine.”

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.690
“This isn’t yours.”

01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:16.430
“This is his.”

01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:18.500
The girl has a dress.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:19.980
“This is hers.”

01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.920
“This isn’t mine.”

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.870
“This isn’t yours.”

01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:26.040
“This is hers.”

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.080
Okay…

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.900
Now with ‘its’, it’s kind of different.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:31.900
Okay…

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:36.890
You still have to put a noun, so you can’t
say, “This is its.”

01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:40.120
You have to say, “This is its ball.”

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.030
Again, “This is its ball.”

01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:44.770
“This isn’t mine.”

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:46.510
“This isn’t yours.”

01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:48.840
“This is its ball.”

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:49.840
Okay…

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:53.760
Now we have two people who have a house.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.270
“This is theirs.”

01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:56.890
“This isn’t mine.”

01:24:56.890 --> 01:24:58.500
“This isn’t yours.”

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.120
“This is theirs.”

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.120
Okay…

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:06.020
Now over here, we have some books and we’re
going to say that they belong to these two

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:07.020
people.

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:08.020
Okay…

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.150
So we’re going to use the plural ‘be’
verb; ‘are’.

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:13.150
Okay…

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.870
“These are theirs.”

01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:17.950
“These aren’t mine.”

01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:21.030
“These aren’t yours.”

01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:23.500
“These are theirs.”

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:24.960
Okay…

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.790
And last, we have a picture of Korea.

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:28.790
Okay…

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.630
“This is ours.”

01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:32.750
“This is ours.”

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:36.810
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:40.960
Okay, let’s look at these examples.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.120
We have to put in some possessive pronouns.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.120
Okay…

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:47.660
“That lipstick is _____.”

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:54.720
Okay, well we have the noun ‘lipstick’
and usually a girl or woman wears lipstick,

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:58.870
so we’re going to use the possessive pronoun
‘hers’.

01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:00.450
Okay…

01:26:00.450 --> 01:26:04.340
“That lipstick is hers.”

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.570
Okay…

01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:06.670
The next sentence.

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:10.590
“That sports car is _____.”

01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:11.590
Okay…

01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:15.830
Again, usually a man will drive a sports car.

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:21.410
So, we can say, “That sports car is his.”

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:23.140
Okay…

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:28.530
Now, let’s look at these last two.

01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:33.210
“This money is mine, not yours.”

01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:36.780
“This money is mine, it belongs to me.”

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.700
“It doesn’t belong to you.”

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:40.760
Not yours.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.830
Okay…

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:42.950
And the last one.

01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:44.190
“Dokdo is ours.”

01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:45.420
It’s Koreas.

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.420
Right…

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:47.420
“Not theirs.”

01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.160
Not Japans.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.250
“It belongs to us.”

01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:54.470
So we say, “It’s ours.”

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:58.660
Okay, so in this video, we learned possessive
pronouns.

01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:05.220
I hope you understand and I’ll see you in
the next video.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.090
Bye.

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:15.730
This is a checkup for ‘this’, ‘that’,
‘these’, ‘those’, possesive adjectives,

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.750
and possessive pronouns.

01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:18.790
Okay…

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:25.460
Now here, I want you to focus on ‘this’,
‘that’, ‘these’, and ‘those’.

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.170
Okay, so here’s the first example.

01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:31.250
We have a dog.

01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:32.580
One dog.

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:36.300
So we have to use ‘this’ or ‘that’.

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.300
Okay…

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:42.330
If it’s close, I say, “This is a dog.”

01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:47.470
If it’s far away, I say, “That is a dog.”

01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:51.370
So, I’m going to write ‘this’.

01:27:51.370 --> 01:27:53.180
Okay…

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:57.120
The next one says, “…are balloons.”

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.150
“…are balloons.”

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:00.150
With an ‘s’.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.300
There’s more than one.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.510
So can we use ‘this’ or ‘that’?

01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:06.510
No.

01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:09.780
We have to use ‘these’ or ‘those’.

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:15.780
So, if it’s close, I say “These are balloons.”

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:19.670
If they are far, “Those are balloons.”

01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:20.920
Okay…

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:24.720
So let’s write ‘those’.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.040
“Those are balloons.”

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.090
Okay…

01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:36.670
Now when we ask the question “Are these
pens?”, we have more than one.

01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:38.860
“These pens.”

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.490
With an ‘s’.

01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:41.490
Okay…

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:44.630
I can put two answers here.

01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:47.820
“No, ___ aren’t.”

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:51.560
I can say “No, these aren’t.”

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.640
Or…

01:28:52.640 --> 01:29:00.010
I can say “No, they aren’t.”

01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:02.290
Okay…

01:29:02.290 --> 01:29:03.830
The next one.

01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:07.160
“These ____ eyes.”

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.590
We need a ‘be’ verb.

01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:10.590
Okay…

01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:12.130
There’s more than one.

01:29:12.130 --> 01:29:14.440
Right, there are two eyes.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:18.990
So, “These are eyes.”

01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:20.490
Okay…

01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:23.750
And here “…is a nose.”

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:25.370
One.

01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:26.410
A nose.

01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:27.530
And it’s close.

01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:33.280
So, I have to say “This is a nose.”

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.820
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:37.900
Okay…

01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:41.230
We’re going to do some more checkup.

01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:47.440
Now here I want you to focus on possessive
adjectives and possessive pronouns.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.850
Let’s look at the first example.

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:52.590
“These are my pen.”

01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:54.810
Okay…

01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:59.440
We have ‘these…are’.

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.900
This means we need more than one.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:02.900
Right…

01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:04.230
More than one pen.

01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:06.720
So, we have to put ‘s’.

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.650
“These are my pens.”

01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:09.650
Okay…

01:30:09.650 --> 01:30:13.430
Let’s look at these two together.

01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:16.790
“Those aren’t her children.”

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:19.340
Okay…

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:24.100
So we can also say, “Those aren’t ____.”

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:26.150
What do we put?

01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:27.770
“… her children.”

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:32.420
We can always say, “Those aren’t hers.”

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:33.420
Okay…

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.560
We don’t need a noun here.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.380
We do need a noun over here, though.

01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:39.380
Okay…

01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:41.360
Then, “Is it yours?”

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.940
“Is it yours?”

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:46.530
“Yes, it’s _____.”

01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:49.110
There’s no noun.

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.780
We have to say…”mine”.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.990
“Is it yours?”

01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:58.380
“Yes, it’s mine.”

01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:59.510
Okay…

01:30:59.510 --> 01:31:05.320
And the last two…
” _____ these his shoes?”

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.650
We need a ‘be’ verb here.

01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:10.250
” _____ these his shoes?”

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:14.440
We have ‘these’ and we have ‘shoes’
with an ‘s’.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.880
So we need the plural ‘be’ verb.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.880
“Are”.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.630
“Are these his shoes?”

01:31:22.630 --> 01:31:23.630
Okay…

01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:25.060
And the answer.

01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.850
“No, they…”

01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:29.240
Plural.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.640
“…are.”

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.800
We have ‘no’.

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.810
“No, they aren’t”
Okay…

01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:37.070
“Are not, aren’t”.

01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:38.070
Okay…

01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:41.580
Let’s move on to the next part.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.120
Okay…

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.440
For this last part, we’re going to look
at these sentences.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.420
But, they’re all wrong.

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:51.420
They all have mistakes.

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.980
So you have to find the mistakes for me.

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:55.980
Okay…

01:31:55.980 --> 01:32:00.190
So, the first one says, “That are chairs.”

01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:03.450
Hmmmm, we know that’s wrong.

01:32:03.450 --> 01:32:06.750
‘That’ is used for singular nouns.

01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:07.750
One.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:13.670
But, it say “are” and it says “chairs”
with an ‘s’.

01:32:13.670 --> 01:32:18.220
So, we have to change this word.

01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:23.210
We can say, “These are chairs.”

01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:27.070
or “Those are chairs.”

01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:28.070
Okay…

01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:30.060
“This book is my.”

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.440
Hmm.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.990
We have the possessive pronoun ‘my’.

01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:41.370
But remember, you have to have a noun after,
but there’s no noun.

01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:46.950
So, we can change this to the possessive adjective
‘mine’.

01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:47.950
Okay…

01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:52.210
You don’t need a noun if you say ‘mine’.

01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:53.710
Okay…

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:56.980
“That is he house.”

01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:58.780
Hmm.

01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:04.920
We want to show that this house belongs to
this man or boy.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.840
“That is he house.”

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:11.750
But, this word ‘he’, does not show possession.

01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:13.270
Okay…

01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:18.660
So, we say, “This is his house.”

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:22.420
‘His’, then the noun ‘house’.

01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.580
Similarly, for the next one.

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:28.850
“She name is Jenny.”

01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:33.340
We want to show that this name belongs to
Jenny.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:36.340
So, we say…”her”.

01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:40.540
“Her name is Jenny.”

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:45.450
Okay, and the last one is also similar.

01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:47.280
“It’s ours house.”

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:52.340
Now, if we don’t have ‘house’, “It’s
ours.”

01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:53.980
We can say that.

01:33:53.980 --> 01:34:02.780
But since we have a noun,… we use the possessive
pronoun, “It’s ‘our’ house.”

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:03.800
Okay…

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:09.840
That was the checkup for possessive pronouns,
possessive adjectives, ‘this’, ‘that’,

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.160
‘these’, and ‘those’.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.390
I hope you understood and I’ll see you in
the next video.

01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:17.150
Bye.

01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:20.670
Hi, everybody.

01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:27.860
In this video, we’re going to talk about
the articles; ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’.

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:34.200
Now this can be very confusing, so please
make sure you pay careful attention.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:37.410
We use articles in front of nouns.

01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:41.800
Okay, so remember that and let’s look at
the board.

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:49.310
First, we use ‘a’ or ‘an’ when we’re
talking about any one thing.

01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:54.980
For example, let’s say I say, “A banana
is delicious.”

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.950
Okay, that means all bananas.

01:34:57.950 --> 01:35:00.150
Any banana is delicious.

01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:03.230
“A banana is delicious.”

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:06.400
Okay, let’s jump over here.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:12.050
If I’m talking about a specific banana…maybe
I have a banana in my hand.

01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:16.410
It’s specific, not any banana, this one.

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:21.320
I have to use ‘the’,
“The banana is old.”

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.260
Okay…

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.470
This one.

01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:27.940
I can’t say, “A banana is old.”

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:30.430
Then that means all bananas are old.

01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:32.040
And that’s not true.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.420
Just this one.

01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:36.650
So, I say, “The banana is old.”

01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:39.630
Okay, let’s move over here.

01:35:39.630 --> 01:35:46.030
We also use ‘a’ or ‘an’ when we’re
talking about something for the first time.

01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:49.220
So, I have another example here.

01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:51.240
“I watched a movie.”

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:52.240
Okay…

01:35:52.240 --> 01:36:00.140
I’m talking about this movie for the first
time, so I have to use “…a movie”.

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:07.190
But, if I want to talk about this movie again,
for the second time, or the third time or

01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:10.070
fourth, fifth…it doesn’t matter.

01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:12.530
I have to use ‘the’.

01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:15.150
“The movie was fun.”

01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:17.880
I’m talking about this one.

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.250
The specific.

01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:22.130
“The movie was fun.”

01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:25.270
I can’t say, “A movie was fun.”

01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:27.440
That means all movies are fun.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.590
That’s not true.

01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:30.750
“The movie was fun.”

01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:38.030
Okay, and I also use ‘the’ when I’m
talking about a noun where there’s only

01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:39.170
one and only.

01:36:39.170 --> 01:36:40.170
Okay…

01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:43.420
For example, there’s only one sun.

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:46.830
Okay, when I look at the sky, there’s only
one sun.

01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:49.800
So, I say, “The sun.”

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.490
“The sun is hot.”

01:36:51.490 --> 01:36:54.110
I cannot say, “A sun.”

01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:55.190
That’s wrong.

01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:58.390
When there’s one and only, we say, “The
sun.”

01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:59.390
Okay…

01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:02.480
Let’s look at some more examples.

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:06.760
The first example says, “A lion is dangerous.”

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:12.670
I have to use ‘a’ because I’m talking
about any one lion.

01:37:12.670 --> 01:37:15.130
Any lion is dangerous.

01:37:15.130 --> 01:37:16.800
All lions are dangerous.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:20.050
So, I use ‘a’.

01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:22.490
The next sentence says, “It’s a dog.”

01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:30.600
I’m talking about this dog for the first
time, so I use ‘a’.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:35.910
Now, I’m talking about this dog for the
second time.

01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:39.420
So, I say, “The dog is cute.”

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:40.530
Okay…

01:37:40.530 --> 01:37:43.230
Here’s a similar example.

01:37:43.230 --> 01:37:45.510
“It’s an ant.”

01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:51.140
Well, I used ‘an’ because we have ‘ant’,
which start with a vowel.

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.360
And I’m talking about this ant for the first
time.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.500
“It’s an ant.”

01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:01.290
Now, I’m talking about this ant again.

01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:03.890
“The ant is small.”

01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:08.060
“The ant…”, this one, “…is small.”

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:10.960
Okay, and the last one.

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.330
“It’s the moon.”

01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:18.240
I have to say, “the moon” because there’s
only one moon.

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.960
I cannot say, “a moon”.

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:24.330
“It’s the moon.

01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:27.790
The moon…”, only one, “…is round.”

01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:28.790
Okay…

01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:31.500
Let’s look at some more examples.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:38.840
Okay, we have some more examples, but this
time I want you to think about whether we

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.180
should put ‘a’, ‘an’ or ‘the’.

01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:43.180
Okay…

01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:48.590
So, “I see ____ desk and ___ chair.”

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:51.590
We don’t know which desk and chair.

01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:55.200
And it’s the first time I’m talking about
them.

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:58.340
So, we have to put ‘a’.

01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:05.520
“I see a desk and a chair.”

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:06.520
The next one.

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.270
“I see ____ octopus.”

01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:11.090
Okay, this is the same.

01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:15.140
It’s the first time I’m talking about
this octopus.

01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:19.840
So, do I put ‘a’ or ‘an’?

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.800
Well here we have the vowel ‘o’.

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.690
So we have to put “‘an’ octopus”.

01:39:25.690 --> 01:39:29.230
“I see an octopus.”

01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:31.370
Okay, the next one.

01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:33.110
“It’s ___ pen.”

01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:34.820
Okay, it’s the same.

01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:38.800
It’s the first time, so I say, “a pen”.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.610
Now, I’m talking about the pen for the second
time.

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:48.800
So I say, “The pen is red.”

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:51.650
Okay, I’m talking about this one.

01:39:51.650 --> 01:39:53.500
So I say, “the”.

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.240
Okay, similarly…

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.220
“She is ____ girl.”

01:39:58.220 --> 01:39:59.480
What do I say?

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.260
“A girl.”

01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:04.860
We’re talking about her for the first time.

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:05.860
Okay…

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:09.930
And now we’re talking about this girl again,
for the second time.

01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:16.060
So, I have to say, “The girl is pretty.”

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.500
And the last example.

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.310
“I can see ___ sky.”

01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:23.840
Now, we only have one sky.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.840
Right…

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:30.050
So, if there’s only one and only, we have
to put the article ‘the’.

01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:33.360
“I can see the sky.”

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.530
Okay…

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:40.880
So in this video, we talked about the articles
‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’.

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:45.300
I hope you understand and I’ll see you in
the next video.

01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.010
Bye.

01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:50.430
Hi, everybody.

01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:56.800
In this video, we’re going to talk about
the prepositions: in, on and under.

01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.030
Now, we use prepositions to show ‘where’
something is.

01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:03.940
So, let’s take a look at the board.

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:07.980
Okay, now in this picture, we have a cat.

01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:14.200
Okay, and we’re talking about this specific
cat, so we have to say “the cat”.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:17.051
Okay…
“…is in the box.”

01:41:17.051 --> 01:41:18.051
Okay…

01:41:18.051 --> 01:41:19.610
The preposition is ‘in’.

01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:22.221
“He’s ‘in’ the box.”

01:41:22.221 --> 01:41:24.580
“…’in’ the box.”

01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:25.580
Okay…

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:26.610
And the next one.

01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:29.250
“The cat is on…”

01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:32.120
The preposition ‘on’…”the chair”.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.150
“He’s on the chair.”

01:41:34.150 --> 01:41:35.150
Okay…

01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:37.080
And the next one.

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:42.130
“The cat is ‘under’…..’under’
the table.”

01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:44.640
“…’under’ the table.”

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.800
Okay…

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.670
Let’s look at the next one.

01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:50.970
Now we have plural nouns.

01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:53.570
“The apples ‘are’…”

01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:56.201
Okay…
“…in the box.”

01:41:56.201 --> 01:41:59.361
Again, the apples are “…’in’ the box.”

01:41:59.361 --> 01:42:00.361
Okay…

01:42:00.361 --> 01:42:06.370
Next, “The apples are ‘on’ the chair.”

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:07.370
And last.

01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:11.690
“The apples are ‘under’….’under’
the table.”

01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:15.670
Okay, let’s look at some more examples.

01:42:15.670 --> 01:42:23.730
Okay, let’s look at some pictures to help
us understand the prepositions: in, on, and

01:42:23.730 --> 01:42:24.730
under.

01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:26.800
I’m going to ask you some questions.

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.810
I want you to think about which one you should
use.

01:42:30.810 --> 01:42:32.040
Okay…

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:36.210
“Where is the dog?”

01:42:36.210 --> 01:42:39.760
“Where is the dog?”

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:46.280
“The dog is ‘in’ the doghouse.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.340
You should use the preposition ‘in’.

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:53.130
“The dog is ‘in’ the doghouse.

01:42:53.130 --> 01:42:57.300
“Where is the man?”

01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:02.511
“Where is the man?”

01:43:02.511 --> 01:43:04.980
“The man is ‘under’ the umbrella.”

01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:09.000
“The man is ‘under’ the umbrella.”

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.400
And last.

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:16.220
“Where are the girls?”

01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:18.541
“Where are the girls?”

01:43:18.541 --> 01:43:23.810
“The girls are ‘on’ the bridge.”

01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:28.010
“The girls are ‘on’ the bridge.”

01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:29.010
Okay…

01:43:29.010 --> 01:43:31.590
Let’s look at some more examples.

01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:32.880
Okay…

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:42.120
Now, we’re going to practice asking and
answering questions using: in, on and under.

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:46.050
First, let’s take a look at this picture.

01:43:46.050 --> 01:43:53.290
Here we have a rabbit, a chair and one, two,
three snakes.

01:43:53.290 --> 01:43:54.290
Okay…

01:43:54.290 --> 01:44:00.960
So, I will ask a question using in, on or
under.

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.550
I want you to think.

01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:05.290
Is the answer, “Yes, it is.”

01:44:05.290 --> 01:44:07.380
or “No, it isn’t.”

01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:08.380
Okay…

01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:10.760
Let’s start with the rabbit.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:16.760
“Is the rabbit under the chair?”

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.940
“No, it isn’t.”

01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:27.010
“Is the rabbit in the chair?”

01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:30.630
“No, it isn’t.”

01:44:30.630 --> 01:44:35.050
“Is the rabbit on the chair?”

01:44:35.050 --> 01:44:37.430
“…on the chair?”

01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:39.250
“Yes, it is.”

01:44:39.250 --> 01:44:40.250
Okay…

01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:44.880
Now, we’re going to move on to the snakes.

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:50.580
Now, there are…there are more than one,
right, so it’s plural, so we say, “Are

01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:52.940
the snakes…” with an ‘s’.

01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:53.940
Okay…

01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:54.940
So again, think.

01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:57.540
Is the answer, “Yes, they are.”

01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:59.860
or “No, they aren’t.”

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:07.170
“Are the snakes in the chair?”

01:45:07.170 --> 01:45:10.630
“No, they aren’t.”

01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:16.650
“Are the snakes on the chair?”

01:45:16.650 --> 01:45:20.390
“No, they aren’t.”

01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:25.980
“Are the snakes under the chair?”

01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.830
“Yes, they are.”

01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:31.320
Okay, how did you do?

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:37.830
I hope you guys understand how to use the
prepositions; in, on and under after watching

01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:38.830
this video.

01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:42.500
Thanks for joining and I’ll see you next
time.

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.290
Bye.

01:45:44.290 --> 01:45:47.870
Hi, everybody.

01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:50.740
In this video, we’re going to talk about
adjectives.

01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:56.130
Now, we use adjectives to describe nouns or
things.

01:45:56.130 --> 01:46:03.560
Okay, we can describe its size, its color,
its shape or other things like that.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.560
Okay…

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.970
So let’s take a look at the board.

01:46:06.970 --> 01:46:10.130
The first noun we’re going to use is ‘marker’.

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:11.740
“It’s a marker.”

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:17.920
Now, I want to use an adjective to describe
the color.

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.150
“It’s a ‘black’ marker.”

01:46:21.150 --> 01:46:23.860
‘Black’ is the adjective.

01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:33.480
Now notice, I have to put the adjective after
the article ‘a’, but before the noun ‘marker’.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.220
“It’s a black marker.”

01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:41.330
Now, I can use another adjective to describe
its size.

01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:43.400
“It’s a long marker.”

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:44.400
Okay…

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.970
Let’s try the next one.

01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:48.700
Here we have a bird.

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:51.180
So, “It’s a bird.”

01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:52.180
Okay…

01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:55.650
I want to use another adjective to describe
the color.

01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:59.370
So, I’m going to say, “It’s a blue bird.”

01:46:59.370 --> 01:47:07.210
Again, you have to put the adjective after
the article, before the noun.

01:47:07.210 --> 01:47:09.360
I can also describe its size.

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.270
“It’s a small bird.”

01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:15.380
‘Small’ is another adjective.

01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:19.780
Now, at the last part, we have some apples.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:21.240
Three apples.

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:26.590
Okay, remember, when we have more than one
noun, it’s called a plural noun.

01:47:26.590 --> 01:47:32.070
So, we have to say, “They’re apples.”,
with an ‘s’.

01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:33.670
“They’re apples.”

01:47:33.670 --> 01:47:39.010
I want to use the adjective ‘red’ to describe
the color of these apples.

01:47:39.010 --> 01:47:42.680
So, I’m going to say, “They’re red apples.”

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:43.680
Okay…

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.130
Here, there’s no article.

01:47:46.130 --> 01:47:48.200
There’s no ‘a’.

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.580
That’s because there’s more than one.

01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:52.680
“They’re red apples.”

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.700
So, I just have to put the adjective before
the noun that it’s describing.

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:01.010
“They’re red apples.”

01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:04.450
Okay, let’s move on to some more examples.

01:48:04.450 --> 01:48:05.650
Okay…

01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:13.060
Mow we’re going to practice asking and answering
questions using adjectives.

01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:14.100
Okay…

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:17.070
So, we have a man here.

01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:21.380
I want to ask, “Is he a small man?”

01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:22.570
Okay…

01:48:22.570 --> 01:48:24.620
We have the adjective ‘small’.

01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:32.970
Notice, even in a question, we have to put
the adjective agter the article and before

01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:33.970
the noun.

01:48:33.970 --> 01:48:36.410
“Is he a small man?”

01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:40.340
Well, let’s take a look at this picture.

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:45.420
The answer is “No, he’s a _____ man.”

01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:47.320
We need another adjective.

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:50.340
He’s not a small man.

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:55.370
So, we have to say “No, he’s a…big man.”

01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:56.370
Okay…

01:48:56.370 --> 01:49:00.360
We’re going to use the adjective ‘big’.

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.950
Okay, let’s look at the next one.

01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:06.630
“Is it a _____ table?”

01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:10.310
The answer is “Yes, it is.”

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:16.650
We need an adjective to describe color, shape
or size or something.

01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:19.620
Well, we can’t really describe the color.

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.810
So, I think we should try the shape.

01:49:22.810 --> 01:49:23.810
Okay…

01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:30.550
Well, “Is it a….round table?”

01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:33.430
And the answer is “Yes, it is.”

01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:37.060
Okay, and last, we have two dresses.

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:38.060
Okay…

01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:39.880
So that means the noun is plural.

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.800
In that case, for the questions, we begin
with ‘are’.

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:47.760
“Are they red dresses?”

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.910
Okay, the adjective is ‘red’.

01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:54.630
But, “Are they red dresses?”

01:49:54.630 --> 01:49:58.970
“No, they’re…blue dresses.”

01:49:58.970 --> 01:50:00.100
Okay…

01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:03.470
“No, they’re…blue dresses.”

01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:04.590
Okay…

01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:07.090
So in this video, we learned about adjectives.

01:50:07.090 --> 01:50:13.870
I hope you guys understand and I’ll see
you in the next video.

01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:17.730
Bye.

01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:22.340
This is a check-up video for articles, prepositions,
and adjectives.

01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:25.230
I’ve written some sentences on the board.

01:50:25.230 --> 01:50:28.280
Let’s try to finish them together.

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.750
Okay…

01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:34.800
The first sentence says, “It’s __ ___
umbrella.”

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:35.800
Okay…

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:36.890
We have the noun.

01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:41.470
We need an article and an adjective to describe
the umbrella.

01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:42.490
Okay…

01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:44.600
So here it is.

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:46.450
Let’s describe the color.

01:50:46.450 --> 01:50:47.510
Okay…

01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:49.870
We would say ‘black’.

01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:55.450
Remember, the adjective comes before the noun.

01:50:55.450 --> 01:50:57.010
Now we need an article.

01:50:57.010 --> 01:50:59.660
And the correct article is ‘a’.

01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:01.840
“It’s a black umbrella.”

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:02.840
Okay…

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:06.610
Next, “It’s ___ ___ ___.”

01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:08.460
We have three blanks.

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:11.250
Here, we have the noun ‘ant’.

01:51:11.250 --> 01:51:14.630
So we’re going to put that at the end.

01:51:14.630 --> 01:51:15.630
Okay…

01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:17.940
Let’s use the adjective ugly.

01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:18.940
Okay…

01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:23.600
Remember, again, the adjective comes before
the noun.

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.090
“…ugly ant.”

01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:28.070
“It’s __ ugly ant.”

01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:29.630
We need an article.

01:51:29.630 --> 01:51:36.440
Should we use ‘a’ or ‘an’?
well, ‘ugly’ starts with the vowel ‘u’,

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.610
so we have to say ‘an’.

01:51:38.610 --> 01:51:40.660
“It’s an ugly ant.”

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:41.660
Next.

01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:45.050
“It’s __ __ __.”

01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:46.050
Okay…

01:51:46.050 --> 01:51:48.880
We have the noun ‘car’.

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.890
So we put that at the end.

01:51:50.890 --> 01:51:55.940
Again, let’s use an adjective that describes
the color.

01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:58.960
Let’s use ‘blue’.

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:00.860
Okay…

01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:03.670
What article should we use?

01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:05.160
We have to say “a”.

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:07.610
“It’s a blue car.”

01:52:07.610 --> 01:52:09.540
Okay, and last.

01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:12.590
“I __ ___ nice girl.”

01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:13.820
That’s me.

01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:17.940
We have the noun ‘girl’…and the adjective
‘nice’.

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:19.480
So we need the article.

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:21.370
We’re going to say “a”.

01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:24.690
Now, we’re missing one more thing.

01:52:24.690 --> 01:52:26.940
We need the ‘be’ verb ‘am’.

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:29.740
“I am a nice girl.”

01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:33.590
Okay, let’s move on to the next part.

01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:37.460
Okay, let’s continue with the checkup.

01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:39.110
Here’s a picture.

01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:40.110
Okay…

01:52:40.110 --> 01:52:41.810
Look at it carefully.

01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:44.250
“What is it?”

01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:46.690
“What is it?”

01:52:46.690 --> 01:52:49.130
“It’s __ banana.”

01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:51.690
We need an article here.

01:52:51.690 --> 01:52:57.210
And it’s the first time I’m talking about
this, so we’re going to say “a”.

01:52:57.210 --> 01:52:59.950
“It’s a banana.”

01:52:59.950 --> 01:53:04.230
“Where is ___ banana?”

01:53:04.230 --> 01:53:08.170
Now, you know, I’m talking about this one.

01:53:08.170 --> 01:53:09.640
It’s specific.

01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:13.880
So, I’m going to use the article ‘the’.

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:19.460
“Where is the banana?”

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:22.030
And now, let’s think about the preposition.

01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:27.730
“It’s __ the chair.”

01:53:27.730 --> 01:53:30.750
We need to use the preposition ‘on’.

01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:33.330
“It’s on the chair.”

01:53:33.330 --> 01:53:34.650
Okay…

01:53:34.650 --> 01:53:37.020
Let’s move on.

01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:40.200
“What are they?”

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:41.260
Okay…

01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:44.440
“They’re ____ oranges.”

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.500
Okay…

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:46.730
We have more than one.

01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:52.880
That’s why we said, “They are…they’re”
and “oranges”…with an ‘s’.

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:53.880
Okay…

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.340
Can we use ‘the’?

01:53:55.340 --> 01:54:02.830
No, you don’t know what oranges I’m talking
about because it’s the first time I said

01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:05.050
anything about them.

01:54:05.050 --> 01:54:08.160
Then, can I use ‘a’ or ‘an’?

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:13.270
No, ‘a’ or ‘an’ is used for any one
thing.

01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:16.550
So here we do not need any article.

01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:18.330
“They’re oranges.”

01:54:18.330 --> 01:54:20.390
“What are they?”

01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:22.330
“They’re oranges.”

01:54:22.330 --> 01:54:23.330
Okay…

01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:27.180
“Where __ __ oranges?”

01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:28.180
Okay…

01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:36.540
Now, again, you know I’m talking about these
specific oranges, so we use ‘the’.

01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:40.440
“Where __ the oranges?”

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:47.120
Okay, remember, when you ask a question with
plural, you need ‘are’.

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.980
“Where are the oranges?”

01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:50.980
Okay…

01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:54.570
Now, let’s think about the preposition.

01:54:54.570 --> 01:54:57.200
“They’re ___ the chair.”

01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:01.590
Okay…

01:55:01.590 --> 01:55:04.570
The preposition we need is ‘under’.

01:55:04.570 --> 01:55:05.870
Okay…

01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:10.340
They’re not ‘on’, “they’re ‘under’
the chair.”

01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:13.490
Okay, let’s move on to the last part.

01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:17.350
Okay, let’s continue with the checkup.

01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:21.080
Now, we have two short stories here.

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.430
You have to help me find the mistakes.

01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:27.710
The first sentence says, “It’s snake.”

01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:31.150
Well, we’re missing an article.

01:55:31.150 --> 01:55:32.150
Okay…

01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:33.960
And that article is ‘a’.

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:36.860
“It’s a snake.”

01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:37.860
Okay…

01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:41.480
“It’s blue a snake.”

01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:43.740
Can you find the mistake?

01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:44.920
Okay…

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:52.860
Remember, the adjective ‘blue’ has to
go between the article and the noun.

01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:56.490
So we have to move the article to the front.

01:55:56.490 --> 01:55:59.940
“It’s a blue snake.”

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.250
That is the correct answer.

01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:03.740
“It’s a blue snake.”

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:06.260
Okay, the next one.

01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:09.710
“The snake under the box.”

01:56:09.710 --> 01:56:11.230
It sounds right.

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:16.780
“The snake under the box.”, but we forgot
the ‘be’ verb.

01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:20.771
“The snake is under the box.”

01:56:20.771 --> 01:56:23.850
Okay, let’s move on to the next story.

01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:26.370
“It’s a octopus.”

01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:34.830
Okay, we have an article, but octopus starts
with the vowel ‘o’.

01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:35.990
So we have to use ‘an’.

01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:39.230
“It’s an octopus.”

01:56:39.230 --> 01:56:43.360
“An octopus is big.”

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.360
Hmmm…

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.280
This one’s a little bit hard.

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:51.630
But remember, we’re talking about the same
octopus.

01:56:51.630 --> 01:56:55.860
So now, this octopus is specific.

01:56:55.860 --> 01:57:01.040
So we have to change the article ‘an’
to ‘the’.

01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:04.960
“The octopus is big.”

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.580
The octopus from the first sentence.

01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:12.690
Last, “The octopus are under the chair.”

01:57:12.690 --> 01:57:15.730
What’s the mistake?

01:57:15.730 --> 01:57:17.480
“The octopus…”

01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:20.100
There’s only one.

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:24.000
So we don’t use ‘are’, we have to say
“is”.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.870
“The octopus is under the chair.”

01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:29.690
Okay…

01:57:29.690 --> 01:57:34.360
So that was our checkup for articles, prepositions
and adjectives.

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:38.790
I hope you guys understand better and I’ll
see you in the next video.

01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:40.980
Thank you.

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:42.080
Bye.

01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.270
Hi, everybody.

01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:49.650
In this video, we’re going to learn ‘have’
and ‘has’.

01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:54.870
Now we use ‘have’ or ‘has’ to show
possession.

01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:57.690
To show something belongs to you.

01:57:57.690 --> 01:57:58.690
Okay…

01:57:58.690 --> 01:58:02.540
So, let’s take a look at the board.

01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:03.540
Okay…

01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:08.670
When you’re talking about ‘you’, or
me, we say, “I have…”

01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:09.670
Okay…

01:58:09.670 --> 01:58:16.510
If something belongs to a boy or man, we say,
“He has…”

01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:19.500
For a girl or a woman.

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.600
“She has…”

01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:23.870
For an animal or thing.

01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:26.270
“It has…”

01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:31.070
For you, “You have…”

01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:32.070
For us.

01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:33.800
Me and some other people.

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:36.140
We say, “We have…”

01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:38.470
Okay, and some other people.

01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:40.530
“They have…”

01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:41.550
Okay…

01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:45.150
This is very easy, you just have to remember
it.

01:58:45.150 --> 01:58:46.150
Okay…

01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:49.710
So, let’s practice with these pictures.

01:58:49.710 --> 01:58:54.630
Here we have a rabbit…and a carrot.

01:58:54.630 --> 01:58:57.460
So which one do we have to use?

01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:00.920
Well, a rabbit is an animal.

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:02.680
So we have to use ‘it’.

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:05.460
“It has a carrot.”

01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:09.610
Again, “It has a carrot.”

01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:14.380
Now, in this picture, we have two ants.

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:15.540
Okay…

01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:20.110
So, for two things we have to use ‘they’.

01:59:20.110 --> 01:59:21.110
Okay…

01:59:21.110 --> 01:59:24.060
So, here are two ants and an apple.

01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:28.880
So, we’re going to say, “They have an
apple.”

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:32.530
“They have an apple.”

01:59:32.530 --> 01:59:36.270
Okay, let’s move on to some more practice.

01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:37.460
Okay…

01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:41.900
Let’s do some practice together.

01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:47.260
You have to think about if we should use ‘have’
or ‘has’ in the blanks.

01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:48.260
Okay…

01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:49.800
So let’s look at the first one.

01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:52.620
“The girl ‘blank’ long hair.”

01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:53.620
Okay…

01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:55.350
Now, ‘the girl’.

01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:59.090
We can we use instead of the girl?

01:59:59.090 --> 02:00:01.130
We can say “she”.

02:00:01.130 --> 02:00:04.490
“She” then what do we say?

02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:05.740
“Has.”

02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:08.150
“She has long hair.”

02:00:08.150 --> 02:00:09.150
Or…

02:00:09.150 --> 02:00:11.150
“The girl has long hair.”

02:00:11.150 --> 02:00:13.180
It’s the same.

02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.180
Okay…

02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:15.180
The next one.

02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:16.180
“The boys…”

02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:18.610
Now, there’s an ‘s’ here.

02:00:18.610 --> 02:00:21.800
That means there’s more than one boy.

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:26.160
When we have more than one thing, what do
we use?

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:27.450
“They.”

02:00:27.450 --> 02:00:28.730
Okay…

02:00:28.730 --> 02:00:30.020
“They…”

02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:32.870
Do we say ‘have’ or ‘has’?

02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:35.850
We have to say “have”.

02:00:35.850 --> 02:00:38.170
“They have caps.”

02:00:38.170 --> 02:00:39.170
Or…

02:00:39.170 --> 02:00:40.570
“The boys have caps.”

02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:44.310
Okay, the next one’s easier.

02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:45.310
“I…”

02:00:45.310 --> 02:00:49.660
When we have ‘I’, we say “have”.

02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:52.000
“I have a friend.”

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.650
Okay, the next one is also easy.

02:00:55.650 --> 02:00:56.650
“He…”

02:00:56.650 --> 02:01:00.740
“He ‘blank’ an umbrella.”

02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:02.810
What do we have to use?

02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:04.090
“Has.”

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:06.940
“He has an umbrella.”

02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:13.950
Okay, the next one says, “The dog ‘blank’
a bone.”

02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:15.550
“The dog…”

02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:18.600
What do we use for animals?

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.730
“It.”

02:01:20.730 --> 02:01:23.700
“It…has a bone.”

02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:24.700
Or…

02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:28.360
“The dog has a bone.”

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:29.360
And last.

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.050
“My mother and I ‘blank’ a car.”

02:01:34.050 --> 02:01:35.420
Okay, this one’s tricky.

02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:38.550
“My mother and I…”

02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:43.050
We have to say “we”.

02:01:43.050 --> 02:01:45.720
“We…have…a car.”

02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:50.400
“My mother and I have a car.”

02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:52.210
Okay…

02:01:52.210 --> 02:01:56.820
So I hope you understand how to use ‘have’
and ‘has’ and I’ll see you in the next

02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:58.650
video.

02:01:58.650 --> 02:02:00.490
Bye.

02:02:00.490 --> 02:02:04.160
Hi, everybody.

02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:08.920
In this video, we’re going to learn negatives
with ‘have’ and ‘has’.

02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:11.610
Now this also pretty easy.

02:02:11.610 --> 02:02:15.070
You just have to remember everything that
I wrote.

02:02:15.070 --> 02:02:16.070
Okay…

02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:18.080
So let’s take a look at the board.

02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:25.020
Okay, first, for ‘I’, we use, “I don’t
have…”

02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:30.590
Remember, ‘don’t’ is a contraction for
‘do not’.

02:02:30.590 --> 02:02:33.880
“I don’t have…”

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:39.250
For ‘he, ‘she’ and ‘it’, we use
‘doesn’t have’.

02:02:39.250 --> 02:02:45.000
‘Doesn’t’ is a contraction for ‘does
not’.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.880
“He doesn’t have…”

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:50.750
“She doesn’t have…”

02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:53.630
“It doesn’t have…”

02:02:53.630 --> 02:02:55.150
Now on the bottom.

02:02:55.150 --> 02:03:00.940
For ‘you’, ‘we’, ‘they’, it’s
the same as ‘I’.

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.700
We use ‘don’t have’.

02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:04.880
“You don’t have…”

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:09.940
“We don’t have…”
and “They don’t have…”

02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:12.570
So, let’s look at these pictures.

02:03:12.570 --> 02:03:15.480
Remember, we have a rabbit and a carrot.

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:19.110
So, we said, “It has a carrot.”

02:03:19.110 --> 02:03:26.930
Okay, but, we’re doing negatives, so we
have to say “It doesn’t have a cake.”

02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:31.270
“It doesn’t have a cake.”

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.270
Okay…

02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:37.190
Now here, we have the ants and an apple.

02:03:37.190 --> 02:03:40.150
So we said, “They have an apple.”

02:03:40.150 --> 02:03:42.070
Okay…

02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:49.100
But for this banana here, we have to say,
“They don’t have a banana.”

02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:52.570
“They don’t have a banana.”

02:03:52.570 --> 02:03:55.780
Okay, let’s move on to some more practice.

02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:56.860
Okay…

02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:04.420
Now let’s try this practice with the negatives
‘doesn’t have’ and ‘don’t have’

02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:05.420
together.

02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:11.280
Now this is a little easy because we know
that the second word is have.

02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:15.480
All you have to think is should we use ‘doesn’t’
or ‘don’t’.

02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:16.480
Okay…

02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:20.540
So, I’m just going to put ‘have’ her
first.

02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:21.540
Okay…

02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:24.990
“She ‘blank’ have short hair.”

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:28.900
Should we use ‘don’t’ or ‘doesn’t’?

02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:33.270
If you remember, for ‘she’, we use ‘doesn’t’.

02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:37.910
“She doesn’t have short hair.”

02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:38.910
Okay…

02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:43.590
And again, I’m going to put ‘have’ first.

02:04:43.590 --> 02:04:44.590
This is easy.

02:04:44.590 --> 02:04:48.220
‘He’ and ‘she’ we both use ‘doesn’t’.

02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:53.140
“He doesn’t have an umbrella.”

02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:55.260
Okay…

02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:56.670
How about for ‘I’?

02:04:56.670 --> 02:05:02.490
“I doesn’t have….” or ” I don’t
have…”?

02:05:02.490 --> 02:05:05.110
The correct answer is ‘don’t’.

02:05:05.110 --> 02:05:09.000
“I don’t have a wife.”

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.360
“People…”

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:21.060
Remember, if we have more than one person,
animal and thing, we have to think of ‘they’.

02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:25.200
For ‘they’, do we use ‘don’t’ or
‘ doesn’t’?

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:27.260
Do you remember?

02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:29.930
The correct answer is ‘don’t’.

02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:34.250
“People don’t have manners.”

02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:35.630
Okay…

02:05:35.630 --> 02:05:37.020
Next.

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:38.400
“We…”

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:42.690
“We ‘blank’ have money.”

02:05:42.690 --> 02:05:46.840
Should we put ‘doesn’t’ or ‘don’t’?

02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:49.400
The correct answer is ‘don’t’.

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.920
“We don’t have money.”

02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:55.170
Okay, and the last one.

02:05:55.170 --> 02:05:56.170
“A snake…”

02:05:56.170 --> 02:06:02.440
A snake is an animal.

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:05.110
What do we use for an animal?

02:06:05.110 --> 02:06:06.670
“It.”

02:06:06.670 --> 02:06:08.240
“It…”

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:10.750
What should we put here?

02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:14.160
“It…doesn’t…have legs.”

02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:20.670
Okay, so that was our practice the negatives
‘don’t have’ and ‘doesn’t have’.

02:06:20.670 --> 02:06:24.860
I hope you understand and I’ll see you in
the next video.

02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:26.580
Bye.

02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:30.030
Hi, everybody.

02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:34.740
In this video, we’re going to learn how
to ask questions using ‘have’.

02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:38.990
Okay, let’s look at the board.

02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:46.210
When we are talking about ‘he’, ‘she’
or ‘it’, the question always begins with

02:06:46.210 --> 02:06:47.590
‘does’.

02:06:47.590 --> 02:06:49.590
After the pronoun, we have ‘have’.

02:06:49.590 --> 02:06:52.960
So, we say, “Does he have…”

02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.810
“Does she have…”

02:06:54.810 --> 02:06:56.340
“Does it have…”

02:06:56.340 --> 02:07:01.560
Now, let’s practice with this question and
let’s look at the two answers.

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:02.560
Okay…

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:06.030
“Does he have a friend?”

02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:13.490
If the answer is ‘yes’, we say “yes”,
in the blank, we match… this has to be the

02:07:13.490 --> 02:07:14.490
same.

02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:16.690
“Yes, he does.”

02:07:16.690 --> 02:07:18.370
If the answer is ‘no’.

02:07:18.370 --> 02:07:20.470
“No, he doesn’t.”

02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:23.280
“Does he have a friend?”

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:25.850
“Yes, she does.”

02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:28.600
“No, she doesn’t.”

02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:31.920
“Does it have a friend?”

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:34.470
“Yes, it does.”

02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:36.970
“No, it doesn’t.”

02:07:36.970 --> 02:07:39.960
Okay, so remember ‘does…have’.

02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:48.380
Now, when we use ‘you’, ‘we’, ‘they’,
we use ‘do’ in the front.

02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:50.270
And ‘have’ after.

02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:52.500
“Do you have a friend?”

02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:55.170
“Do we have a friend?”

02:07:55.170 --> 02:07:57.510
“Do they have a friend?”

02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:58.550
Okay…

02:07:58.550 --> 02:08:01.240
And again we have two answers.

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:04.110
We finish with ‘do’ or ‘don’t’.

02:08:04.110 --> 02:08:07.130
So, “Do you have a friend?”

02:08:07.130 --> 02:08:09.350
“Yes, I do.”

02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:13.360
Right, the questions is asking ‘you’,
so you say “I do.”

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.620
Or, “No, I don’t.”

02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:19.110
“Do we have a friend?”

02:08:19.110 --> 02:08:20.630
“Yes, we do.”

02:08:20.630 --> 02:08:23.630
Or, “No, we don’t.”

02:08:23.630 --> 02:08:25.130
And last.

02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:27.220
“Do they have a friend?”

02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:29.500
“Yes, they do.”

02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:31.770
“No, they don’t.”

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:35.380
Okay, let’s move on to some more practice.

02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:40.990
Alright, let’s try this practice together.

02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:44.390
I know it looks hard, but I’m going to help
you.

02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:45.430
Okay…

02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:47.680
So let’s look at the first practice.

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:49.990
It’s a question.

02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:56.110
Okay, so remember, when we ask a question,
we begin with ‘do’ or ‘does’.

02:08:56.110 --> 02:08:57.170
Okay…

02:08:57.170 --> 02:08:58.710
We have ‘she’.

02:08:58.710 --> 02:09:02.500
well, remember for all questions we use ‘have’.

02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:08.260
In the front, should we use ‘does’ or
‘do’?

02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:09.880
The answer is ‘does’.

02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:13.840
“Does she have a dress?”

02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:17.100
When we answer, “Yes…”

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:18.750
What do we put here?

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:22.630
Remember, we put the pronoun ‘she’.

02:09:22.630 --> 02:09:24.930
And the answer ‘does’.

02:09:24.930 --> 02:09:28.929
“Yes, she does.”

02:09:28.929 --> 02:09:29.929
The next one.

02:09:29.929 --> 02:09:30.929
We have ‘they’.

02:09:30.929 --> 02:09:34.340
Okay, ‘have’ is again the same.

02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:36.420
“…have a bicycle?”

02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:39.650
Okay, what goes in the front?

02:09:39.650 --> 02:09:42.230
For ‘they’. we use ‘do’.

02:09:42.230 --> 02:09:46.610
“Do they have a bicycle?”

02:09:46.610 --> 02:09:49.410
This time the answer is negative.

02:09:49.410 --> 02:09:52.340
“No, they….”

02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:53.340
What do we put here?

02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:56.540
It doesn’t make sense to say, “do”.

02:09:56.540 --> 02:09:57.540
Right?

02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:58.540
“No, they do.”

02:09:58.540 --> 02:09:59.540
That’s wrong.

02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:00.670
It’s a negative.

02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:03.780
We have to say, “No, they don’t.”

02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:06.640
“No, they do not.”

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:12.390
Okay, and again, we have ‘have’ over here.

02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:13.480
“It…”

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:16.190
Which one, ‘do’ or ‘does’?

02:10:16.190 --> 02:10:17.780
The answer is ‘does’.

02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:21.290
“Does it have a ball?”

02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:24.240
Again, the answer is negative.

02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:27.990
“No, it…does not.”

02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:32.070
or the contraction, “No, it doesn’t.”

02:10:32.070 --> 02:10:33.690
Okay…

02:10:33.690 --> 02:10:37.260
So that was our practice for asking questions
with ‘have’.

02:10:37.260 --> 02:12:26.590
I hope you understand 

02:12:26.590 --> 02:15:23.550
and I’ll see 

02:15:23.550 --> 02:15:24.770
you in the next video.
